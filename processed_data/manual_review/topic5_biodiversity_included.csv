While regenerating trees sequester carbon relatively quickly, the pace of biodiversity recovery remains contentious. Here, we use bioacoustics and metabarcoding to measure forest recovery post-agriculture in a global biodiversity hotspot in Ecuador. We show that the community composition, and not species richness, of vocalizing vertebrates identified by experts reflects the restoration gradient. Two automated measures - an acoustic index model and a bird community composition derived from an independently developed Convolutional Neural Network - correlated well with restoration (adj-R² = 0.62 and 0.69, respectively). Importantly, both measures reflected composition of non-vocalizing nocturnal insects identified via metabarcoding. We show that such automated monitoring tools, based on new technologies, can effectively monitor the success of forest recovery, using robust and reproducible data.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Erik""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: biodiversity","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-41693-w",NA,NA,NA

However, these models may also confer easy access to dual-use technologies capable of inflicting great harm. To evaluate this risk, the 'Safeguarding the Future' course at MIT tasked non-scientist students with investigating whether LLM chatbots could be prompted to assist non-experts in causing a pandemic. In one hour, the chatbots suggested four potential pandemic pathogens, explained how they can be generated from synthetic DNA using reverse genetics, supplied the names of DNA synthesis companies unlikely to screen orders, identified detailed protocols and how to troubleshoot them, and recommended that anyone lacking the skills to perform reverse genetics engage a core facility or contract research organization. Collectively, these results suggest that LLMs will make pandemic-class agents widely accessible as soon as they are credibly identified, even to people with little or no laboratory training. Promising nonproliferation measures include pre-release evaluations of LLMs by third parties, curating training datasets to remove harmful concepts, and verifiably screening all DNA generated by synthesis providers or used by contract research organizations and robotic cloud laboratories to engineer organisms or viruses.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Erik""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: biodiversity","https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2306.03809",NA,NA,NA

Camera traps represent a passive monitoring technique that generates millions of ecological images. The vast numbers of images drive automated ecological analysis as essential, given that manual assessment of large datasets is laborious, time-consuming, and expensive. Deep learning networks have been advanced in the last few years to solve object and species identification tasks in the computer vision domain, providing state-of-the-art results. In our work, we trained and tested machine learning models to classify three animal groups (snakes, lizards, and toads) from camera trap images. We experimented with two pretrained models, VGG16 and ResNet50, and a self-trained convolutional neural network (CNN-1) with varying CNN layers and augmentation parameters. For multiclassification, CNN-1 achieved 72% accuracy, whereas VGG16 reached 87%, and ResNet50 attained 86% accuracy. These results demonstrate that the transfer learning approach outperforms the self-trained model performance. The models showed promising results in identifying species, especially those with challenging body sizes and vegetation.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Erik""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: biodiversity","https://doi.org/10.3390/ani13091526",NA,NA,NA
"rayyan-100676989","<i>TreeSatAI Benchmark Archive</i>: a multi-sensor, multi-label dataset for tree species classification in remote sensing",NA,1,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"en",NA,NA,"Abstract. Airborne and spaceborne platforms are the primary data sources for large-scale forest mapping, but visual interpretation for individual species determination is labor-intensive. Hence, various studies focusing on forests have investigated the benefits of multiple sensors for automated tree species classification. However, transferable deep learning approaches for large-scale applications are still lacking. This gap motivated us to create a novel dataset for tree species classification in central Europe based on multi-sensor data from aerial, Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 imagery. In this paper, we introduce the TreeSatAI Benchmark Archive, which contains labels of 20 European tree species (i.e., 15 tree genera) derived from forest administration data of the federal state of Lower Saxony, Germany. We propose models and guidelines for the application of the latest machine learning techniques for the task of tree species classification with multi-label data. Finally, we provide various benchmark experiments showcasing the information which can be derived from the different sensors including artificial neural networks and tree-based machine learning methods. We found that residual neural networks (ResNet) perform sufficiently well with weighted precision scores up to 79 % only by using the RGB bands of aerial imagery. This result indicates that the spatial content present within the 0.2 m resolution data is very informative for tree species classification. With the incorporation of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 imagery, performance improved marginally. However, the sole use of Sentinel-2 still allows for weighted precision scores of up to 74 % using either multi-layer perceptron (MLP) or Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) models. Since the dataset is derived from real-world reference data, it contains high class imbalances. We found that this dataset attribute negatively affects the models' performances for many of the underrepresented classes (i.e., scarce tree species). However, the class-wise precision of the best-performing late fusion model still reached values ranging from 54 % (Acer) to 88 % (Pinus). Based on our results, we conclude that deep learning techniques using aerial imagery could considerably support forestry administration in the provision of large-scale tree species maps at a very high resolution to plan for challenges driven by global environmental change.

Hyperspectral remote sensing of plant canopies offers a key tool to map multiple plant traits. However, we are still lacking generalized methods to translate hyperspectral reflectance into a suite of relevant plant traits across biomes, land cover and sensor types. The absence of globally representative data sets and the gap between the available reflectance data with corresponding in-situ measurements have hampered such approaches. In recent years, the scientific community acquired multiple data sets encompassing canopy hyperspectral reflectance and plant traits from different plant types and sensors. To combine these heterogeneous data sets, we propose three multi-trait modeling approaches based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to simultaneously infer a broad set of 20 structural and chemical traits (e.g. leaf mass per area, leaf area index, pigments, nitrogen). The performance of these multi-trait CNN models predicting these traits was compared against single-trait CNN as well as single-trait partial least squares regression (PLSR). We found that the multi-trait CNNs performances significantly increased from single-trait CNNs (nRMSE = 0.027–19.61%) and the state-of-the-art PLSR models (nRMSE = 1.94–40.07%) across a broad range of vegetation types (crops, forest, tundra, grassland, shrubland) and sensor types. Thus, providing a single model for multiple traits not only proved to be computationally more efficient, but also more accurate, since it enabled the model to incorporate traits' co-variation. Despite the data heterogeneity of the merged data set, our models performances' were comparable or exceeded those of previous studies. Overall, this study highlights the potential of weakly supervised approaches to overcome the scarcity of in-situ measurements and take a step forward in creating efficient predictive models of multiple biochemical and biophysical vegetation properties.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Erik""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: biodiversity","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2023.113580",NA,NA,NA

Biotechnological applications of biosystems, including pathways, enzymes, and whole cells, are being probed frequently with time. The intricacy and interconnectedness of biosystems make it challenging to design them with the desired properties. ML and DL have a synergy with synthetic biology. Synthetic biology can be employed to produce large data sets for training models (for instance, by utilizing DNA synthesis), and ML/DL models can be employed to inform design (for example, by generating new parts or advising unrivaled experiments to perform). This potential has recently been brought to light by research at the intersection of engineering biology and ML/DL through achievements like the design of novel biological components, best experimental design, automated analysis of microscopy data, protein structure prediction, and biomolecular implementations of ANNs (Artificial Neural Networks). I have divided this review into three sections.

Ocean sound is considered an essential ocean variable, with the potential to improve our understanding of its impact on marine life. Fish produce a variety of sounds and their choruses often dominate underwater soundscapes. These sounds have been used to assess communication, behaviour, spawning location, and biodiversity. Artificial intelligence can provide a robust solution to detect and classify fish sounds. However, the main challenge in applying artificial intelligence to recognize fish sounds is the lack of validated sound data for individual species.

Autonomous recording units (ARUs) can provide cost-effective, long-term and systematic species monitoring data for sound-producing wildlife, including birds, amphibians, insects and mammals over large areas. Modern deep learning can efficiently automate the detection of species occurrences in these sound data with high accuracy. Further, citizen science can be leveraged to scale up the deployment of ARUs and collect reference vocalizations needed for training and validating deep learning models. In this study we develop a convolutional neural network (CNN) acoustic classification pipeline for detecting 54 bird species in Sonoma County, California USA, with sound and reference vocalization data collected by citizen scientists within the Soundscapes to Landscapes project (www.soundscapes2landscapes.org). We trained three ImageNet-based CNN architectures (MobileNetv2, ResNet50v2, ResNet100v2), which function as a Mixture of Experts (MoE), to evaluate the usefulness of several methods to enhance model accuracy. Specifically, we: 1) quantify accuracy with fully-labeled 1-min soundscapes for an assessment of real-world conditions; 2) assess the effect on precision and recall of additional pre-training with an external sound archive (xeno-canto) prior to fine-tuning with vocalization data from our study domain; and, 3) assess how detections and errors are influenced by the presence of coincident biotic and non-biotic sounds (i.e., soundscape components). In evaluating accuracy with soundscape data (n = 37 species) across CNN probability thresholds and models, we found acoustic pre-training followed by fine-tuning improved average precision by 10.3% relative to no pre-training, although there was a small average 0.8% reduction in recall. In selecting an optimal CNN architecture for each species based on maximum F(β = 0.5), we found our MoE approach had total precision of 84.5% and average species precision of 85.1%. Our data exhibit multiple issues arising from applying citizen science and acoustic monitoring at the county scale, including deployment of ARUs with relatively low fidelity and recordings with background noise and overlapping vocalizations. In particular, human noise was significantly associated with more incorrect species detections (false positives, decreased precision), while physical interference (e.g., recorder hit by a branch) and geophony (e.g., wind) was associated with the classifier missing detections (false negatives, decreased recall). Our process surmounted these obstacles, and our final predictions allowed us to demonstrate how deep learning applied to acoustic data from low-cost ARUs paired with citizen science can provide valuable bird diversity data for monitoring and conservation efforts.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Erik""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: biodiversity","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoinf.2023.102065",NA,NA,NA

Bees in particular are interesting indicators as they provide a key ecosystem service in many agricultural crops. Worldwide, habitat loss and fragmentation, agricultural intensification and climate change are important drivers of plant and bee decline. Monitoring of plants and bees is a crucial first step to safeguard their diversity and the services they provide but traditional in situ methods are time consuming and expensive. Remote sensing and Earth observation have the advantages that they can cover large areas and provides repeated, spatially continuous and standardized information. However, to date it has proven challenging to use these methods to assess small-scaled species-level biodiversity components with this approach. Here we surveyed bees and flowering plants using conventional field methods in 30 grasslands along a land-use intensity gradient in the Southeast of the Netherlands. We took RGB (true colored Red-Green–Blue) images using an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) from the same fields and tested whether remote sensing can provide accurate assessments of flower cover and diversity and, by association, bee abundance and diversity. We explored the performance of different machine learning methods: Random Forest (RF), Neural Networks (NNET) and Support-Vector Machine (SVM). To evaluate the effect of the spatial resolution on the accuracy of the estimates, we tested all approaches using images at the original spatial resolution (∼ 0.5 cm) and re-sampled at 1 cm, 2 cm and 5 cm. We generally found significant relationships between UAV RGB derived estimates of flower cover and in situ estimates of flower cover and bee abundance and diversity. The highest resolution images generally resulted in the strongest relationships, with RF and NNET methods producing considerably better results than SVM methods (flower cover RF R2 = 0.8, NNET R2 = 0.79; bee abundance RF R2 = 0.65, NNET R2 = 0.54, bee species richness RF R2 = 0.62, NNET R2 = 0.52; bee species diversity RF R2 = 0.54, NNET R2 = 0.46).

Scientists, however, still often struggle to understand how landscape characteristics contribute to deliver these intangible benefits, largely because it is hard to navigate how people value nature, and because there is a lack in methods that accommodate both comprehensive and time‐efficient evaluations. Recent advances in technology and the proliferation of new data sources, such as social media data, open promising alternatives to traditional, resource‐intensive methods, facilitating the understanding of the multiple relationships between people and nature. Here, we examine a user‐friendly artificial intelligence (AI)‐based approach for inferring visual‐sensory landscape values from Flickr data, combining computer vision with text mining. We show it is possible to automatically relate photographers' preferences in capturing landscape elements to a set of CESs (aesthetic value, outdoor recreation, cultural heritage, symbolic species) with reasonable accuracy, using the semantic content provided by approximately 640,000 artificially generated tags of photographs taken in the UNESCO world heritage site ‘The Dolomites’ (Italy). We used the geographic information in the data to demonstrate that these preferences can be further linked to different natural and human variables and be used to spatially predict CES patterns. Over 90% of photograph tags could be linked to four CES categories with reasonable confidence (accuracy ration ∼ 80%). The Dolomites are highly appreciated for its aesthetic value (66% of images classified to that category) and vast cultural heritage (13%), followed by its outdoor recreation opportunities (11%) and symbolic species (10%). CES benefiting hotspots were found in areas with high tourism development and close to residential areas, and could largely be explained by a combination of environmental (e.g. landscape composition) and infrastructural (e.g. accessibility) variables. We conclude that online available AI technology and social media data can effectively be used to support rapid, flexible and transferrable CES assessments.

Descriptive ML techniques group data with little or no prior domain specific assumptions; they can generate hypotheses and automatically sort data prior to other analyses. Predictive ML techniques allow for the predictive modelling of highly non-linear systems where casual mechanisms are poorly understood, as is often the case for ES. We conducted a review to explore how ML is used in ES research and to identify and quantify trends in the different ML approaches that are used. We reviewed 308 peer-reviewed publications and identified that ES studies implemented machine learning techniques in data description (64%; n = 308) and predictive modelling (44%), with some papers containing both categories. Classification and Regression Trees were the most popular techniques (60%), but unsupervised learning techniques were also used for descriptive tasks such as clustering to group or split data without prior assumptions (19%). Whilst there are examples of ES publications that apply ML with rigour, many studies do not have robust or repeatable methods. Some studies fail to report model settings (43%) or software used (28%), and many studies do not report carrying out any form of model hyperparameter tuning (67%) or test model generalisability (59%).

We find that although the use of these tools in ecosystem service research is relatively new, it is growing quickly. Big data can directly address data gaps, especially as new big data resources relevant to ecosystem service mapping become available (ex. social media data). Some properties of machine learning can also contribute to addressing data gaps in data sparse environments. Also, many machine learning algorithms can estimate and consider uncertainty, whereas big data can significantly increase sample size, reducing uncertainties in some situations. Some big data sources, like crowdsourced data, provide direct sources of social behaviors and preferences that relate to ecosystem service demand, thus allowing researchers to connect social and biophysical aspects of ecosystem services. Machine learning algorithms provide an effective and efficient tool for handling these large nonlinear socio-ecological datasets in tandem, giving researchers the ability to more realistically model and map ecosystem services without relying on oversimplified proxies or linear algorithms. Despite these opportunities, implementation is still lacking and limitations still hinder use.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Erik""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: biodiversity","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoser.2022.101478",NA,NA,NA

Monitoring methods that can collect samples over a long period of time and independently of human influences are of particular importance. While these passive collection methods, e.g. suction traps, provide standardized and comparable data sets, the time required to analyze the large number of samples and trapped specimens is high. Another challenge is the necessary high level of taxonomic expertise required for accurate specimen processing. These factors create a bottleneck in specimen processing. In this context, machine learning, image recognition and artificial intelligence have emerged as promising tools to address the shortcomings of manual identification and quantification in the analysis of such trap catches. Aphids are important agricultural pests that pose a significant risk to several important crops and cause high economic losses through feeding damage and transmission of plant viruses. It has been shown that long-term monitoring of migrating aphids using suction traps can be used to make, adjust and improve predictions of their abundance so that the risk of plant viruses spreading through aphids can be more accurately predicted. With the increasing demand for alternatives to conventional pesticide use in crop protection, the need for predictive models is growing, e.g. as a basis for resistance development and as a measure for resistance management. In this context, advancing climate change has a strong influence on the total abundance of migrating aphids as well as on the peak occurrences of aphids within a year. Using aphids as a model organism, we demonstrate the possibilities of systematic monitoring of insect pests and the potential of future technical developments in the subsequent automated identification of individuals through to the use of case data for intelligent forecasting models. Using aphids as an example, we show the potential for systematic monitoring of insect pests through technical developments in the automated identification of individuals from static images (i.e. advances in image recognition software). We discuss the potential applications with regard to the automatic processing of insect case data and the development of intelligent prediction models.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Erik""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: biodiversity","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2023.1150748",NA,NA,NA

However, little is known about how coastal ecosystems, particularly mangroves in the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean, respond to these new ""climate normals"" at regional and subregional scales. Wind speed, rainfall, pre-cyclone forest height, and hydro-geomorphology are known to influence mangrove damage and recovery following cyclones in the NAB. However, previous studies have focused on local-scale responses and individual cyclonic events. Here, we analyze 25 years (1996-2020) of mangrove vulnerability (damage after a cyclone) and 24 years (1996-2019) of short-term resilience (recovery after damage) for the NAB and subregions, using multi-annual, remote sensing-derived databases. We used machine learning to characterize the influence of 22 potential variables on mangrove responses, including human development and long-term climate trends. Our results document variability in the rates and drivers of mangrove vulnerability and resilience, highlighting hotspots of cyclone impacts, mangrove damage, and loss of resilience. Cyclone characteristics mainly drove vulnerability at the regional level. In contrast, resilience was driven by site-specific conditions, including long-term climate trends, pre-cyclone forest structure, soil organic carbon stock, and coastal development (i.e., proximity to human infrastructure). Coastal development is associated with both vulnerability and resilience at the subregional level. Further, we highlight that loss of resilience occurs mostly in areas experiencing long-term drought across the NAB. The impacts of increasing cyclone activity on mangroves and their coastal protection service must be framed in the context of compound climate change effects and continued coastal development. Our work offers descriptive and spatial information to support the restoration and adaptive management of NAB mangroves, which need adequate health, structure, and density to protect coasts and serve as Nature-based Solutions against climate change and extreme weather events.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Erik""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: biodiversity","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.165413",NA,NA,NA

These methods tend to focus on economically significant components of forests, thus leaving out many factors vital for forest biodiversity, such as the occurrence of species with low economical but high ecological values. Airborne hyperspectral imagery has shown significant potential for tree species classification, but the most common analysis methods, such as random forest and support vector machines, require manual feature engineering in order to utilize both spatial and spectral features, whereas deep learning methods are able to extract these features from the raw data. Our research focused on the classification of the major tree species Scots pine, Norway spruce and birch, together with an ecologically valuable keystone species, European aspen, which has a sparse and scattered occurrence in boreal forests. We compared the performance of three-dimensional convolutional neural networks (3D-CNNs) with the support vector machine, random forest, gradient boosting machine and artificial neural network in individual tree species classification from hyperspectral data with high spatial and spectral resolution. We collected hyperspectral and LiDAR data along with extensive ground reference data measurements of tree species from the 83 km2 study area located in the southern boreal zone in Finland. A LiDAR-derived canopy height model was used to match ground reference data to aerial imagery. The best performing 3D-CNN, utilizing 4 m image patches, was able to achieve an F1-score of 0.91 for aspen, an overall F1-score of 0.86 and an overall accuracy of 87%, while the lowest performing 3D-CNN utilizing 10 m image patches achieved an F1-score of 0.83 and an accuracy of 85%. In comparison, the support-vector machine achieved an F1-score of 0.82 and an accuracy of 82.4% and the artificial neural network achieved an F1-score of 0.82 and an accuracy of 81.7%. Compared to the reference models, 3D-CNNs were more efficient in distinguishing coniferous species from each other, with a concurrent high accuracy for aspen classification. Deep neural networks, being black box models, hide the information about how they reach their decision. We used both occlusion and saliency maps to interpret our models. Finally, we used the best performing 3D-CNN to produce a wall-to-wall tree species map for the full study area that can later be used as a reference prediction in, for instance, tree species mapping from multispectral satellite images.

To counter these challenges, research into the use of image processing techniques for plant disease recognition has become a hot research topic. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of recent studies carried out in the area of crop pest and disease recognition using image processing and machine learning techniques. We hope that this work will be a valuable resource for researchers in this area of crop pest and disease recognition using image processing techniques. In particular, we concentrate on the use of RGB images owing to the low cost and high availability of digital RGB cameras. We report that recent efforts have focused on the use of deep learning instead of training shallow classifiers using hand-crafted features. Researchers have reported high recognition accuracies on particular datasets but in many cases, the performance of those systems deteriorated significantly when tested on different datasets or in field conditions. Nevertheless, progress made so far has been encouraging. Experimental results showing the leaf disease recognition performance of ten CNN architectures in terms of recognition accuracy, recall, precision, specificity, F1-score, training duration and storage requirements are also presented.

Therefore, it is crucial to identify key drivers and develop methods to predict cyanobacteria blooms in aquaculture water management. In this study, we analyzed monitoring data from 331 aquaculture ponds in central China and developed two machine learning models - the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression model and the random forest (RF) model - to predict cyanobacterial abundance by identifying the key drivers. Simulation results demonstrated that both machine learning models are feasible for predicting cyanobacterial abundance in aquaculture ponds. The LASSO model (R2 = 0.918, MSE = 0.354) outperformed the RF model (R2 = 0.798, MSE = 0.875) in predicting cyanobacteria abundance. Farmers with well-equipped aquaculture ponds that have abundant water monitoring data can use the nine environmental variables identified by the LASSO model as an operational solution to accurately predict cyanobacteria abundance. For crude ponds with limited monitoring data, the three environmental variables identified by the RF model provide a convenient solution for useful cyanobacteria prediction. Our findings revealed that chemical oxygen demand (COD) and total organic carbon (TOC) were the two most important predictors in both models, indicating that organic carbon concentration had a close relationship with cyanobacteria growth and should be considered a key metric in water monitoring and pond management of these aquaculture ponds. We suggest that monitoring of organic carbon coupled with phosphorus reduction in feed usage can be an effective management approach for cyanobacteria prevention and to maintain a healthy ecological state in aquaculture ponds.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Erik""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: biodiversity","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoenv.2023.114944",NA,NA,NA

The main obstacle is specimen-rich samples obtained with quantitative sampling techniques (e.g., Malaise trapping). Traditional sorting requires manual handling, while molecular techniques based on metabarcoding lose the association between individual specimens and sequences and thus struggle with obtaining precise abundance information. Here we present a sorting robot that prepares specimens from bulk samples for barcoding. It detects, images and measures individual specimens from a sample and then moves them into the wells of a 96-well microplate. We show that the images can be used to train convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that are capable of assigning the specimens to 14 insect taxa (usually families) that are particularly common in Malaise trap samples. The average assignment precision for all taxa is 91.4% (75%-100%). This ability of the robot to identify common taxa then allows for taxon-specific subsampling, because the robot can be instructed to only pick a prespecified number of specimens for abundant taxa. To obtain biomass information, the images are also used to measure specimen length and estimate body volume. We outline how the DiversityScanner can be a key component for tackling and monitoring invertebrate diversity by combining molecular and morphological tools: the images generated by the robot become training images for machine learning once they are labelled with taxonomic information from DNA barcodes.

Among various types of remote sensing data, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-acquired RGB imagery has been increasingly used for tree crown detection and crown area estimation; the method has efficient advantages and relies heavily on deep learning models. However, the approach has not been thoroughly investigated in deciduous forests with complex crown structures. In this study, we evaluated two widely used, deep-learning-based tree crown detection and delineation approaches (DeepForest and Detectree2) to assess their potential for detecting tree crowns from UAV-acquired RGB imagery in an alpine, temperate deciduous forest with a complicated species composition. A total of 499 digitized crowns, including four dominant species, with corresponding, accurate inventory data in a 1.5 ha study plot were treated as training and validation datasets. We attempted to identify an effective model to delineate tree crowns and to explore the effects of the spatial resolution on the detection performance, as well as the extracted tree crown areas, with a detailed field inventory. The results show that the two deep-learning-based models, of which Detectree2 (F1 score: 0.57) outperformed DeepForest (F1 score: 0.52), could both be transferred to predict tree crowns successfully. However, the spatial resolution had an obvious effect on the estimation accuracy of tree crown detection, especially when the resolution was greater than 0.1 m. Furthermore, Dectree2 could estimate tree crown areas accurately, highlighting its potential and robustness for tree detection and delineation. In addition, the performance of tree crown detection varied among different species. These results indicate that the evaluated approaches could efficiently delineate individual tree crowns in high-resolution optical images, while demonstrating the applicability of Detectree2, and, thus, have the potential to offer transferable strategies that can be applied to other forest ecosystems.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Erik""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: biodiversity","https://doi.org/10.3390/rs15030778",NA,NA,NA

In the context of Species Distribution Models (SDM) and in line with predictions of landscape ecology and island biogeography, CNN could grasp how local landscape structure affects prediction of species occurrence in SDMs. The prediction can thus reflect the signatures of entangled ecological processes. Although previous machine-learning based SDMs can learn complex influences of environmental predictors, they cannot acknowledge the influence of environmental structure in local landscapes (hence denoted “punctual models”). In this study, we applied CNNs to a large dataset of plant occurrences in France (GBIF), on a large taxonomical scale, to predict ranked relative probability of species (by joint learning) to any geographical position. We examined the way local environmental landscapes improve prediction by performing alternative CNN models deprived of information on landscape heterogeneity and structure (“ablation experiments”). We found that the landscape structure around location crucially contributed to improve predictive performance of CNN-SDMs. CNN models can classify the predicted distributions of many species, as other joint modelling approaches, but they further prove efficient in identifying the influence of local environmental landscapes. CNN can then represent signatures of spatially structured environmental drivers. The prediction gain is noticeable for rare species, which open promising perspectives for biodiversity monitoring and conservation strategies. Therefore, the approach is of both theoretical and practical interest. We discuss the way to test hypotheses on the patterns learnt by CNN, which should be essential for further interpretation of the ecological processes at play.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Erik""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: biodiversity","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008856",NA,NA,NA

With the advent of deep learning models, classification of important signals from these datasets has markedly improved. These models power critical data analyses for research and decision-making in biodiversity monitoring, animal behaviour studies, and natural resource management. However, deep learning models are often data-hungry and require a significant amount of labeled training data to perform well. While sufficient training data is available for certain taxonomic groups (e.g., common bird species), many classes (such as rare and endangered species, many non-bird taxa, and call-type) lack enough data to train a robust model from scratch. This study investigates the utility of feature embeddings extracted from audio classification models to identify bioacoustic classes other than the ones these models were originally trained on. We evaluate models on diverse datasets, including different bird calls and dialect types, bat calls, marine mammals calls, and amphibians calls. The embeddings extracted from the models trained on bird vocalization data consistently allowed higher quality classification than the embeddings trained on general audio datasets. The results of this study indicate that high-quality feature embeddings from large-scale acoustic bird classifiers can be harnessed for few-shot transfer learning, enabling the learning of new classes from a limited quantity of training data.

We modified an off‐the‐shelf camera trap (Bushnell™) and customised existing open‐source hardware to create a ‘smart’ camera trap system.

Machine learning can harness the power of computers to potentially create an accurate and efficient method for performing this task at scale, given that its analytical processing can be more sensitive to subtle physical differences in insects, which experts may not perceive. However, existing machine learning methods are designed to only classify insect samples into described species, thus failing to identify samples from undescribed species. We propose a novel deep hierarchical Bayesian model for insect classification, given the taxonomic hierarchy inherent in insects. This model can classify samples of both described and undescribed species; described samples are assigned a species while undescribed samples are assigned a genus, which is a pivotal advancement over just identifying them as outliers. We demonstrated this proof of concept on a new database containing paired insect image and DNA barcode data from four insect orders, including 1040 species, which far exceeds the number of species used in existing work. A quarter of the species were excluded from the training set to simulate undescribed species. With the proposed classification framework using combined image and DNA data in the model, species classification accuracy for described species was 96.66% and genus classification accuracy for undescribed species was 81.39%. Including both data sources in the model resulted in significant improvement over including image data only (39.11% accuracy for described species and 35.88% genus accuracy for undescribed species), and modest improvement over including DNA data only (73.39% genus accuracy for undescribed species). Unlike current machine learning methods, the proposed deep hierarchical Bayesian learning approach can simultaneously classify samples of both described and undescribed species, a functionality that could become instrumental in biodiversity monitoring across the globe. This framework can be customized for any taxonomic classification problem for which image and DNA data can be obtained, thus making it relevant for use across all biological kingdoms.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Erik""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: biodiversity","https://doi.org/10.1111/2041-210x.14104",NA,NA,NA

Digital mapping of SOC is challenging due to the complex relationships between the soil and its environment. Except for the well-known terrain and climate environmental covariates, vegetation that interacts with soils influences SOC significantly over long periods. Although several remote-sensing-based vegetation indices have been widely adopted in digital soil mapping, variables indicating long term vegetation growth have been less used. Vegetation phenology, an indicator of vegetation growth characteristics, can be used as a potential time series environmental covariate for SOC prediction. A CNN-LSTM model was developed for SOC prediction with inputs of static and dynamic environmental variables in Xuancheng City, China. The spatially contextual features in static variables (e.g., topographic variables) were extracted by the convolutional neural network (CNN), while the temporal features in dynamic variables (e.g., vegetation phenology over a long period of time) were extracted by a long short-term memory (LSTM) network.

Both DL and RF models obtained satisfactory accuracy on the upscaling of ICESat-2 Hcanopy assisted by Sentinel satellite co-variables with an R-value between the observed and predicted Hcanopy equalling 0.78 and 0.68, respectively. Compared to Sentinel satellites, Landsat-8 showed relatively weaker performance in Hcanopy prediction, suggesting that the addition of the backscattering coefficients from Sentinel-1 and the red-edge related variables from Sentinel-2 could positively contribute to the prediction of forest canopy height. To our knowledge, few studies have demonstrated large-scale vegetation height mapping in a resolution ≤ 250 m based on the newly available satellites (ICESat-2, Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2) and DL regression model, particularly in the forest areas in China. Thus, the present work provided a timely and important supplementary to the applications of these new earth observation tools.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Erik""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: biodiversity","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jag.2020.102163",NA,NA,NA

Here we propose deep learning (in the form of a convolutional neural network (CNN)) to classify ants at species level using AntWeb images. We used an Inception-ResNet-V2-based CNN to classify ant images, and three shot types with 10,204 images for 97 species, in addition to a multi-view approach, for training and testing the CNN while also testing a worker-only set and an AntWeb protocol-deviant test set. Top 1 accuracy reached 62% - 81%, top 3 accuracy 80% - 92%, and genus accuracy 79% - 95% on species classification for different shot type approaches. The head shot type outperformed other shot type approaches. Genus accuracy was broadly similar to top 3 accuracy. Removing reproductives from the test data improved accuracy only slightly.

Since conventional breeding technologies for crop improvement are limited, time-consuming, and involve laborious selection processes to foster new and improved crop varieties. An urgent need is to accelerate the plant breeding cycle using artificial intelligence (AI) to depict plant responses to environmental perturbations in real-time.The review is a collection of authorized information from various sources such as journals, books, book chapters, technical bulletins, conference papers, and verified online contents.Speed breeding has emerged as an essential strategy for accelerating the breeding cycles of crop plants by growing them under artificial light and temperature conditions.

Scientists have recently applied next-generation AI to delve deeper into the complex biological and molecular mechanisms that govern plant functions under environmental cues.

Therefore, recent studies are increasingly recognising passively crowdsourced geotagged photographs retrieved from location-based social media as suitable data for quantitative mapping and assessment of cultural ecosystem service (CES) flow. In this study, we attempt to improve CES mapping from geotagged photographs by combining natural language processing, i.e., topic modelling and automated machine learning classification. Our study focuses on three main groups of CESs that are abundant in outdoor social media data: landscape watching, active outdoor recreation, and wildlife watching. Moreover, by means of a comparative viewshed analysis, we compare the geographic information system- and remote sensing-based landscape organisation metrics related to landscape coherence and colour harmony. We observed the spatial distribution of CESs in Estonia and confirmed that colour harmony indices are more strongly associated with landscape watching and outdoor recreation, while landscape coherence is more associated with wildlife watching. Both CES use and values of landscape organisation indices are land cover-specific. The suggested methodology can significantly improve the state-of-the-art with regard to CES mapping from geotagged photographs, and it is therefore particularly relevant for monitoring landscape sustainability.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Erik""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: biodiversity","https://doi.org/10.3390/land9050158",NA,NA,NA

While real‐time and automated monitoring of abiotic components has been possible for some time, monitoring biotic components—for example, individual behaviours and traits, and species abundance and distribution—is far more challenging. Recent technological advancements offer potential solutions to achieve this through: (i) increasingly affordable high‐throughput recording hardware, which can collect rich multidimensional data, and (ii) increasingly accessible artificial intelligence approaches, which can extract ecological knowledge from large datasets. However, automating the monitoring of facets of ecological communities via such technologies has primarily been achieved at low spatiotemporal resolutions within limited steps of the monitoring workflow. Here, we review existing technologies for data recording and processing that enable automated monitoring of ecological communities. We then present novel frameworks that combine such technologies, forming fully automated pipelines to detect, track, classify and count multiple species, and record behavioural and morphological traits, at resolutions which have previously been impossible to achieve.

Exploring the genomic basis of local adaptation is imperative for assessing the conditions under which trees will successfully adapt in situ to global climate change. However, this knowledge has scarcely been used in conservation and forest tree improvement because woody perennials face major research limitations such as their outcrossing reproductive systems, long juvenile phase, and huge genome sizes. Therefore, in this review we discuss predictive genomic approaches that promise increasing selection accuracy and shortening generation intervals. They may also assist the detection of novel allelic variants from tree germplasm, and disclose the genomic potential of adaptation to different environments. For instance, natural populations of tree species allow using tools from the population genomics field to study the signatures of local adaptation. Conventional genetic markers and whole genome sequencing both help identifying genes and markers that diverge between local populations more than expected under neutrality, and that exhibit unique signatures of diversity indicative of 'selective sweeps'. Ultimately, these efforts inform the conservation and breeding status capable of pivoting forest health, ecosystem services, and sustainable production. Key long-term perspectives include understanding how trees' phylogeographic history may affect the adaptive relevant genetic variation available for adaptation to environmental change.

Although multi-temporal remote sensing offers unique capability to monitor S. alterniflora over large areas and long time periods, three major hurdle exist: (1) in the coastal zone where S. alterniflora occupies, frequent cloud coverage reduces the number of available images that can be used; (2) prominent spectral variations exist within the S. alterniflora due to phonological variations; (3) poor spectral separability between S. alterniflora and its co-dominant native species is often presented in the territories where S. alterniflora intruded in. To articulate these questions, we proposed a new pixel-based phenological feature composite method (Ppf-CM) based on Google Earth Engine. The Ppf-CM method was brainstormed to battle the aforementioned three hurdles as the basic unit for extracting phonological feature is individual pixel in lieu of an entire image scene.

Tools are needed to automatically extract useful information from the ever‐growing corpus of ecological texts and feed this information to open data repositories. A prerequisite is the ability to recognise mentions of taxa in text, a special case of named entity recognition (NER). In recent years, deep learning‐based NER systems have become ubiquitous, yielding state‐of‐the‐art results in the general and biomedical domains. However, no such tool is available to ecologists wishing to extract information from the biodiversity literature. We propose a new tool called TaxoNERD that provides deep neural network (DNN) models to recognise taxon mentions in ecological documents. To achieve high performance, these models usually need to be trained on a large corpus of manually annotated text. Creating such a corpus is a laborious and costly process, with the result that manually annotated corpora in the ecological domain tend to be too small to learn an accurate DNN model from scratch. To address this issue, we leverage existing models pretrained on large biomedical corpora using transfer learning. The performance of our models is evaluated on four corpora and compared to the most popular taxonomic entity recognition tools. Our experiments suggest that existing taxonomic NER tools are not suited to the extraction of ecological information from text as they performed poorly on ecologically oriented corpora, either because they do not take account of the variability of taxon naming practices or because they do not generalise well to the ecological domain. Conversely, a domain‐specific DNN‐based tool like TaxoNERD outperformed the other approaches on an ecological information extraction task. Efforts are needed to raise ecological information extraction to the same level of performance as its biomedical counterpart. One promising direction is to leverage the huge corpus of unlabelled ecological texts to learn a language representation model that could benefit downstream tasks.

However, very bitter compounds may be more cardiotoxic than not very bitter compounds, possessing significantly lower QPlogHERG values.

Diverse data collected on the biology and ecology of Collembola over the last century are waiting for synthesis studies, while developing technologies may facilitate generation of new knowledge. Collembola research in 2020 is entering the stage of global synthesis and in this opinion paper we address the main challenges that the community of collembologists is facing on this avenue. We first discuss the present status and social context of Collembola taxonomy and the potential use of novel technologies to describe new species. We then focus on aspects of community ecology, reviewing the processes of dispersal, environmental and biotic filtering, from the spatial scale of microhabitat to the globe. We also discuss the involvement of Collembola in ecosystem processes and which proxies, such as functional traits, can be used to predict the functional roles of species. Finally, we provide recommendations on how we can improve community data collection by using standard methods and better data handling practices. We call for (1) integrating morphological descriptions with high-resolution photographs and genetic barcodes for species descriptions and developing of user friendly software and machine learning approaches to facilitate deposition of structured taxonomic knowledge on web platforms; (2) multiscale studies on biodiversity distribution and community processes, especially including dispersal mechanisms; (3) recording and sharing functional, not only morphological, trait data in controlled experiments and field surveys; (4) knowledge synthesis and meta-analysis studies on the topics of ecosystem roles of Collembola, conservation of its diversity, feeding behaviour, protection mechanisms and dispersal of different Collembola species, and effects of land use and climate change on collembolan communities; (5) joint efforts in covering the gaps in Collembola knowledge, especially in underexplored regions (predominantly tropics and subtropics) using standard methodologies; (6) data sharing and its integration in open structured databases. We believe that Collembola studies could make use of new technologies and ongoing changes in society. To facilitate the progress across these research topics by 2040, we have established #GlobalCollembola, a distributed-effort community-driven initiative that aims to provide open and global data on Collembola taxonomic and genetic diversity, abundance, traits and literature and to coordinate global efforts in covering the key knowledge gaps.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Erik""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: biodiversity","https://doi.org/10.25674/so92iss3pp161",NA,NA,NA

On the other hand, for several centuries, botanists have systematically collected, catalogued and stored plant specimens in herbaria, especially in tropical regions, and recent efforts by the biodiversity informatics community have made it possible to put millions of digitised records online. The LifeCLEF 2021 plant identification challenge (or PlantCLEF 2021) was designed to assess the extent to which automated identification of flora in data-poor regions can be improved by using herbarium collections. It is based on a dataset of about 1,000 species mainly focused on the Guiana Shield of South America, a region known to have one of the highest plant diversities in the world. The challenge was evaluated as a cross-domain classification task where the training set consisted of several hundred thousand herbarium sheets and a few thousand photos to allow learning a correspondence between the two domains. In addition to the usual metadata (location, date, author, taxonomy), the training data also includes the values of 5 morphological and functional traits for each species.

Automatic bird vocalization recognition technology has advanced from classical pattern recognition to deep learning (DL), with significantly improved recognition performance. This paper reviews related works on DL-based automatic bird vocalization recognition technology in the last decade. In this review, we present the current state of research in the three key areas of pre-processing, feature extraction and recognition methods involved in automatic bird vocalization recognition. The related datasets, evaluation metrics and software are also summarized. Finally, existing challenges along with opportunities for future work are highlighted. We conclude that, while DL-based automatic bird vocalization recognition has made recent advances in specific species, more robust denoising approaches, larger public datasets, and stronger generalization capabilities of feature extraction and recognition are required to achieve reliable and general bird recognition in the wild. We expect that this review will serve as a firm foundation for new researchers working in the field of DL-based automatic bird vocalization recognition technologies, as well as become an insightful guide for computer science and ecology experts.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Erik""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: biodiversity","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoinf.2022.101927",NA,NA,NA

Process-based weed dynamics models are valuable tools to investigate this issue. Indeed, (1) weeds are the most harmful pest in arable crops and are essential for biodiversity, and (2) the processes driving crop-weed interactions are similar to those for crop-crop interactions in crop mixtures and crop rotations. Such models (3) synthesize existing and produce emergent knowledge on agroecological levers such as crop diversification, (4) mobilize this knowledge for cropping-system design, and (5) transfer research-based knowledge to stakeholders. The present paper illustrates these five items with the FLORSYS model. Its inputs are a detailed list of cultural operations over several years (crop succession including cover crops and crop mixtures, management techniques), together with daily weather data, soil characteristics and a regional weed species pool. FLORSYS runs at a daily time step, (1) focusing on processes leading to plant emergence and establishment of crop and weed species with different ecological requirements (essential for crops sown in different seasons and in mixtures where timing often determines the fate of a species), (2) representing and modelling the functioning of heterogeneous crop-weed canopies including diverse plant ages, morphologies and shade responses (as in crop mixtures), (3) including a carry-over effect on future cropping seasons (which is essential for crop rotations), and (4) assessing weed contribution to biodiversity. Detailed biophysical model outputs allow understanding the performance of a given crop, management technique or cropping system. Together with stakeholders, detailed model outputs were aggregated into indicators of crop production as well as weed benefits and harmfulness to simplify the multicriteria comparison of cropping systems. To facilitate decision support, FLORSYS was used as a virtual farm-field network, and the resulting simulation outputs were aggregated into a faster and easier-to-use metamodel (DECIFLORSYS) using machine learning techniques. These models were used to evaluate and promote the benefits of crop diversification for agroecological weed management, by (1) identifying crop ideotypes, (2) tracking crop-diverse solutions in farm-field networks, (3) evaluating crop-diverse solutions proposed by experts and stakeholders, and (4) feeding participatory workshops with farmers. The case studies demonstrate that the benefits of crop diversification depend on the production situations and cropping systems, and thus the need for flexible rules on crop diversification and the usefulness of models such as FLORSYS to establish these rules.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Erik""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: biodiversity","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fcr.2020.108006",NA,NA,NA

In this paper, we present a framework to use drone imagery to calculate correction factors which can improve the accuracy of satellite-based mangrove extent. We focus on semi-arid dwarf mangroves of Baja California Sur, Mexico, where the mangroves tend to be stunted in height and found in small patches, as well as larger forests. Using a DJI Phantom 4 Pro, we imaged mangroves and labeled the extent by manual classification in QGIS. Using ArcGIS, we compared satellite-based mangrove extent maps from Global Mangrove Watch (GMW) in 2016 and Mexico’s national government agency (National Commission for the Knowledge and Use of Biodiversity, CONABIO) in 2015, with extent maps generated from in situ drone studies in 2018 and 2019. We found that satellite-based extent maps generally overestimated mangrove coverage compared to that of drone-based maps. To correct this overestimation, we developed a method to derive correction factors for GMW mangrove extent. These correction factors correspond to specific pixel patterns generated from a convolution analysis and mangrove coverage defined from drone imagery. We validated our model by using repeated k-fold cross-validation, producing an accuracy of 98.3% ± 2.1%. Overall, drones and satellites are complementary tools, and the rise of machine learning can help stakeholders further leverage the strengths of the two tools, to better monitor mangroves for local, national, and international management.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Erik""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: biodiversity","https://doi.org/10.3390/rs12233986",NA,NA,NA

To this end, a systems-based approach that is composed of two core components: a monitoring system and a modelling system are put forward with honey bees taken as a showcase. Key developments in the current scientific opinion (including systematic data collection from sentinel beehives and an agent-based simulation) have the potential to substantially contribute to future development of environmental risk assessments of multiple stressors at larger spatial and temporal scales. For the monitoring, sentinel hives would be placed across representative climatic zones and landscapes in the EU and connected to a platform for data storage and analysis. Data on bee health status, chemical residues and the immediate or broader landscape around the hives would be collected in a harmonised and standardised manner, and would be used to inform stakeholders, and the modelling system, ApisRAM, which simulates as accurately as possible a honey bee colony. ApisRAM would be calibrated and continuously updated with incoming monitoring data and emerging scientific knowledge from research. It will be a supportive tool for beekeeping, farming, research, risk assessment and risk management, and it will benefit the wider society. A societal outlook on the proposed approach is included and this was conducted with targeted social science research with 64 beekeepers from eight EU Member States and with members of the EU Bee Partnership. Gaps and opportunities are identified to further implement the approach. Conclusions and recommendations are made on a way forward, both for the application of the approach and its use in a broader context. Summary The introduction of this scientific opinion clarifies the background and Terms of Reference of this mandate (Section 1.1), but also provides background information on the MUST-B project (‘EU efforts towards a holistic and integrated risk assessment approach of multiple stressors in bees’) and the EU Bee Partnership that are referred to in the mandate (Section 1.2 and Table 1) as well as to specific EU projects that are supporting MUST-B (Appendix A). The Coordinators of the ENVI committee of the European Parliament endorsed a request for a scientific opinion by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) on the science behind the development of an integrated holistic approach for the risk assessment of multiple stressors in managed honey bees (Apis mellifera). This request is composed of four Terms of Reference. Three of them are focused on the development of a methodology that takes into account multiple stressors including single or multiple chemicals (i.e. coming from the environment, whether regulated or not; see Appendix B for clarifications of the terminology) and their various types of effects on bees (i.e. additive, synergistic, acute, chronic and sublethal). This development needs to include the work carried out by MUST-B and the EFSA Scientific Panels. The last term of reference is on the EU Bee Partnership and the guidance needed for harmonised data collection. The MUST-B project is a multidisciplinary and multi-annual scientific project that was initiated as a self-task of the EFSA Scientific Committee and Emerging Risks Unit (Section 1.2.1). MUST-B is composed of a task force represented by several units from ESFA's Scientific and Communication departments, four working groups (from the Scientific Committee and Emerging Risks Unit, the Animal Health and Welfare Unit, the Pesticides Unit and the Communication Unit), a discussion group of stakeholders called the ‘EU Bee Partnership’ (composed of representative stakeholders) and several outsourcing activities (i.e. risk factors analysis on EPILOBEE data set; chemical mixtures risk assessment in managed and wild bees; modelling development for an agent-based honey bee colony model; field data collection to calibrate the honey bee colony model; and development of a prototype platform for the EU Bee Partnership to collect and exchange standardised data on bee health and beekeeping). Ongoing research projects such as ‘PoshBee’ and ‘B-GOOD’ from Horizon 2020 support specifically the MUST-B project and other EU-funded projects such as ‘INSIGNIA’, ‘IoBee’ and ‘SAMS’ that are relevant to MUST-B. Further description on these research projects is detailed in Appendix A. Data play a central role in MUST-B, and the FAIR principles (findability, accessibility, interoperability, reusability) are very relevant. In addition, MUST-B promotes data quality, reliability, openness and transparency, and supports stakeholder engagement to increase trust and evidence-based risk assessment (Section 1.2.2). A willingness to increase trust is demonstrated by the shared goal of the EU Bee Partnership on the collection and sharing of harmonised data on bee health and beekeeping in Europe (Section 1.2.2). The request from the European Parliament and the EFSA MUST-B project fit into the actions and measures that were outlined in the European Green Deal for the European Union and its citizens. These specifically seek to make the EU's economy sustainable by supporting Member States to improve and restore damaged ecosystems, by promoting an environment that is free from pollution including multiple pollutants such as chemicals, by reducing the use and risk of chemical pesticides and by promoting data access and interoperability with the support of artificial intelligence and digitalisation (see Section 1.2.3). In the interpretations of the Terms of Reference (Section 1.3), it is clarified that this scientific opinion presents ideas and concepts for consideration and future development. This opinion is aligned to aspirations outlined in the EU Green Deal and the prospective EFSA strategy 2027, presenting ideas and facilitating discussion, leading to practical solutions, in this critical area of environmental risk assessment of multiple stressors in honey bees. Further clarification of the terminologies used in the mandate and in this opinion is provided in Appendix B. To contextualise the need for the development of a holistic and integrated environmental risk assessment approach for honey bees suffering exposure to multiple stressors, two overviews are provided in Section 2. The first one on the regulatory background of the current framework for the environmental risk assessment of plant protection products (Section 2.1) and the second on the environmental risk assessment of multiple stressors in honey bees (Section 2.2.1) with insights into the challenges met (Section 2.2.2). Those challenges are linked to the complexity of a honey bee colony (Section 2.2.2.1 and Appendix C) and to the landscape in which colonies are located (Section 2.2.2.2). The proposed holistic and integrated environmental risk-assessment approach for honey bees is based on a ‘systems-based approach’ (Section 3.1), which has two core components linked by data flows (modelling and monitoring) and that is further developed in this scientific opinion (Section 3.2). The modelling system is based on the development of ApisRAM, the agent-based simulation model that EFSA has outsourced to assess either a single or two chemicals, including plant protection products, in interaction with other stressors such as biological agents (Varroa, Nosema, deformed wing virus and acute bee paralysis virus), beekeeping management practices and environmental factors relevant to the colony, including weather and floral resources (Section 3.2.1). This agent-based simulation was formalised by the MUST-B working group to address some shortcomings identified by EFSA when evaluating the usefulness of BEEHAVE as a regulatory tool (Section 3.2.1.1). ApisRAM is built in ALMaSS (an Animal, Landscape and Man Simulation System) with landscapes being simulated in substantial spatial detail (10 × 10 km area at a resolution of 1 m2) (Section 3.2.1.2). ApisRAM integrates multiple stressors (Section 3.2.1.3) and will also include sublethal effects such as reproductive performance of queens, development of hypopharyngeal glands and homing ability (Section 3.2.1.4). Any future development of ApisRAM will include the possibility to assess multiple chemicals (i.e. more than two compounds) and several other additional features, including several colonies, additional biological agents such as predators, nutrition quality and interaction with other stressors (see Section 3.2.1.5). Regarding the monitoring system of the systems-based approach, it will be composed of a network of sentinel hives located in various regions of Europe and connected to a platform for data storage and analysis (Section 3.2.2). Data will be collected to inform ApisRAM on the status of the honey bee colony. This will be defined by the HEALTHY-B toolbox and indicators (Section 3.2.2.1 and Appendix D for a description of the (digital) tools to assess honey bee colony status). Additional data will be collected on exposure to chemical residues both inside and outside the sentinel hives (Section 3.2.2.2), and about the structure, management and dynamics of the landscapes, including around sentinel beehives (Section 3.2.2.3). The systems-based approach would have applications in, and potential benefit to, beekeeping, farming, research, risk assessment, risk management and the broader society (NGOs, Industry and EU citizens) (Section 4). As a tool for risk assessment and risk management, each of the following attributes is relevant: holistic, protective, integrative, adaptive, responsive, inclusionary, transparent and by being effectively communicated (Section 4.3). A societal outlook on the systems-based approach is included to understand and integrate the views of beekeepers and stakeholders (Section 5 and Appendices E and F). Targeted research was conducted with beekeepers in selected EU countries to assess their views on the proposed approach, their needs and expectations in terms of data for managing their colonies, digital advancements and requirements for communication of applied research. Several stakeholders could interact with the system, including the members of the EU Bee Partnership, to promote accessible and reliable data collection and management. This systems-based approach could contribute to risk assessment of bee health that is more open, transparent and trustworthy, contributing to the long-term prosperity of honey bee colonies and beekeeping in Europe (Section 5.1 and Appendix E). This work addresses the first term of reference of the mandate on the inclusion of beekeeping management practices in the development of a holistic risk assessment approach. In addition, interviews were conducted with members of the EU Bee Partnership to determine their perceived involvement and collaboration, the efficiency of the partnership, their views on harmonised data collection and sharing as well as the future involvement of new partners and the wider community of beekeepers (resources and coordination) (Section 5.2 and Appendix F). This work is aligned to the Term of Reference on the need for guidance to the EU Bee Partnership on harmonised data collection and sharing in bee health and beekeeping in Europe. This work was also published as a standalone report, providing more details on the material, methodologies and results (EFSA, 2021). The scientific opinion identified gaps and opportunities for the implementation of the systems-based approach (Section 6). These related to environmental risk assessment, including the risk assessment of combined exposure to chemical mixtures (Section 6.1), the systems-based approach (Section 6.2) comprising the modelling and monitoring (Section 6.2.1) and data flows into the systems-based approach (Section 6.2.2). Finally, conclusions and recommendations are made (Section 7). The importance of the socio-political context (EU Green Deal) of this work was highlighted, as was the support of social sciences in facilitating exchanges with stakeholders in this opinion. This work goes beyond the ‘one substance approach’ by adopting a ‘systems-based approach for a holistic and integrated risk assessment of multiple stressors’. The opinion highlights the importance of data in the systems-based approach, and the spectrum of beneficiaries and players (Section 7.1). It was recommended that a systems-based approach be introduced on a phased basis, seeking a more holistic and integrated environmental risk assessment of multiple stressors in honey bees. That is, from the simpler assessment of single substances through to the more complex assessment of multiple chemicals, landscape and indirect effects. Additional recommendations highlight the need for a more systematic inclusion of social sciences in EFSA's risk assessments to take into account stakeholders’ perspectives and make more fit-for-purpose risk assessments; the development of a Pan-EU data collection effort through the sentinel hive network; the establishment of specific indicators of the health status of a honey bee colony, including the fine tuning of appropriate tools; and research investigations to fill the gaps in environmental risk assessment, model testing and data harmonisation. It is recommended that the systems-based approach reports relevant information in a manner that gives EU citizens a better understanding of the possible causes and underlying mechanisms of bee health decline in Europe and worldwide. The proposed approach developed in this opinion on honey bees as a showcase could be used more broadly to advance environmental risk assessments (i.e. on other bee types, non-target arthropods and other terrestrial or aquatic organisms) (Section 7.2). 1 Introduction 1.1 Background and Terms of Reference as provided by the European Parliament On 28 June 2018, the Coordinators of the ENVI committee endorsed a request for a scientific opinion by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) on the science behind the development of an integrated and holistic approach for the risk assessment of multiple stressors in managed honey bees (Apis mellifera). This request was submitted in accordance with Article 29 of Regulation (EC) No 178/200211 Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28 January 2002 laying down the general principles and requirements of food law, establishing the European Food Safety Authority and laying down procedures in matters of food safety. OJ L 31, 1.2.2002, pp. 1–24. on ‘laying down the general principles and requirements of food law, setting up the European Food Safety Authority and laying down procedures in matters of food safety’, which provides that the European Parliament may request the Authority to issue a scientific opinion on matters falling within the Authority's mission. The request was introduced taking into account the world-wide importance of bees and pollinators, as 84% of plant species and 76% of Europe's food production depend on pollination by bees and this represents an estimated economic value of EUR14.2 billion a year. However, the health of honey bee colonies has been declining and there have been intensive scientific efforts to better understand the reasons for this decline, which may be related to intensive agriculture and pesticides use, poor bee nutrition, viruses and attacks by invasive species, as well as environmental changes and habitat loss. The ENVI committee, therefore, considered it opportune for Parliament to request that EFSA deliver a scientific opinion on the science behind the development of an integrated and holistic approach for the risk assessment of multiple stressors in managed honey bees (Apis mellifera). The following issues have been identified for the development of a scientific opinion on the risk assessment of multiple stressors from both the in-hive environment and the surrounding landscape: The development of a methodology to take into account not only cumulative and synergistic effects of plant protection products (PPPs) but also include issues related to bees’ genetic variety, bee pathogens, bee management practices and the colony environment (Term of Reference ToR 1). The assessment of acute and chronic effects of multiple stressors on honey bees including colony survival and sublethal effects (Term of Reference ToR 2). The work being developed by stakeholders to achieve harmonised data collection and sharing on bee health in EU and, by doing so, support the EU Bee Partnership initiative by providing guidance for harmonised data collection and evidence-based risk assessments (Term of Reference ToR 3). The work conducted by EFSA under its project MUST-B that integrates the work being developed in EFSA's various panels (Term of Reference ToR 4). This scientific opinion, to be delivered by June 2021, should integrate efforts already conducted and propose a framework for risk assessment that can ensure the protection of managed honey bees in Europe. 1.2 The MUST-B project 1.2.1 Activities within EFSA Honey bee colony health decline finds its origin in a complex socioecological system. It can be considered as a multifactorial and multistakeholder issue given the number of factors and stressors that affect honey bee colony health, and the number of stakeholders who are involved. However, the current risk assessment approaches remain compartmentalised and intradisciplinary, and more holistic, multidisciplinary and integrated approaches are required to resolve such complexity. At EFSA, a multidisciplinary task force was set up to move towards the development of such a transversal and holistic approach for the risk assessment of multiple stressors in bees. The task force published a review of the work carried out on bee health by EFSA, the European Member States (MS) and the European Commission (EFSA, 2012, 2014a). The task force highlighted knowledge gaps and research needs that would assist the development of a harmonised environmental risk assessment scheme for bees. This work was further discussed with stakeholders (EFSA, 2013a) and the European Commission (EFSA and European Commission Directorate-General for Agriculture and Rural Development, 2016) to support EFSA's efforts to develop a holistic risk assessment for bees and to determine research priorities on bee health under the H2020 framework. In this context, two EU research calls were launched and granted in 2018 and 2019. The first project, ‘PoshBee’ (‘Pan-European assessment, monitoring and mitigation of stressors on the health of bees’) (Appendix A), should prove useful for the further implementation of this holistic risk assessment approach by gathering more evidence on exposure and risk characterisation of multiple chemicals for bee health, taking into account interactions with other stressors and factors in the environment of bees, such as biological stressors, nutrition and the broader environment (weather, climate and landscape characteristics). Within this project, it is intended to gather data on lethal, chronic and sublethal effects including toxicokinetics and toxicodynamics, full dose relationships and to develop new protocols and markers based on ‘omics (transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics) of chemical and biological stressors exposure/effects to be used in monitoring plans. The second project, ‘B-GOOD’ (‘Giving beekeeping guidance by computational-assisted decision making’) (Appendix A), focuses on the development of ready-to-use tools for operationalising the ‘health status index’ developed by EFSA (EFSA AHAW Panel, 2016) to enable data collection and return to beekeepers, while exploring various socioeconomic and ecological factors beyond bee health. Within this project, the plan is to create an EU platform to collect and share knowledge, science and practice related to honey bees, their environment and agricultural and beekeeping practices. The ultimate project goal is to validate technologies for monitoring colonies and indicators of bee health in an automated or semi-automated way to facilitate standardised and accurate data collection and transfer. In addition to these two research projects that specifically refer to MUST-B, there is a third project that was initiated in 2018 called ‘INSIGNIA’ (‘A citizen science protocol for honey bee colony as bio-sampler for pesticides’) which is building on the knowledge gained from the COLOSS Citizen Scientist Initiative (CSI) – Pollen project. This citizen science project (using beekeepers) will provide innovative methods to sample and analyse pesticides residues and botanical origin of the pollen brought back by foragers to the colony and determine pesticides exposure across various landscapes in EU (Appendix A). In parallel with the above research, which will generate data, tools and methodologies supporting EFSA's initial work in bee health, EFSA initiated a large 5-year project in 2015 called ‘MUST-B’ (‘EU efforts towards a holistic and integrated risk assessment approach of multiple stressors in bees’) to move further towards the development of a more holistic and integrated approach to the risk assessment of multiple stressors in bees, focusing to start with on honey bees. MUST-B was rooted in EFSA's strategic objectives 2020 (EFSA, 2015), in particular on the prioritisation of public and stakeholder engagement in the process of scientific assessment, on the widening of EFSA's evidence base, on the optimisation of access to its data and on preparing for future risk assessment challenges. MUST-B focuses on three pillars: (i) the development of tools and methodologies for the risk assessment of multiple stressors in bees at the landscape level, (ii) gathering robust data (i.e. harmonised and standardised) for evidence-based risk assessment of bee health and (iii) the engagement of stakeholders for harmonised data collection and data sharing in EU on bee health. The MUST-B working group has developed a framework incorporating modelling, experimental and field-monitoring approaches. These complementary approaches are being combined to extrapolate risks from individual to colony levels, to assess the complexity of co-exposures from multiple stressors coming from both the hive environment and the landscape and to determine their relative contribution to colony losses and weakening. Modelling is at the core of the MUST-B framework with the development of a predictive agent-based simulation of a honey bee colony, ‘ApisRAM’, in real Geographic Information System (GIS) landscapes and that is currently outsourced by EFSA. This computer simulation is being developed as a quantitative tool for regulatory risk-assessment purposes and as a predictive and explanatory tool to better understand the (relative) risks and impacts of multiple stressors on honey bee colonies, including the overall complexity of interactions. The conceptual model (a qualitative description of the system to be modelled, including insights into the environmental and biological processes and their interactions and interdependencies) was defined by a group of experts, the MUST-B working group (EFSA, 2016a,b), who took account of recommendations on the usefulness and suitability of an existing model, BEEHAVE (Becher et al., 2014), for use in a regulatory context (EFSA PPR Panel, 2015). The working group followed the EFSA scientific opinion on good modelling practices for model development and testing (EFSA PPR Panel, 2014). Criteria, derived based on minimum requirements, were described to design a field data collection to be conducted in the three EU regulatory zones to validate and calibrate the model as a regulatory tool for the risk assessment of PPPs in interaction with other stressors and factors such as biological stressors (Varroa destructor, Nosema spp. and their associated viruses, deformed wing virus (DWV) and acute bee paralysis virus (ABPV)), resources in the landscape, beekeeping management practices and weather conditions, on honey bee colonies (EFSA, 2017a,b). This is further described in Section 4.2. EFSA outsourced the data collection in two EU MS, Denmark and Portugal (validating two EU zones, the north and the south). When designing the field data collection, the working group took into account lessons learnt from the EPILOBEE project","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Erik""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: biodiversity | USER-NOTES: {""Maria""=>[""The European Parliament requested EFSA to develop a holistic risk assessment of multiple stressors in honey bees. To this end, a systems-based approach that is composed of two core components: a monitoring system and a modelling system are put forward with honey bees taken as a showcase. Key developments in the current scientific opinion (including systematic data collection from sentinel beehives and an agent-based simulation) have the potential to substantially contribute to future development of environmental risk assessments of multiple stressors at larger spatial and temporal scales. For the monitoring, sentinel hives would be placed across representative climatic zones and landscapes in the EU and connected to a platform for data storage and analysis. "", ""Data on bee health status, chemical residues and the immediate or broader landscape around the hives would be collected in a harmonised and standardised manner, and would be used to inform stakeholders, and the modelling system, ApisRAM, which simulates as accurately as possible a honey bee colony. ApisRAM would be calibrated and continuously updated with incoming monitoring data and emerging scientific knowledge from research. It will be a supportive tool for beekeeping, farming, research, risk assessment and risk management, and it will benefit the wider society. A societal outlook on the proposed approach is included and this was conducted with targeted social science research with 64 beekeepers from eight EU Member States and with members of the EU Bee Partnership. Gaps and opportunities are identified to further implement the approach. Conclusions and recommendations are made on a way forward, both for the application of the approach and its use in a broader context.""]}","https://doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2021.6607",NA,NA,NA
