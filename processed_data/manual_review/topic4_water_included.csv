This paper highlights the major constraints to agricultural productivity, traditional irrigation scheduling methods, and associated challenges, efforts, and progress to enhance water use efficiency (WUE), conserve water, and guarantee food security by overviewing different smart irrigation approaches. Widely used traditional irrigation scheduling methods (based on weather, plant, and soil moisture conditions) usually lack important information needed for precise irrigation, which leads to over- or under-irrigation of fields. On the other hand, by using several factors, including soil and climate variation, soil properties, plant responses to water deficits, and changes in weather factors, smart irrigation can drive better irrigation decisions that can help save water and increase yields. Various smart irrigation approaches, such as artificial intelligence and deep learning (artificial neural network, fuzzy logic, expert system, hybrid intelligent system, and deep learning), model predictive irrigation systems, variable rate irrigation (VRI) technology, and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) could ensure high water use efficiency in water-scarce regions.

Time-frequency images of environmental drivers generated by wavelets may provide crucial signals for modelling of HCBs to be recognized by CNNs. This study applies CNNs for time-series modelling of HCBs of Microcystis sp. in four South Korean rivers between 2016 and 2022 by means of time-frequency images of environmental drivers within the lead time of HCBs. After estimating the cardinal dates of beginning, peak, and ending of HCBs, wavelet analysis identified key drivers by phase analysis and generated time-frequency images of the drivers within the cardinal dates for 3, 4 and 5 years. Performances of CNNs were compared in terms of four determinants of input images: methods of estimating critical timings, the number of segments, time-series continuity, and image size. The resulting CNNs predicted high or low intensities of HCBs with a mean accuracy of 97.79 ± 0.06% and F1-score 97.49 ± 0.06% for training dataset, and a mean accuracy of 95.01 ± 0.06% and F1-score 93.30 ± 0.07% for testing dataset.

The FSM firstly identifies a sequence of missing values and replaces them with some constant values to create a dummy complete sequence.

Denmark has a long history of carrying out soil assessments − originally in order to determine tax revenues for the king, and, more recently, for aiding policymakers and farmers. This knowledge has supported the development of intensive agricultural systems while maintaining the provision of ecosystem services (e.g., clean water). Getting an overview of historical soil surveys and pedological mapping approaches can generate useful information for mapping soil, identifying gaps and proposing directions for future research. In this review, we explore the evolution of soil and environmental inventories, the historical development of soil mapping methods, and how these factors contributed to a better spatial understanding of soil functions. Specifically, we discuss soil functions related to water regulation (e.g., drainage, groundwater and water surface interactions, water table), water filtering (e.g., nitrogen leaching), carbon sequestration (e.g., peatlands), agricultural production (e.g., land suitability, wheat yields), and threats related to soil degradation (e.g., soil erosion). Denmark has benefitted from a government-coordinated approach, promoting detailed and systematic national soil surveys and environmental monitoring programmes. The large databases produced in the surveys formed the basis for mapping several soil properties and functions at increasingly high resolutions over the last many years based on developments in machine learning. In contrast to methodological advances in soil mapping and relevant contributions to pedometric research, we identified a lack of spatial information on soil biodiversity. Detailed spatial information about soil functions is essential to address global issues, such as climate change, food security and water security, and the experience of mapping soil functions in Denmark can be a source of inspiration to other parts of the world.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Erik""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: water","https://doi.org/10.3389/fsoil.2023.1090145",NA,NA,NA

Timely and accurate estimation of reference evapotranspiration (ET0) is indispensable for agricultural water management for efficient water use. This study aims to estimate the amount of ET0 with machine learning approaches by using minimum meteorological parameters in the Corum region, which has an arid and semi-arid climate and is regarded as an important agricultural centre of Turkey. In this context, monthly averages of meteorological variables, i.e. maximum and minimum temperature; sunshine duration; wind speed; and average, maximum, and minimum relative humidity, are used as inputs. Two different kernel-based methods, i.e. Gaussian process regression (GPR) and support vector regression (SVR), together with a Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno artificial neural network (BFGS-ANN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) models were used to estimate ET0 amounts in 10 different combinations. The results showed that all four methods predicted ET0 amounts with acceptable accuracy and error levels. The BFGS-ANN model showed higher success (R2=0.9781) than the others. In kernel-based GPR and SVR methods, the Pearson VII function-based universal kernel was the most successful (R2=0.9771). Scenario 5, with temperatures including average temperature, maximum and minimum temperature, and sunshine duration as inputs, gave the best results. The second best scenario had only the sunshine duration as the input to the BFGS-ANN, which estimated ET0 having a correlation coefficient of 0.971 (Scenario 8). Conclusively, this study shows the better efficacy of the BFGS in ANNs for enhanced performance of the ANN model in ET0 estimation for drought-prone arid and semi-arid regions.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Erik""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: water","https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-25-603-2021",NA,NA,NA

Rainfall-runoff simulation approaches range between physical, conceptual, and data-driven models. With the recent development of machine-learning techniques, machine learning methods have been widely applied in the field of hydrology. Existing studies show that such methods can achieve comparable or even better performances than conventional hydrological models in runoff simulation. In particular, long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks are able to overcome the shortcomings of traditional neural network methods in handling time series data. However, the impacts of the time memory on rainfall-runoff simulation are rarely studied. In this study, hysteresis effects in hydrology were investigated and the performances of machine learning methods and traditional hydrological models were assessed. The results show that the ANN model is more suitable for monthly scale simulation, while the LSTM model performs better at daily scale. Hydrological hysteresis is important for runoff simulations when using machine learning methods, especially at daily scale. By considering hysteresis in the simulation, the RMSE is significantly improved by 27% (21%) for LSTM (ANN). In addition, LSTM is more robust for time series handling, while the ANN is easier to be overfitted due to the limitation of neural network structure.

"rayyan-100677449","RainNet v1.0: a convolutional neural network for radar-based precipitation nowcasting",NA,1,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"en",NA,NA,"Abstract. In this study, we present RainNet, a deep convolutional neural network for radar-based precipitation nowcasting. Its design was inspired by the U-Net and SegNet families of deep learning models, which were originally designed for binary segmentation tasks. RainNet was trained to predict continuous precipitation intensities at a lead time of 5 min, using several years of quality-controlled weather radar composites provided by the German Weather Service (DWD). That data set covers Germany with a spatial domain of 900 km×900 km and has a resolution of 1 km in space and 5 min in time. Independent verification experiments were carried out on 11 summer precipitation events from 2016 to 2017. In order to achieve a lead time of 1 h, a recursive approach was implemented by using RainNet predictions at 5 min lead times as model inputs for longer lead times. In the verification experiments, trivial Eulerian persistence and a conventional model based on optical flow served as benchmarks. The latter is available in the rainymotion library and had previously been shown to outperform DWD's operational nowcasting model for the same set of verification events. RainNet significantly outperforms the benchmark models at all lead times up to 60 min for the routine verification metrics mean absolute error (MAE) and the critical success index (CSI) at intensity thresholds of 0.125, 1, and 5 mm h−1. However, rainymotion turned out to be superior in predicting the exceedance of higher intensity thresholds (here 10 and 15 mm h−1). The limited ability of RainNet to predict heavy rainfall intensities is an undesirable property which we attribute to a high level of spatial smoothing introduced by the model. At a lead time of 5 min, an analysis of power spectral density confirmed a significant loss of spectral power at length scales of 16 km and below. Obviously, RainNet had learned an optimal level of smoothing to produce a nowcast at 5 min lead time. In that sense, the loss of spectral power at small scales is informative, too, as it reflects the limits of predictability as a function of spatial scale. Beyond the lead time of 5 min, however, the increasing level of smoothing is a mere artifact – an analogue to numerical diffusion – that is not a property of RainNet itself but of its recursive application. In the context of early warning, the smoothing is particularly unfavorable since pronounced features of intense precipitation tend to get lost over longer lead times. Hence, we propose several options to address this issue in prospective research, including an adjustment of the loss function for model training, model training for longer lead times, and the prediction of threshold exceedance in terms of a binary segmentation task. Furthermore, we suggest additional input data that could help to better identify situations with imminent precipitation dynamics. The model code, pretrained weights, and training data are provided in open repositories as an input for such future studies.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Erik""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: water","https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-13-2631-2020",NA,NA,NA

This study presents a novel deep learning approach: Super Resolution Deep Residual Network (SRDRN) for downscaling daily precipitation and temperature. This approach was constructed based on an advanced deep convolutional neural network with residual blocks and batch normalizations. The data augmentation technique was utilized to address overfitting that is due to highly imbalanced precipitation and nonprecipitation days and sparse precipitation extremes. Synthetic experiments were designed to downscale daily maximum/minimum temperature and precipitation data from coarse resolutions (25, 50, and 100 km) to a high resolution (4 km). The results showed that, during the validation period, the SRDRN approach not only captured the spatial and temporal patterns remarkably well, but also reproduced both precipitation and temperature extremes in different locations and time at the local scale. Through transfer learning, the trained SRDRN model in one region was directly applied to downscale precipitation in another region with a different environment, and the results showed notable improvement compared to classic statistical downscaling methods. The outstanding performance of the SRDRN approach stemmed from its ability to fully extract spatial features without suffering from degradation and overfitting issues due to the incorporations of residual blocks, batch normalizations, and data augmentations. The SRDRN approach is thus a powerful tool for downscaling daily precipitation and temperature and can potentially be leveraged to downscale any hydrologic, climate, and earth system data.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Erik""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: water","https://doi.org/10.1029/2020wr029308",NA,NA,NA

The US Department of Agriculture Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) operates the largest such system regionally. NRCS recently developed a next-generation WSF prototype, the multi-model machine-learning metasystem (M4). Here, we test this ensemble artificial intelligence (AI)-based prototype against challenging theoretical and practical criteria for accepting a new operational WSF model. In 20 hindcasting test-cases spanning diverse environments across the western US and Alaska, on average out-of-sample R2 and RPSS improved over 50% and RMSE improved 13% relative to current benchmarks. The M4 ensemble mean forecast also performed more consistently than any of its diverse constituent models and in several cases outperformed all of them. Live operational testing at a subset of sites during the 2020 forecast season additionally demonstrated logistical feasibility of workflows, as well as geophysical explainability of results in terms of known hydrologic processes, belying the black-box reputation of machine learning and enabling relatable forecast storylines for clients. This was accomplished using WSF-focused pragmatic solutions, like “popular votes” for different candidate predictors among the constituent forecast systems, and graphical visualization of reduced-dimension, AI-extracted nonlinear feature-target relationships. We also found that certain M4 technical design elements, including autonomous machine learning (AutoML), hyperparameter pre-calibration, and theory-guided data science, collectively permitted automated (“over-the-loop”) training and operation. Overall, the analyses confirmed M4 meets requirements for NRCS operational adoption. This finding signals that, despite negligible operational-community uptake of machine learning so far, suitably purpose-designed novel AI systems have capacity to transition into large-scale practical applications with service-delivery organizations; it appears M4 will be the largest AI migration into operational river forecasting to date.

TWSA showed a linear trend of −1.12 ± 0.05 cm yr−1 (equivalent to a volumetric trend of −1.79 ± 0.08 km3 yr−1) in the basin, and segregation of the constituent components of TWS revealed that the groundwater storage is a significant contributor (45%) to TWS with a linear trend of −0.51 ± 0.06 cm yr−1 (-0.82 ± 0.10 km3 yr−1) followed by surface water storage (i,e., cumulative of the water storage in the reservoirs, flood inundation, and rivers) (36%) and soil moisture storage (19%). The hydroclimatic extremes detected in TWSA are primarily triggered by the variations in precipitation during the monsoon season (May to October) and further amplified by the subsequent water storage and abstraction. TWSA attained a maximum of 42.86 cm in October 2011 during severe floods of 2011 (~95% increase in net precipitation during 2010 and 2011) and a minimum of −31.81 cm during the drought of May 2020 (~82% decrease in net precipitation during 2019 and 2020). All other flood and drought events in some years, e.g., 2006, 2010, 2015, 2016, are also well recorded in TWSA, albeit with a lag time of up to a maximum of two months from precipitation. Further, the basin’s increasing potential of severe drought, as assessed by the effective water-storage-based novel drought potential index (DPI), underscored the need for multifaceted water management essentially focused on the demand side rather than the supply side in the basin.

Hydrological forecasts are important for operational water management and near-future planning, even more so in light of the increased occurrences of extreme events such as floods and droughts. Having a forecasting framework, which is flexible in terms of input forcings and forecasting locations (local, regional, or national) that can deliver this information in fast and computational efficient manner, is critical. In this study, the suitability of a hybrid forecasting framework, combining data-driven approaches and seasonal (re)forecasting information from dynamical models, to predict hydrological variables was explored. Target variables include discharge and surface water levels for various stations at a national scale, with the Netherlands as the focus. Five different machine learning (ML) models, ranging from simple to more complex and trained on historical observations of discharge, precipitation, evaporation, and seawater levels, were run with seasonal (re)forecast data, including the European Flood Awareness System (EFAS) and ECMWF seasonal forecast system (SEAS5), of these driver variables in a hindcast setting. The results were evaluated using the evaluation metrics, i.e. anomaly correlation coefficient (ACC), continuous ranked probability (skill) score (CRPS and CRPSS), and Brier skill score (BSS), in comparison to a climatological reference hindcast. Aggregating the results of all stations and ML models revealed that the hindcasting framework outperformed the climatological reference forecasts by roughly 60 % for discharge predictions (80 % for surface water level predictions). Skilful prediction for the first lead month, independently of the initialization month, can be made for discharge. The skill extends up to 2–3 months for spring months due to snowmelt dynamic captured in the training phase of the model. Surface water level hindcasts showed similar skill and skilful lead times. While the different ML models showed differences in performance during a testing and training phase using historical observations, running the ML framework in a hindcast setting showed only minor differences between the models, which is attributed to the uncertainty in seasonal forecasts. However, despite being trained on historical observations, the hybrid framework used in this study shows similar skilful predictions to previous large-scale forecasting systems. With our study, we show that a hybrid framework is able to bring location-specific skilful seasonal forecast information with global seasonal forecast inputs. At the same time, our hybrid approach is flexible and fast, and as such, a hybrid framework could be adapted to make it even more interesting to water managers and their needs, for instance, as part of a fast model-predictive control framework.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Erik""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: water","https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-501-2023",NA,NA,NA

Natural rehabilitation of contaminated streams is mainly influenced by the longitudinal dispersion coefficient, or the rate of longitudinal dispersion (Dx), a key parameter with large spatiotemporal fluctuations that characterizes pollution transport. The large uncertainty in estimation of Dx in streams limits the water quality assessment in natural streams and design of water quality enhancement strategies. This study develops an artificial intelligence-based predictive model, coupling granular computing and neural network models (GrC-ANN) to provide robust estimation of Dx and its uncertainty for a range of flow-geometric conditions with high spatiotemporal variability. Uncertainty analysis of Dx estimated from the proposed GrC-ANN model was performed by alteration of the training data used to tune the model.

Comparison between the Dx values estimated by GrC-ANN to those determined from tracer measurements shows the appropriateness and robustness of the proposed method in determining the rate of longitudinal dispersion.

Particularly in regions like Cork City, which have experienced heavy precipitation events, accurate prediction is vital for informed decision-making.

In these regions, accurate quantification and prediction of water flow is challenging, mainly due to significant climatic variability and sparse monitoring networks. In the context of flow forecasting, this work evaluates the accuracy of two physical models (WEAP and GR2M) and two models based on artificial neural networks (ANN) that use meteorological data as input variables. Then, a hybrid technique is proposed, using the time series generated by the individual models as inputs of a new ANN.

State-of-the-art global hydrological models (GHMs) exhibit large uncertainties in hydrological simulations due to the complexity, diversity, and heterogeneity of the land surface and subsurface processes, as well as the scale dependency of these processes and associated parameters. Recent progress in machine learning, fueled by relevant Earth observation data streams, may help overcome these challenges. But machine learning methods are not bound by physical laws, and their interpretability is limited by design. In this study, we exemplify a hybrid approach to global hydrological modeling that exploits the data adaptivity of neural networks for representing uncertain processes within a model structure based on physical principles (e.g., mass conservation) that form the basis of GHMs. This combination of machine learning and physical knowledge can potentially lead to data-driven, yet physically consistent and partially interpretable hybrid models. The hybrid hydrological model (H2M), extended from Kraft et al. (2020), simulates the dynamics of snow, soil moisture, and groundwater storage globally at 1∘ spatial resolution and daily time step. Water fluxes are simulated by an embedded recurrent neural network. We trained the model simultaneously against observational products of terrestrial water storage variations (TWS), grid cell runoff (Q), evapotranspiration (ET), and snow water equivalent (SWE) with a multi-task learning approach. We find that the H2M is capable of reproducing key patterns of global water cycle components, with model performances being at least on par with four state-of-the-art GHMs which provide a necessary benchmark for H2M. The neural-network-learned hydrological responses of evapotranspiration and grid cell runoff to antecedent soil moisture states are qualitatively consistent with our understanding and theory. The simulated contributions of groundwater, soil moisture, and snowpack variability to TWS variations are plausible and within the ranges of traditional GHMs. H2M identifies a somewhat stronger role of soil moisture for TWS variations in transitional and tropical regions compared to GHMs. With the findings and analysis, we conclude that H2M provides a new data-driven perspective on modeling the global hydrological cycle and physical responses with machine-learned parameters that is consistent with and complementary to existing global modeling frameworks. The hybrid modeling approaches have a large potential to better leverage ever-increasing Earth observation data streams to advance our understandings of the Earth system and capabilities to monitor and model it.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Erik""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: water","https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-1579-2022",NA,NA,NA

The numerical models can estimate groundwater level (GWL) based on extensive statistics and information and using complex equations in any area. But one of the most important challenges in analyzing and predicting groundwater depletion in water management is the lack of reliable and complete data. For this reason, the use of artificial intelligence models with high predictive accuracy and due to the need for less data is inevitable. In recent years, the use of different numerical models has been noticed as an efficient solution. These models are able to estimate groundwater levels in any region based on extensive statistics and information and also various field experiments such as pumping tests, geophysics, soil and land use maps, topography and slope data, different boundary conditions and complex equations. In the current research, first, by using available statistics, information and maps, the groundwater level fluctuations of the Sonqor plain are simulated by the GMS model, and the accuracy of the model is evaluated in two stages of calibration and validation. Then, due to the need for much less data volume in artificial intelligence-based methods, the GA-ANN and ICA-ANN hybrid methods and the ELM and ORELM models are utilized. The results display that the output of the ORELM model has the best fit with observed data with a correlation coefficient equal to 0.96, and it also has the best and closest scatter points around the 45 degrees line, and in this sense, it is considered as the most accurate model. To ensure the correct selection of the best model, the Taylor diagram is also used. The results demonstrate that the closest point to the reference point is related to the ORELM method. Therefore, to predict the groundwater level in the whole plain, instead of using the complex GMS model with a very large volume of data and also the very time-consuming process of calibration and verification, the ORELM model can be used with confidence. This approach greatly helps researchers to predict groundwater level variations in dry and wet years using artificial intelligence with high accuracy instead of numerical models with complex and time-consuming structures.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Erik""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: water","https://doi.org/10.1007/s13201-022-01861-7",NA,NA,NA

Here we assess global vegetation sensitivity to soil moisture during 1982-2017 by applying explainable machine learning with observation-based leaf area index (LAI) and hydro-climate anomaly data. We show that LAI sensitivity to soil moisture significantly increases in many semi-arid and arid regions. LAI sensitivity trends are associated with multiple hydro-climate and ecological variables, and strongest increasing trends occur in the most water-sensitive regions which additionally experience declining precipitation. State-of-the-art land surface models do not reproduce this increasing sensitivity as they misrepresent water-sensitive regions and sensitivity strength.

Accurate detection of macroplastic litter (plastic items >5 mm) in water is essential to estimate the quantities, compositions and sources, identify emerging trends, and design preventive measures or mitigation strategies. In recent years, researchers have demonstrated the potential of computer vision (CV) techniques based on deep learning (DL) for automated detection of macroplastic litter in water bodies. However, a systematic review to describe the state-of-the-art of the field is lacking. Here we provide such a review, and we highlight current knowledge gaps and suggest promising future research directions. The review compares 34 papers with respect to their application and modeling related criteria. The results show that the researchers have employed a variety of DL architectures implementing different CV techniques to detect macroplastic litter in various aquatic environments. However, key knowledge gaps must be addressed to overcome the lack of: (i) DL-based macroplastic litter detection models with sufficient generalization capability, (ii) DL-based quantification of macroplastic (mass) fluxes and hotspots and (iii) scalable macroplastic litter monitoring strategies based on robust DL-based quantification. We advocate for the exploration of data-centric artificial intelligence approaches and semi-supervised learning to develop models with improved generalization capabilities. These models can boost the development of new methods for the quantification of macroplastic (mass) fluxes and hotspots, and allow for structural monitoring strategies that leverage robust DL-based quantification.

There is a crucial need for a good soil and water management system to overcome the challenges of water scarcity and other natural adverse events like floods and landslides, among others. Rainfall–runoff (R-R) modeling is an appropriate approach for runoff prediction, making it possible to take preventive measures to avoid damage caused by natural hazards such as floods. In the present study, several data-driven models, namely, multiple linear regression (MLR), multiple adaptive regression splines (MARS), support vector machine (SVM), and random forest (RF), were used for rainfall–runoff prediction of the Gola watershed, located in the south-eastern part of the Uttarakhand. The rainfall–runoff model analysis was conducted using daily rainfall and runoff data for 12 years (2009 to 2020) of the Gola watershed. The first 80% of the complete data was used to train the model, and the remaining 20% was used for the testing period. The performance of the models was evaluated based on the coefficient of determination (R2), root mean square error (RMSE), Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), and percent bias (PBAIS) indices. In addition to the numerical comparison, the models were evaluated. Their performances were evaluated based on graphical plotting, i.e., time-series line diagram, scatter plot, violin plot, relative error plot, and Taylor diagram (TD). The comparison results revealed that the four heuristic methods gave higher accuracy than the MLR model.

High-quality gridded soil moisture products are essential for many Earth system science applications, while the recent reanalysis and remote sensing soil moisture data are often available at coarse resolution and remote sensing data are only for the surface soil. Here, we present a 1 km resolution long-term dataset of soil moisture derived through machine learning trained by the in situ measurements of 1789 stations over China, named SMCI1.0 (Soil Moisture of China by in situ data, version 1.0). Random forest is used as a robust machine learning approach to predict soil moisture using ERA5-Land time series, leaf area index, land cover type, topography and soil properties as predictors. SMCI1.0 provides 10-layer soil moisture with 10 cm intervals up to 100 cm deep at daily resolution over the period 2000–2020. Using in situ soil moisture as the benchmark, two independent experiments were conducted to evaluate the estimation accuracy of SMCI1.0: year-to-year (ubRMSE ranges from 0.041 to 0.052 and R ranges from 0.883 to 0.919) and station-to-station experiments (ubRMSE ranges from 0.045 to 0.051 and R ranges from 0.866 to 0.893). SMCI1.0 generally has advantages over other gridded soil moisture products, including ERA5-Land, SMAP-L4, and SoMo.ml. However, the high errors of soil moisture are often located in the North China Monsoon Region. Overall, the highly accurate estimations of both the year-to-year and station-to-station experiments ensure the applicability of SMCI1.0 to study the spatial–temporal patterns. As SMCI1.0 is based on in situ data, it can be a useful complement to existing model-based and satellite-based soil moisture datasets for various hydrological, meteorological, and ecological analyses and models.

Numerous monitoring tools have been developed that can alert stakeholders to the onset of cyanobacterial blooms to initiate mitigation efforts for waters used for recreation or drinking water supply. Early warning monitoring systems need to consider multiple aspects of a cyanobacterial bloom: whether a bloom is occurring in the source water, whether it might be transported to drinking water intakes, whether toxin or taste and odor compound producers are present and what proportion of the cells in a bloom they comprise, and whether cells are entering a utility at concentrations above threshold levels. No single monitoring tool can provide all this information, so multi-barrier approaches are needed. Reviews of monitoring tools and their variations are available, but they are generally limited to one type of tool. Instead, a review and comparison of all the available tools is needed to inform stakeholders of them and their relative advantages and limitations. Therefore, this review covers conventional tools including microscopic enumeration, pigment extraction, qPCR, probes, and remote sensing as well as emerging techniques including next-generation sequencing, photonic systems, biosensors, drones, and applications of machine learning and discusses them primarily from a practical and operational standpoint. Moreover, a three-tier framework is proposed for designing comprehensive early warning systems that groups monitoring tools by their analytical targets: biological activity or algal biomass, cyanobacteria or cyanobacteria-related genes, and cyanobacterial metabolites. First tier tools are generally simple and inexpensive to use, including turbidity, optical density, visual inspection, drones, chlorophyll a, and adenosine triphosphate. Changes in water quality conditions detected using a first tier tool triggers the use of a second tier tools for identification and quantification of cyanobacteria by microscopy, phycocyanin, biosensors, hyperspectral remote sensing, or next-generation sequencing. If potentially harmful concentrations of cyanobacteria are confirmed, third tier tools are deployed for quantifying concentrations of cyanotoxins and taste and odor compounds or the genes that encode for them using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, mass spectrometry, qPCR, or other analytical methods. This framework is designed to minimize the time and cost associated with cyanobacteria monitoring without compromising the ability of stakeholders to detect the onset of a bloom.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Erik""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: water","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2021.108442",NA,NA,NA

However, these numerical simulators produce outputs with low spatial resolution that exhibit difficulties representing precipitation events accurately.

To improve the prediction of high resolution precipitation we apply a Deep Learning (DL) approach using input data from a reanalysis product, that is comparable to a climate model’s output, but can be directly related to precipitation observations at a given time and location. Further, our input excludes local precipitation, but includes model fields (weather variables) that are more predictable and generalizable than local precipitation. To this end, we present TRU-NET (Temporal Recurrent U-Net), an encoder-decoder model featuring a novel 2D cross attention mechanism between contiguous convolutional-recurrent layers to effectively model multi-scale spatio-temporal weather processes.

Terrestrial water storage (TWS) is a crucial indicator of regional water balance and water resources changes. Due to limited hydrological observations, we combined the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and GRACE Follow-On (GRACE-FO) products using the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network to monitor the TWS changes from April 2002 to March 2020 over the closed Qaidam Basin in northwest China and examined the impacts of climate and meteorological changes on TWS variations. The results indicated that the LSTM model, driven by the cumulative precipitation, temperature, and Global Land Data Assimilation System datasets, was reliable for use in reconstruction of the GRACE products in the closed basin. The TWS variations featured seasonal variation characteristics and a significant upward trend at internal-annual scales, which were tested via linear statistics and a modified Mann–Kendall method. The increasing trend is likely to remain strongly sustainable in the near future with a Hurst index over 0.75 in most regions. Moreover, the TWS oscillation has a periodicity and nonlinearity increase trend of 0.43 mm/month as observed using ensemble empirical mode decomposition analysis, and the TWS components (including snow water equivalent, soil moisture, and groundwater) demonstrate discordant increasing trends in the basin. Under climate change conditions, teleconnection factors have strong impacts on TWS variability, particularly for the Pacific Decadal Oscillation index with a significant negative correlation by cross wavelet transform technology. Nonetheless, the increase in TWS is primarily influenced by precipitation increases and is more sensitive to the accumulated precipitation in this region.

Existing studies have reported a hook structure for precipitation extreme-temperature relationships but have rarely examined the underlying physical mechanisms. Previous studies have also failed to quantify the impact of precipitation on ecosystem productivity, hindering the assessment of future extreme climatic hazards and potential ecosystem risks. To reveal the thermodynamic driving mechanisms for the formation of global precipitation extremes and ecohydrological effects, this study utilizes over ten multisource datasets (i.e., satellite, reanalysis, climate model, land surface model, machine learning reconstruction, and flux tower measurements). We first assess the response of water-heat-carbon flux to precipitation extremes and explain the underlying physical mechanisms behind the hook structures in terms of atmospheric thermodynamics and dynamics. Based on outputs from five global climate models (GCMs) under ISIMIP3b, we project future changes in the hook structures as well as their impacts on precipitation extremes. Finally, we discuss the impact of precipitation on the terrestrial carbon budget by using outputs from the CLM4.5 model. The results show that precipitation extremes are usually accompanied by strong exchanges of water and heat and demonstrate a nonlinear relationship between precipitation and ecosystem productivity. The intensity (duration) of extreme precipitation is intensifying (decreasing) over most areas of the globe, whereas three-dimensional precipitation events are becoming more concentrated. Atmospheric dynamics play a key role in shaping the hook structure. The structure is not stable; it shifts under climate change and is projected to result in a 10–10% intensification in precipitation by the end of this century. Moderate levels of precipitation contribute to carbon assimilation in ecosystems, and the response of the carbon budget to precipitation is relatively stable under climate change.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Erik""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: water","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11430-022-9987-0",NA,NA,NA

These systems will greatly enhance the ability to collect interdisciplinary observations on-demand and in previously inaccessible environments. Looking forward, advances in sensor miniaturization are discussed alongside the incorporation of citizen science, moving toward open and FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable) data. Advances in machine learning and cloud computing allow for exploitation of the full electromagnetic spectrum, and better bridging across the larger scientific community that also includes biogeochemical modelers and climate scientists. These advances will place sophisticated remote sensing capabilities into the hands of individual users and provide on-demand imagery tailored to research and management requirements, as well as provide critical input to marine and climate forecasting systems. The next decade of hyperspectral aquatic remote sensing is on the cusp of revolutionizing the way we assess and monitor aquatic environments and detect changes relevant to global communities.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Erik""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: water","https://doi.org/10.3389/fenvs.2021.649528",NA,NA,NA

Vital to quantifying crop water needs, accurate predictions of ET0 are particularly critical in arid regions, where they allow for informed water resources management adjustments through changes to agricultural irrigation rates and scheduling. Drawing upon 84 meteorological stations in northwest China, spatiotemporal variations in present-day ET0 were investigated."", ""Support vector regression (SVR), Extreme learning machine (ELM), and Multivariate adaptive regression spline (MARS) — three machine learning (ML) techniques — served to establish relationships between historical ET0 and the Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment – East Asia (CORDEX-EA), drawn from the output data sets of each of three regional climate models (RCM): Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF), Regional Climate Model version 4.0 (RegCM4) and the Mesoscale Model version 5 (MM5). The ML-RCM combinations were calibrated and validated with separate batches (66:34, respectively) of historical ET0 data, and their respective performance and level of uncertainty were assessed statistically."", ""In the historical period (1960–2017) ET0 declined by −0.15, −0.75, and − 0.42 mm y−1 in north Xinjiang, south Xinjiang, and Qinghai region, respectively, and increased in the Hexi Corridor by 0.5 mm y−1. For all four regions, the MARS-WRF and MARS-MM5 combinations performed well and showed greater predictive accuracy than either ELM-WRF or ELM-MM5 combinations. Performances in predicting future (2035–2050) ET0 from CORDEX-EA outputs based on regional climate predictions RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios, depended to a greater extent on the RCM outputs that were selected, rather than the modeling methods. Future ET0 predicted from RCMs generally exhibit increasing trends, and more significantly under the RCP 8.5 scenario. "", ""The representation and characterization ability of RCMs to future climate change is crucial for future ET0 projection. Uncertainty analysis, achieved by employing multiple RCMs to predict future ET0, is highly recommended. Knowledge of trends in future ET0 can help guide the management of agricultural irrigation in oases and support decision-makers engaged in water resources management in the future.""]}","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosres.2020.104868",NA,NA,NA

The proposed method could be used in urban and rural areas for consumption and quality monitoring, or eventually scaled up to a contemporary water infrastructure enabling water providers and/or decision makers (i.e., governmental authorities, global water organization, etc.) to supervise and drive optimal decisions in challenging times. The inherent resilience and agility that the proposed system presents, along with the maturity of IoT communications and infrastructure, can lay the foundation for a robust smart water metering solution. Introducing a modular system can also allow for optimal consumer profiling while alleviating the upfront adoption cost by providers, environmental stewardship and an optimal response to emergencies. The provided system addresses the urbanization and technological gap in the smart water metering domain by presenting a modular IoT architecture with consumption and quality meters, along with machine learning capabilities to facilitate smart billing and user profiling.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Maria""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: water","https://doi.org/10.3390/su15032127",NA,NA,NA

This article reviews and critically analyses the recent advances in the field of analogue and reservoir computing that have been driven by the unique physical properties and energy of water waves. It also demonstrates that analogue and physical reservoir computing, taken as an independent research field, holds the potential to bring artificial intelligence closer to people living outside large cities, thus enabling them to enjoy the benefits of novel technologies that are already in place in large cities but are not readily available or suitable for regional communities. In particular, although the physical reservoir computing systems discussed in the main text are universal in terms of processing input data and making forecasts, they can be used to design and optimise power grid networks and forecast energy consumption, both at local and global scales. Thus, this review article will be of interest to a broad readership interested in novel concepts of artificial intelligence and machine learning and their innovative practical applications in diverse areas of science and technology.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Maria""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: water","https://doi.org/10.3390/en16145366",NA,NA,NA

Existing methods are unable to characterize groundwater storage loss at the global scale with sufficient resolution to be relevant for local studies. Here we explore the interrelation between groundwater stress, aquifer depletion, and land subsidence using remote sensing and model-based datasets with a machine learning approach. The developed model predicts global land subsidence magnitude at high spatial resolution (~2 km), provides a first-order estimate of aquifer storage loss due to consolidation of ~17 km3/year globally, and quantifies key drivers of subsidence. Roughly 73% of the mapped subsidence occurs over cropland and urban areas, highlighting the need for sustainable groundwater management practices over these areas. The results of this study aid in assessing the spatial extents of subsidence in known subsiding areas, and in locating unknown groundwater stressed regions.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Maria""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: water","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-41933-z",NA,NA,NA
