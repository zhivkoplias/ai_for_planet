Here, we use recreation to show how social media data, machine learning, and spatial analysis techniques can improve our understanding of human-nature interactions and the mapping of recreational ecosystem services. We extracted 80,500 photographs taken in non-urban areas of the Tahoe Central Sierra Initiative project area in California between 2005 and 2019 that were posted to the photo sharing application Flickr and used these as a proxy for recreational visits to the area. Automated image content analysis was used to identify the objects and concepts in the photographs and uncover the types of nature experiences that are important to visitors. Additionally, variable importance, a Random Forest machine learning technique, was used to examine the environmental and landscape variables that drive recreation in the area and to create a classification model that predicts the recreation potential of the entire area based on important variables. The automated image content analysis identified 1,239 unique labels linked to recreation, with mountains, hills, and rocks being the most prominent features (22%). Our Random Forest model indicates that vegetation cover, land cover, elevation, smoke days, and landscape features are major drivers of recreation in the area and are of interest to visitors in the area. The model predicted that 25.9% of the area has the potential to support recreational visits. Most of these recreation potential areas are in protected areas (77.8%), predominantly in conifer forests (66%) and within national forest boundaries, especially the Tahoe National Forest area (37.6%). These results show that recreational ecosystem services vary across landscapes and illustrate the need for improved mapping approaches to determine the provision of ecosystem services in different places. The analysis provides novel insights into the various ways social media data and machine learning techniques can be powerful components of ecosystem service research and how they hold great potential for monitoring and informing management interventions on ecosystem service provision, especially in places with limited traditional onsite visitation data.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Erik""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: earth","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2023.110606",NA,NA,NA

Here, a U-net deep learning model was used to map monthly tropical tree cover in the Brazilian state of Mato Grosso between 2015 and 2021 using 5 m spatial resolution Planet NICFI satellite images. The accuracy of the tree cover model was extremely high, with an F1-score &gt;0.98, further confirmed by an independent LiDAR validation showing that 95% of tree cover pixels had a height &gt;5 m while 98% of non-tree cover pixels had a height &lt;5 m. The biannual map of deforestation was then built from the monthly tree cover map. The deforestation map showed relatively consistent agreement with the official deforestation map from Brazil (67.2%) but deviated significantly from Global Forest Change (GFC)’s year of forest loss, showing that our product is closest to the product made by visual interpretation. Finally, we estimated that 14.8% of Mato Grosso’s total area had undergone clear-cut logging between 2015 and 2021, and that deforestation was increasing, with December 2021, the last date, being the highest. High-resolution imagery from Planet NICFI in conjunction with deep learning techniques can significantly improve the mapping of deforestation extent in tropical regions.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Erik""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: earth","https://doi.org/10.3390/rs15020521",NA,NA,NA

Modeling parcel-level urban development controlling contemporaneous and historical conditions involve computational challenges since data sizes grow quickly beyond the capabilities of conventional statistical-based spatial models. Machine Learning (ML) methods provide computationally feasible methods for large-scale data sets. This paper introduces new ML applications using advanced algorithms and GPU parallel processing to model large-scale urban land developments. Special attention is given to accelerating the construction of spatial weight matrices and training ML models. Specifically, artificial neural networks and random forests are applied to the state of Florida’s land-use data, which contains nearly 9 million parcels, to predict parcels with changes in their land use based on historical and neighborhood data. The adaptive Hashing algorithm coupled with GPU parallel processing accelerates the average processing time for identifying the fixed number of nearest neighbors used for accounting spatial autocorrelation, by almost 16,000 times. Also, ML model training times are shortened by 49–547 times using GPU. Further, our best ML model achieves approximately 92% accuracy while outperforming some competing methods, including logistic regression. Such a high prediction accuracy helps policymakers adjust budget allocations to meet local land-use change projections.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Erik""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: earth","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scs.2023.104390",NA,NA,NA

This has brought huge losses to the tea industry. Traditionally, the freezing injury of tea plants in the field was assessed by vision. This is labor-intensive and subjective. In this research, multimodal remote sensing data from different periods of natural overwintering tea plantations were collected by using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) equipped with multispectral (MS), thermal infrared (TIR) and RGB sensors. And the physiological data of tea leaves on the same day were obtained to construct a tea cold injury score (TCIS). Then, a convolutional neural networks-gate recurrent unit (CNN-GRU) model was improved for estimating TCIS. To better compare the performance of CNN-GRU, a single GRU model and three classical machine learning models were also used for comparison. The study found that: (1) The multimodal data fusion was superior to the unimodal data. The best prediction results were achieved for the combined bimodal MS + RGB data (Rp2 = 0.862, RMSEP = 0.138, RPD = 2.220); (2) The CNN-GRU hybrid model was superior to the other four baseline models. The best effect was achieved based on the multivariate input of MS + RGB (Rp2 = 0.862) or MS + RGB + TIR (Rp2 = 0.850); (3) The accuracy of the model after removing soil features was lower than that of the model without background removal. Therefore, the TCIS-CNN-GRU model combined with multi-source remote sensing data can objectively and accurately evaluate the cold injury phenotype of tea plants, making the CNN-GRU model more scientific and promising.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Erik""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: earth","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compag.2023.108176",NA,NA,NA

In the computer vision domain, Vision Transformers (ViTs) have shown their superiority compared to extensively utilized convolutional neural networks (CNNs) over the last couple of years. Although, ViTs has several challenges, specifically in remote sensing image processing, including their significant complexity that increases the computation costs and their need for much higher reference data than that of CNNs. As such, in this paper, we introduce an attention gates aided TransU-Net, called TransU-Net++ for semantic segmentation with an application of deforestation mapping in two South American forest biomes, i.e., the Atlantic Forest and the Amazon Rainforest. The heterogeneous kernel convolution (HetConv), U-Net, attention gates, and ViTs are all utilized in the proposed TransU-Net++ to their advantage. The TransU-Net++ significantly increased the performance of TransU-Net's over the Atlantic Forest dataset by about 4%, 6%, and 16%, respectively, in terms of overall accuracy, F1-score, and recall, respectively.Moreover, the results show that the developed TrasnU-Net++ model (0.921) achieves the highest Area under the ROC Curve value in the 3-band Amazon forest dataset as compared to other segmentation models, including ICNet (0.667), ENet (0.69), SegNet (0.788), U-Net (0.871), Attention U-Net-2 (0.886), R2U-Net (0.888), TransU-Net (0.889), Swin U-Net (0.893), ResU-Net (0.896), U-Net+++ (0.9), and Attention U-Net (0.908), respectively.

This study was conducted in the Belpada Block of Balangir, Odisha, a forest-dominated region of eastern India. We recorded species occurrence and measured plant parameters, including Circumference at Breast Height (CBH), height, and geolocation, in 196 plots (0.09 ha) in agroforestry intervention sites and noted the tree species.

Owing to the 3-dimensional nature of forest structure, remote sensing using airborne LiDAR can be used to perform these measurements of vegetation structure at large scale. Harnessing the full dimensionality of the data, we present deep learning systems predicting wood volume and above ground biomass (AGB) directly from the full LiDAR point cloud and compare results to state-of-the-art approaches operating on basic statistics of the point clouds. For this purpose, we devise different neural network architectures for point cloud regression and evaluate them on remote sensing data of areas for which AGB estimates have been obtained from field measurements in the Danish national forest inventory. Our adaptation of Minkowski convolutional neural networks for regression give the best results. The deep neural networks produce significantly more accurate wood volume, AGB, and carbon stock estimates compared to state-of-the-art approaches. In contrast to other methods, the proposed deep learning approach does not require a digital terrain model and is robust to artifacts along the boundaries of the evaluated areas, which we demonstrate for the case where trees protrude into the area from the outside.

It lets us understand and monitor both legal and illegal deforestation and its implications, which include the effect deforestation may have on climate change through greenhouse gas emissions.

Although studies have been using DL algorithms for a variety of remote sensing tasks for the past few years, they are still relatively unexplored for deforestation mapping. We attempted to map the deforestation between images approximately one year apart, specifically between 2017 and 2018 and between 2018 and 2019. Three CNN architectures that are available in the literature—SharpMask, U-Net, and ResUnet—were used to classify the change between years and were then compared to two classic machine learning (ML) algorithms—random forest (RF) and multilayer perceptron (MLP)—as points of reference. After validation, we found that the DL models were better in most performance metrics including the Kappa index, F1 score, and mean intersection over union (mIoU) measure, while the ResUnet model achieved the best overall results with a value of 0.94 in all three measures in both time sequences. Visually, the DL models also provided classifications with better defined deforestation patches and did not need any sort of post-processing to remove noise, unlike the ML models, which needed some noise removal to improve results.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Erik""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: earth","https://doi.org/10.3390/rs12060901",NA,NA,NA

Earth sciences already use data assimilation (DA), which underpins decades of progress in weather forecasting. DA and ML have many similarities: they are both inverse methods that can be united under a Bayesian (probabilistic) framework. ML could benefit from approaches used in DA, which has evolved to deal with real observations-these are uncertain, sparsely sampled, and only indirectly sensitive to the processes of interest. DA could also become more like ML and start learning improved models of the earth system, using parameter estimation, or by directly incorporating machine-learnable models. DA follows the Bayesian approach more exactly in terms of representing uncertainty, and in retaining existing physical knowledge, which helps to better constrain the learnt aspects of models. This article makes equivalences between DA and ML in the unifying framework of Bayesian networks. These help illustrate the equivalences between four-dimensional variational (4D-Var) DA and a recurrent neural network (RNN), for example. More broadly, Bayesian networks are graphical representations of the knowledge and processes embodied in earth system models, giving a framework for organising modelling components and knowledge, whether coming from physical equations or learnt from observations. Their full Bayesian solution is not computationally feasible but these networks can be solved with approximate methods already used in DA and ML, so they could provide a practical framework for the unification of the two. Development of all these approaches could address the grand challenge of making better use of observations to improve physical models of earth system processes.

However, previous CA models have usually ignored the inhomogeneous and mixed land-use situations and simplified the land grid cell as one single land-use type. This study developed a multi-label (ML) convolutional neural network CA (ML-CNN-CA) model to simulate the complex evolution of mixed land uses. The multi-label learning strategy in the proposed model can formulize mixed land uses by labeling multiple land-use types to each grid cell. The transition rules of CA were modified to accommodate the multi-label learning strategy and mined by coupling a CNN network and three interactive mechanisms, including the neighborhood effect, adaptive inertia coefficient, and random factor. The proposed ML-CNN-CA model was applied and examined in a fast-developing city (Huizhou) in the China's Pearl River Delta region for the mixed land-use simulation during 2009–2013 and 2013–2020. The ML-CNN-CA model with different CNN architectures and a previous artificial neural network (ANN)-based multi-label CA model were also implemented for comparisons. Results show the capability of the ML-CNN-CA model to simulate fine-scale mixed land-use changes with satisfactory performances. Specifically, the simulated mixed land-use patterns agree well with the actual land uses from the morphological perspective. Furthermore, the quantitative assessments demonstrate the performance of the proposed model, showing an accuracy value of 0.912 for 2009–2013 and 0.896 for 2013–2020, and a hamming loss value of 0.048 for 2009–2013 and 0.055 for 2013–2020. The comparisons also show the best performance of the ML-CNN-CA model with the VGG-based architecture and significant outperformance of the proposed model against the previous ANN-based CA model. Multiple sensitivity analyses were also conducted to investigate the uncertainty of the proposed model. The ML-CNN-CA model proposed in this study can provide a new tool for better simulation of fine-scale mixed land-use changes and is expected to help formulate urban planning guidelines and achieve sustainable urban development.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Erik""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: earth","https://doi.org/10.1080/15481603.2022.2049493",NA,NA,NA

As such, neural networks have often been used within the geosciences to most accurately identify a desired output given a set of inputs, with the interpretation of what the network learns used as a secondary metric to ensure the network is making the right decision for the right reason. Neural network interpretation techniques have become more advanced in recent years, however, and we therefore propose that the ultimate objective of using a neural network can also be the interpretation of what the network has learned rather than the output itself. We show that the interpretation of neural networks can enable the discovery of scientifically meaningful connections within geoscientific data. In particular, we use two methods for neural network interpretation called backwards optimization and layerwise relevance propagation, both of which project the decision pathways of a network back onto the original input dimensions. To the best of our knowledge, LRP has not yet been applied to geoscientific research, and we believe it has great potential in this area. We show how these interpretation techniques can be used to reliably infer scientifically meaningful information from neural networks by applying them to common climate patterns.

Therefore, this study, for the first time in Sri Lanka, was carried out to understand the most important parameters affecting the water depth of the Colombo flood detention basin. The temporal behavior of water level fluctuations was tested among various combinations of hydro-meteorological parameters with the help of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). As expected, rainfall was found to be the most impacting parameter; however, apart from that, some interesting combinations of meteorological parameters were found as the second layer of impacting parameters. The rainfall-nighttime relative humidity, rainfall-evaporation, daytime relative humidity-evaporation, and rainfall-nighttime relative humidity-evaporation combinations were highly impactful toward the water level fluctuations.

A random forest model was calibrated using spatial cross-validation according to the precision-recall area under the curve (PR-AUC) index using ca. 135,000 soil or flora plots from archive databases, as well as 5 m topographical variables derived from an airborne DTM and a geological map. The model was validated using an experimentally designed sampling strategy with ca. 3000 plots collected during a ground survey in 2021 along non-wetland/wetland transects. Map accuracy was then compared to those of nine existing wetland maps with global, European, or national coverage. The model-derived suitability map (PR-AUC 0.76) highlights the gradual boundaries and fine-grained pattern of wetlands. The binary map is significantly more accurate (F1-score 0.75, overall accuracy 0.67) than existing wetland maps. The approach and end-results are of important value for spatial planning and environmental management since the high-resolution suitability and binary maps enable more targeted conservation measures to support biodiversity conservation, water resources maintenance, and carbon storage.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Erik""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: earth","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2023.e13482",NA,NA,NA

In grassland area, dust containing heavy metal(loid)s generated by mines may further migrate to remote places, but few studies have focused on the long-range transport of contaminants as an important pollution source. In the present study, one of the largest and most intact grassland ecosystems, the Mongolian-Manchurian steppe, was selected to investigate its pollution status and track potential sources. A total of 150 soil samples were collected to explore reginal distribution of nine heavy metal(loid)s that has potential risk in grassland. We conducted a combined multi-variant analysis of positive matrix factorization (PMF) and machine learning, which foregrounded the source of long-range transport of contaminants and inspired the hypothesis of a novel stochastic model to describe contaminants distribution. Results showed four different sources accounting for 44.44% (parent material), 20.28% (atmospheric deposition), 20.39% (farming), and 14.89% (transportation) of the total concentration, respectively. Factor 2 indicated that coal surface mining lead to a significant enrichment of As and Se with their concentration far above the global average level, which was different from other reported grassland areas. Machine learning results further confirmed that atmospheric and topographic features were their contamination controlling factors. The model results proposed that As, Se and Cu released by surface mining will be transported over long distance under prevailing monsoon, until finally deposited in the windward slope of mountain due to terrain obstruction. The long-range transport by wind and deposition of contaminants may be a prevailing phenomenon in temperate grassland, making it a pollution source that cannot be ignored. Evidence from this study reveals the urgency of precautions for fragile grassland ecosystems around industrial areas and provides a basis for its management and risk control policies.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Erik""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: earth","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2023.108019",NA,NA,NA

GCMs are physics-based simulators that combine a numerical solver for large-scale dynamics with tuned representations for small-scale processes such as cloud formation. Recently, machine-learning models trained on reanalysis data have achieved comparable or better skill than GCMs for deterministic weather forecasting 3,4 . However, these models have not demonstrated improved ensemble forecasts, or shown sufficient stability for long-term weather and climate simulations. Here we present a GCM that combines a differentiable solver for atmospheric dynamics with machine-learning components and show that it can generate forecasts of deterministic weather, ensemble weather and climate on par with the best machine-learning and physics-based methods. NeuralGCM is competitive with machine-learning models for one- to ten-day forecasts, and with the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ensemble prediction for one- to fifteen-day forecasts. With prescribed sea surface temperature, NeuralGCM can accurately track climate metrics for multiple decades, and climate forecasts with 140-kilometre resolution show emergent phenomena such as realistic frequency and trajectories of tropical cyclones. For both weather and climate, our approach offers orders of magnitude computational savings over conventional GCMs, although our model does not extrapolate to substantially different future climates. Our results show that end-to-end deep learning is compatible with tasks performed by conventional GCMs and can enhance the large-scale physical simulations that are essential for understanding and predicting the Earth system.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Erik""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: earth","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07744-y",NA,NA,NA

As such, the driving factors, conversion rules, and rate of change vary for different regions around the world. However, most cellular automata (CA) models use the same transition rules for all cells in the model space when simulating land-use change. Thus, spatial heterogeneity change is ignored in the model, which means that these models are prone to over- or under simulation, resulting in a large deviation from reality. An effective means of accounting for the influence of spatial heterogeneity on the quality of the CA model is to establish a partitioned model based on cellular space partitioning. This study established a partitioned, dual-constrained CA model using the area-weighted frequency of land-use change (AWFLUC) to capture its spatial heterogeneity. This model was used to simulate the land-use evolution of the Dianchi Lake watershed. First, the CA space was divided into subzones using a dual-constrained spatial clustering method. Second, an artificial neural network (ANN) was used to automatically acquire conversion rules to construct an ANN-CA model of land-use change. Finally, land-use changes were simulated using the ANN-CA model based on data from 2006 to 2016, and model reliability was validated. The experimental results showed that compared with the non-partitioned CA model, the partitioned counterpart was able to improve the accuracy of land-use change simulation significantly. Furthermore, AWFLUC is an important indicator of the spatial heterogeneity of land-use change. The shapes of the division spaces were more similar to reality and the simulation accuracy was higher when AWFLUC was considered as a land-use change characteristic.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Erik""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: earth","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijgi10050346",NA,NA,NA

The traditional change detection methods based on HR remote sensing images mostly only detect a single land type or only the change range, and cannot simultaneously detect the change of all object types and pixel-level range changes in the area. To overcome this difficulty, we propose a new coarse-to-fine deep learning-based land-use change detection method. We independently created a new scene classification dataset called NS-55, and innovatively considered the adaptation relationship between the convolutional neural network (CNN) and the scene complexity by selecting the CNN that best fit the scene complexity. The CNN trained by NS-55 was used to detect the category of the scene, define the final category of the scene according to the majority voting method, and obtain the changed scene by comparison to obtain the so-called coarse change result. Then, we created a multi-scale threshold (MST) method, which is a new method for obtaining high-quality training samples. We used the high-quality samples selected by MST to train the deep belief network to obtain the pixel-level range change detection results. By mapping coarse scene changes to range changes, we could obtain fine multi-type land-use change detection results. Experiments were conducted on the Multi-temporal Scene Wuhan dataset and aerial images of a particular area of Dapeng New District, Shenzhen, where promising results were achieved by the proposed method. This demonstrates that the proposed method is practical, easy-to-implement, and the NS-55 dataset is physically justified. The proposed method has the potential to be applied in the large scale land use fine change detection problem and qualitative and quantitative research on land use/cover change based on HR remote sensing data.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Erik""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: earth","https://doi.org/10.3390/rs12121933",NA,NA,NA

In this study, a novel CD framework based on the convolutional neural network (CNN) is proposed to not only address the aforementioned problems but also to considerably improve the level of accuracy. The proposed CNN-based CD network contains three parallel channels: the first and second channels, respectively, extract deep features on the original first- and second-time imagery and the third channel focuses on the extraction of change deep features based on differencing and staking deep features. Additionally, each channel includes three types of convolution kernels: 1D-, 2D-, and 3D-dilated-convolution.

Although all models performed better when the scope of the problem was limited to a single continent, the spatial models were more competitive than the temporal ones in this setting. These results suggest that the spatial patterns of land-use within a continent share more commonalities than the temporal patterns and the spatial patterns across continents.

They promise to be reference models that could be used to improve computationally affordable coarse‐grid global climate models across a range of climates, reducing uncertainties in regional precipitation and temperature trends. Here, machine learning of nudging tendencies as functions of column state is used to correct the physical parameterization tendencies of temperature, humidity, and optionally winds, in a real‐geography coarse‐grid model (FV3GFS with a 200 km grid) to be closer to those of a 40‐day reference simulation using X‐SHiELD, a modified version of FV3GFS with a 3 km grid. Both simulations specify the same historical sea‐surface temperature fields. This methodology builds on a prior study using a global observational analysis as the reference. The coarse‐grid model without machine learning corrections has too few clouds, causing too much daytime heating of land surfaces that creates excessive surface latent heat flux and rainfall. This bias is avoided by learning downwelling radiative flux from the fine‐grid model. The best configuration uses learned nudging tendencies for temperature and humidity but not winds. Neural nets slightly outperform random forests. Forecasts of 850 hPa temperature gain 18 hr of skill at 3–7 days leads and time‐mean precipitation patterns are improved 30% by applying the ML correction.

The geoscientific community relying mainly on physical representations may want to consider much deeper adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) instruments in the context of AI's global success and emergence of big Earth data.

Given the projected population growth, sustainable agriculture must accomplish food security while also being economically viable, socially responsible, and having the least possible impact on biodiversity and natural ecosystems. Deep learning has shown to be a sophisticated approach for big data analysis, with several successful cases in image processing, object identification, and other domains. It has lately been applied in food science and engineering. Among the issues and concerns addressed by these systems were food recognition; quality detection of fruits, vegetables, meat, and aquatic items; food supply chain; and food contamination. In precision agriculture, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a commonly used technology for estimating food quality. It is especially important when evaluating crops at different phases of harvest and postharvest. Crop disease and damage detection is a high-priority activity because some postharvest diseases or damages, such as decay, can destroy crops and produce poisons that are toxic to humans. In this paper, we use Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)-based U-Net, DeepLab, and Mask R-CNN models to detect and predict postharvest deterioration zones in stored apple fruits. Our approach is unique in that it segmented and predicted postharvest decay and nondecay zones in fruits separately. This review will focus on postharvest physiology and management of fruits and vegetables, including harvesting, handling, packing, storage, and hygiene, to reduce postharvest loss (PHL) and improve crop quality.

This task is mostly regarded as an image retrieval problem. The key underpinning this task is to design a series of deep neural networks to learn discriminative image descriptors. However, existing methods meet large performance drops under realistic weather, such as rain and fog, since they do not take the domain shift between the training data and multiple test environments into consideration. To minor this domain gap, we propose a Multiple-environment Self-adaptive Network (MuSe-Net) to dynamically adjust the domain shift caused by environmental changing. In particular, MuSe-Net employs a two-branch neural network containing one multiple-environment style extraction network and one self-adaptive feature extraction network. As the name implies, the multiple-environment style extraction network is to extract the environment-related style information, while the self-adaptive feature extraction network utilizes an adaptive modulation module to dynamically minimize the environment-related style gap. Extensive experiments on three widely-used benchmarks, i.e., University-1652, SUES-200, and CVUSA, demonstrate that the proposed MuSe-Net achieves a competitive result for geo-localization in multiple environments.

Accurate and timely estimation of corn yield is therefore essential for commodity trading and global food security. Recently, several deep learning models have been explored for corn yield forecasting. Despite success, most existing models only provide yield estimations without quantifying the uncertainty associated with the predictions. Also, the traditional deep learning approaches typically require a large training set and are easily prone to overfitting when the number of samples in the training set is relatively small. To address these limitations, in this study, we developed a county-level corn yield prediction model based on Bayesian Neural Network (BNN) using multiple data sources that are publicly available, including time-series satellite products, sequential climate observations, soil property maps, and historical corn yield records. Using preceding years since 2001 for model training, the developed BNN model achieved an average coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.77 for late-season prediction across the U.S. Corn Belt in testing years 2010–2019, and outperformed five other state-of-the-art machine learning models. Detailed evaluation in three representative testing years demonstrated that the proposed BNN model could accurately estimate corn yield not only in normal years but also in abnormal years when extreme weather events happened. Moreover, the timeliness of the prediction was evaluated within the growing season with an R2~0.75 achieved by middle August, which is about 2 months before the harvest. We also assessed the predictive uncertainty, and more than 84% of the observed yield records were successfully enveloped in the 95% confidence interval of the predictive yield distribution. Our results also showed that the uncertainty level decreased steadily as time proceeded and stabilized around early August. Uncertainties in yield prediction were mainly induced by the observation noise and also related to the interannual and seasonal variabilities of environmental stress such as heat and water stress. This paper provides a robust framework for the within-season prediction of crop yield and highlights the need to obtain a deeper understanding of the effects of environmental stress on agricultural productivity and crop yield estimation.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Erik""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: earth","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2021.112408",NA,NA,NA

The mechanisms involved are complex and intertwined, hence undermining the identification of simple adaptation levers to help improve the resilience of agricultural production.

Using machine learning models, we analyzed historical yield data since 1901 and then focus on 2018, which has experienced a multiplicity and a diversity of atypical extreme climatic conditions. Machine learning models explain up to 65% of historical yield anomalies. We find that both extremes in temperature and precipitation are associated with negative yield anomalies, but with varying impacts in different parts of Europe. In 2018, Northern and Eastern Europe experienced multiple and simultaneous crop failures—among the highest observed in recent decades. These yield losses were associated with extremely low rainfalls in combination with high temperatures between March and August 2018. However, the higher than usual yields recorded in Southern Europe—caused by favourable spring rainfall conditions—nearly offset the large decrease in Northern European crop production.

However, many of these applications require the use of a ‘bare-Earth’ DEM versus a digital surface model (DSM), the latter of which may include systematic positive biases due to tree canopies in forested areas. Critical topographic features may be obscured by these biases. Vegetation-free datasets have been created by using statistical relationships and machine learning to train on local-scale datasets (e.g., lidar) to de-bias the global-extent datasets. Recent advances in satellite platforms coupled with increased availability of computational resources and lidar reference products has allowed for a new generation of vegetation- and urban-canopy removals. One of these is the Forest And Buildings removed Copernicus DEM (FABDEM), based on the most recent and most accurate global DSM Copernicus-30. Among the more challenging landscapes to quantify surface elevations are densely forested mountain catchments, where even airborne lidar applications struggle to capture surface returns. The increasing affordability and availability of UAV-based lidar platforms have resulted in new capacity to fly modest spatial extents with unrivalled point densities. These data allow an unprecedented ability to validate global sub-canopy DEMs against representative UAV-based lidar data. In this work, the FABDEM is validated against up-scaled lidar data in a steep and forested mountain catchment considering elevation, slope, and Terrain Position Index (TPI) metrics. Comparisons of FABDEM with SRTM, MERIT, and the Copernicus-30 dataset are made. It was found that the FABDEM had a 24% reduction in elevation RMSE and a 135% reduction in bias compared to the Copernicus-30 dataset. Overall, the FABDEM provides a clear improvement over existing deforested DEM products in complex mountain topography such as the MERIT DEM.

However, mapping the extent of degradation remains challenging because of the lack of frequent high-spatial resolution satellite observations, occlusion of understory disturbances, quick recovery of leafy vegetation, and limitations of conventional reflectance-based remote sensing techniques. Here, we introduce a new approach to map forest degradation caused by logging, fire, and road construction based on deep learning (DL), henceforth called DL-DEGRAD, using very high spatial (4.77 m) and bi-annual to monthly temporal resolution of the Planet NICFI imagery. We applied DL-DEGRAD model over forests of the state of Mato Grosso in Brazil to map forest degradation with attributions from 2016 to 2021 at six-month intervals. A total of 73,744 images (256 × 256 pixels in size) were visually interpreted and manually labeled with three semantic classes (logging, fire, and roads) to train/validate a U-Net model. We predicted the three classes over the study area for all dates, producing accumulated degradation maps biannually. Estimates of accuracy and areas of degradation were performed using a probability design-based stratified random sampling approach (n = 2678 samples) and compared it with existing operational data products at the state level. DL-DEGRAD performed significantly better than all other data products in mapping logging activities (F1-score = 68.9) and forest fire (F1-score = 75.6) when compared with the Brazil's national maps (SIMEX, DETER, MapBiomas Fire) and global products (UMD-GFC, TMF, FireCCI, FireGFL, GABAM, MCD64). Pixel-based spatial comparison of degradation areas showed the highest agreement with DETER and SIMEX as Brazil official data products derived from visual interpretation of Landsat imagery. The U-Net model applied to NICFI data performed as closely to a trained human delineation of logged and burned forests, suggesting the methodology can readily scale up the mapping and monitoring of degraded forests at national to regional scales. Over the state of Mato Grosso, the combined effects of logging and fire are degrading the remaining intact forests at an average rate of 8443 km2 year−1 from 2017 to 2021.

Unrestricted use of herbicide for weed removal alters biodiversity and cause environmental pollution. Instead, identifying weed-infested regions can aid selective chemical treatment of these regions. Advances in analyzing farm images have resulted in solutions to identify weed plants. However, a majority of these approaches are based on supervised learning methods which requires huge amount of manually annotated images. As a result, these supervised approaches are economically infeasible for the individual farmer because of the wide variety of plant species being cultivated.

This weed density and distribution can be useful in a site-specific weed management system for selective treatment of infected areas using autonomous robots. In this work, the foreground vegetation pixels containing crops and weeds are first identified using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based unsupervised segmentation.

This paper develops a framework for intelligent mapping (iMap) of land cover based on state-of-the-art technologies such as cloud computing, artificial intelligence, virtual constellations, and spatio-temporal reconstruction and fusion. Under this framework, we built an automated, serverless, end-to-end data production chain and parallel mapping system based on Amazon Web Services (AWS) and produced the first 30 m global daily seamless data cubes (SDC), and annual to seasonal land cover maps for 1985–2020. The SDC was produced through a multi-source spatio-temporal data reconstruction and fusion workflow based on Landsat, MODIS, and AVHRR virtual constellations. Independent validation results show that the relative mean error of the SDC is less than 2.14%. As analysis ready data (ARD), it can lay a foundation for high-precision quantitative remote sensing information extraction. From this SDC, we produced 36-year long, 30 m resolution global land cover map data set by combining strategies of sample migration, machine learning, and spatio-temporal adjustment. The average overall accuracy of our annual land cover maps over multiple periods of time is 80% for level 1 classification and over 73% for level 2 classification (29 and 33 classes). Based on an objective validation sample consisting of FLUXNET sites, our map accuracy is 10% higher than that of existing global land cover datasets including Globeland30. Our results show that the average global land cover change rate is 0.36%/yr. Global forest decreased by 1.47 million km2 from 38.44 million km2, cropland increased by 0.84 million km2 from 12.49 million km2 and impervious surface increased by 0.48 million km2 from 0.57 million km2 during 1985– 2020.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Erik""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: earth","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2021.112364",NA,NA,NA

While their primary function is to capture and store water, they also have disproportionally large effects on biodiversity and biogeochemical cycling, with important relevance to several Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). However, the abundance and distribution of farm dams is unknown in most parts of the world. Therefore, we used artificial intelligence and remote sensing data to address this critical global information gap. Specifically, we trained a deep learning convolutional neural network (CNN) on high-definition satellite images to detect farm dams and carry out the first continental-scale assessment on density, distribution and historical trends. We found that in Australia there are 1.765 million farm dams that occupy an area larger than Rhode Island (4678 km2) and store over 20 times more water than Sydney Harbour (10,990 GL). The State of New South Wales recorded the highest number of farm dams (654,983; 37% of the total) and Victoria the highest overall density (1.73 dams km−2). We also estimated that 202,119 farm dams (11.5%) remain omitted from any maps, especially in South Australia, Western Australia and the Northern Territory. Three decades of historical records revealed an ongoing decrease in the construction rate of farm dams, from &gt;3% per annum before 2000, to ~1% after 2000, to &lt;0.05% after 2010—except in the Australian Capital Territory where rates have remained relatively high. We also found systematic trends in construction design: farm dams built in 2015 are on average 50% larger in surface area and contain 66% more water than those built in 1989. To facilitate sharing information on sustainable farm dam management with authorities, scientists, managers and local communities, we developed AusDams.org—a free interactive portal to visualise and generate statistics on the physical, environmental and ecological impacts of farm dams.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Erik""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: earth","https://doi.org/10.3390/rs13020319",NA,NA,NA

A large part of the uncertainty of sea level projections is due to uncertainty in ice sheet dynamics. At the moment, accurate quantification of the uncertainty is hindered by the cost of ice sheet computational models. In this work, we develop a hybrid approach to approximate existing ice sheet computational models at a fraction of their cost. Our approach consists of replacing the finite element model for the momentum equations for the ice velocity, the most expensive part of an ice sheet model, with a Deep Operator Network, while retaining a classic finite element discretization for the evolution of the ice thickness. We show that the resulting hybrid model is very accurate and it is an order of magnitude faster than the traditional finite element model. Further, a distinctive feature of the proposed model compared to other neural network approaches, is that it can handle high-dimensional parameter spaces (parameter fields) such as the basal friction at the bed of the glacier, and can therefore be used for generating samples for uncertainty quantification. We study the impact of hyper-parameters, number of unknowns and correlation length of the parameter distribution on the training and accuracy of the Deep Operator Network on a synthetic ice sheet model. We then target the evolution of the Humboldt glacier in Greenland and show that our hybrid model can provide accurate statistics of the glacier mass loss and can be effectively used to accelerate the quantification of uncertainty.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Erik""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: earth","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcp.2023.112428",NA,NA,NA

We have evaluated biases of downwelling shortwave radiation in the ERA5 climate reanalysis using 25 years (1995–2019) of summertime surface measurements, collected on the Research and Supply Vessel (RSV) Aurora Australis , the Research Vessel (R/V) Investigator , and at Macquarie Island. During October–March daylight hours, the ERA5 simulation of SW down exhibited large errors (mean bias = 54 W m −2 , mean absolute error = 82 W m −2 , root-mean-square error = 132 W m −2 , and R 2 = 0.71). To determine whether we could improve these statistics, we bypassed ERA5’s radiative transfer model for SW down with machine learning–based models using a number of ERA5’s gridscale meteorological variables as predictors. These models were trained and tested with the surface measurements of SW down using a 10-fold shuffle split. An extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) and a random forest–based model setup had the best performance relative to ERA5, both with a near complete reduction of the mean bias error, a decrease in the mean absolute error and root-mean-square error by 25% ± 3%, and an increase in the R 2 value of 5% ± 1% over the 10 splits. Large improvements occurred at higher latitudes and cyclone cold sectors, where ERA5 performed most poorly. We further interpret our methods using Shapley additive explanations. Our results indicate that data-driven techniques could have an important role in simulating surface radiation fluxes and in improving reanalysis products. Significance Statement Simulating the amount of sunlight reaching Earth’s surface is difficult because it relies on a good understanding of how much clouds absorb and scatter sunlight. Relative to summertime surface observations, the ERA5 reanalysis still overestimates the amount of sunlight entering the Southern Ocean. We taught some models how to predict the amount of sunlight entering the Southern Ocean using 25 years of surface observations and a small set of meteorological variables from ERA5. By bypassing the ERA5’s internal simulation of the absorption and scattering of sunlight, we can drastically reduce biases in the predicted surface shortwave radiation. Large improvements in cold sectors of cyclones and closer to Antarctica were observed in regions where many numerical models struggle to simulate the amount of incoming sunlight correctly.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Erik""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: earth","https://doi.org/10.1175/aies-d-22-0044.1",NA,NA,NA

Thus, the primary objective of the current research is to evaluate and compare the efficiency of several notable satellite sensors including Landsat-8 (L-8), Sentinel-2 (S-2), Sentinel-1 (S-1), combined Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 (S-1-2), LISS III (L-3), and LISS IV (L-4) for LCLU mapping applying random forest (RF), logit boost (LB), stochastic gradient boosting (SGB), artificial neural network (ANN), and K-nearest neighbor (KNN) models. For this purpose, 300 samples for each of the six LCLU classes have been selected based on field survey and high resolution Cartosat-3 images. The classification accuracy namely producer accuracy (PA), user accuracy (UA), overall accuracy (OA) and kappa coefficient have been calculated from the confusion matrix of the applied models. This results show the highest accuracy has been derived from the integration of S-1-2 datasets followed by S-2, L-8, L-3, L-4, and S-1. On the other hand, LB model is the most consistent and efficient in comparison with other models for all the datasets. Regarding importance of variable, SWIR band is repeatedly the most crucial factor while blue band is the least significant variable. From this comparative assessment of sensors, it has been found that high spatial and spectral resolutions along with combination of satellite datasets are required to get better accuracy rather than only high spatial resolution in regional scale mapping. The present study strongly advocates the use of combined S-1-2 data together with the application of LB model for LCLU classification. • Five sensors have been taken for evaluation and comparison in land use study. • Combined Sentinel-1-2 datasets yield the highest accuracy. • LB model applied for the first time in LCLU mapping, attains maximum precision. • SWIR band repeatedly appears as the most contributing factor for all the sensors. • The exclusion of wetland has significantly enhanced the accuracy.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Erik""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: earth","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoinf.2021.101522",NA,NA,NA

Comprehensive knowledge about these intensities is a crucial factor for sustainable decision-making in landscape policy. For meadows, the management intensity can be described by proxies such as the mowing frequency, usually, a higher number of cuts indicate higher intensities. Dense time series of medium resolution (10–30 m) remote sensing data are suitable for the detection of mowing events. However, existing studies revealed a general lack of consensus about the most appropriate input data set for a consistent and reliable mowing detection. We systematically evaluated the synergistic use of acquisitions from Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, and Landsat 8 to detect the occurrence, frequency, and date of mowing events as an indicator of grassland management intensity. Dense time series of NDVI (Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8), γ0 backscatter, backscatter cross-ratio, backscatter second-order texture metrics as well as 6-day interferometric coherence (Sentinel-1) were used as input features. All possible combinations of input features were tested to train a one-dimensional convolutional neural network, which enables enhanced exploitation of the temporal domain of the data. The evaluation was conducted on 64 meadows for an overall of 257 mowing events from 2017 to 2019 in Germany. Our results revealed that the combination of input features improves the detection performance. The highest overall accuracy was reached by a combination of NDVI, backscatter cross-ratio, and interferometric coherence with an F1-Score of 0.84. The mowing frequency was predicted with a mean absolute error of 0.38 events per year, while the date of the events was missed by 3.79 days on average. NDVI time series alone mostly underperformed in comparison to optical/SAR combinations but clearly outperformed input-sets that were solely based on SAR features.

Forest age can determine the capacity of a forest to uptake carbon from the atmosphere. However, a lack of global diagnostics that reflect the forest stage and associated disturbance regimes hampers the quantification of age-related differences in forest carbon dynamics. This study provides a new global distribution of forest age circa 2010, estimated using a machine learning approach trained with more than 40 000 plots using forest inventory, biomass and climate data. First, an evaluation against the plot-level measurements of forest age reveals that the data-driven method has a relatively good predictive capacity of classifying old-growth vs. non-old-growth (precision = 0.81 and 0.99 for old-growth and non-old-growth, respectively) forests and estimating corresponding forest age estimates (NSE = 0.6 – Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency – and RMSE = 50 years – root-mean-square error). However, there are systematic biases of overestimation in young- and underestimation in old-forest stands, respectively. Globally, we find a large variability in forest age with the old-growth forests in the tropical regions of Amazon and Congo, young forests in China, and intermediate stands in Europe. Furthermore, we find that the regions with high rates of deforestation or forest degradation (e.g. the arc of deforestation in the Amazon) are composed mainly of younger stands. Assessment of forest age in the climate space shows that the old forests are either in cold and dry regions or warm and wet regions, while young–intermediate forests span a large climatic gradient. Finally, comparing the presented forest age estimates with a series of regional products reveals differences rooted in different approaches and different in situ observations and global-scale products. Despite showing robustness in cross-validation results, additional methodological insights on further developments should as much as possible harmonize data across the different approaches. The forest age dataset presented here provides additional insights into the global distribution of forest age to better understand the global dynamics in the forest water and carbon cycles.

Due to the relatively small size of these depressional wetlands and their occurrence under forest canopy cover, it is very challenging to map their inundation status based on existing remote sensing data and traditional classification approaches. In this study, we applied a state-of-the-art U-Net semantic segmentation network to map forested wetland inundation in the Delmarva area by integrating leaf-off WorldView-3 (WV3) multispectral data with fine spatial resolution light detection and ranging (lidar) intensity and topographic data, including a digital elevation model (DEM) and topographic wetness index (TWI). Wetland inundation labels generated from lidar intensity were used for model training and validation. The wetland inundation map results were also validated using field data, and compared to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service National Wetlands Inventory (NWI) geospatial dataset and a random forest output from a previous study. Our results demonstrate that our deep learning model can accurately determine inundation status with an overall accuracy of 95% (Kappa = 0.90) compared to field data and high overlap (IoU = 70%) with lidar intensity-derived inundation labels. The integration of topographic metrics in deep learning models can improve the classification accuracy for depressional wetlands.

The rapid and accurate estimation of winter wheat yields over large areas is an important prerequisite for food security policy formulation and implementation. In most county-level yield estimation processes, multiple input data are used for yield prediction as much as possible, however, in some regions, data are more difficult to obtain, so we used the single-leaf area index (LAI) as input data for the model for yield prediction. In this study, the effects of different time steps as well as the LAI time series on the estimation results were analyzed for the properties of long short-term memory (LSTM), and multiple machine learning methods were compared with yield estimation models constructed by the LSTM networks. The results show that the accuracy of the yield estimation results using LSTM did not show an increasing trend with the increasing step size and data volume, while the yield estimation results of the LSTM were generally better than those of conventional machine learning methods, with the best R2 and RMSE results of 0.87 and 522.3 kg/ha, respectively, in the comparison between predicted and actual yields.

We present the most up-to-date map of the HFI, and document changes in human pressure during the past 20 years (2000–2019). Moreover, we demonstrate its utility as a monitoring tool for the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 15 (SDG15), ‘Life on Land’, which aims to foster sustainable development while conserving biodiversity. We identify 43 countries that are making progress toward SDG15 while also experiencing increases in their ml-HFI. We examine a subset of these in the context of conservation policies that may or may not enable continued progress toward SDG15. This has immediate policy relevance, since the majority of countries globally are not on track to achieve Goal 15 by the declared deadline of 2030.

Moderate severity disturbances affect different canopy strata and plant species, resulting in variable structural outcomes and ecological consequences. Terrestrial lidar (light detection and ranging) offers an unprecedented view of the interior arrangement and distribution of canopy elements, permitting the derivation of multidimensional measures of canopy structure that describe several canopy structural traits (CSTs) with known links to ecosystem function. We used lidar‐derived CSTs within a machine learning framework to detect and describe the structural changes that result from various disturbance agents, including moderate severity fire, ice storm damage, age‐related senescence, hemlock woolly adelgid, beech bark disease, and chronic acidification. We found that fire and ice storms primarily affected the amount and position of vegetation within canopies, while acidification, senescence, pathogen, and insect infestation altered canopy arrangement and complexity. Only two of the six disturbance agents significantly reduced leaf area, counter to common assumptions regarding many moderate severity disturbances. While findings are limited in their generalizability due to lack of replication among disturbances, they do suggest that the current limitations of standard disturbance detection methods—such as optical‐based remote sensing platforms, which are often above‐canopy perspectives—limit our ability to understand the full ecological and structural impacts of disturbance, and to evaluate the consistency of structural patterns within and among disturbance agents. A more broadly inclusive definition of ecological disturbance that incorporates multiple aspects of canopy structural change may potentially improve the modeling, detection, and prediction of functional implications of moderate severity disturbance as well as broaden our understanding of the ecological impacts of disturbance.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Erik""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: earth","https://doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.3156",NA,NA,NA

High rates of deforestation and degradation in the woodland and forest areas have made the Cerrado the second-largest source of carbon emissions in Brazil. However, data on these emissions are highly uncertain because of the spatial and temporal variability of the aboveground biomass (AGB) in this biome. Remote-sensing data combined with local vegetation inventories provide the means to quantify the AGB at large scales. Here, we quantify the spatial distribution of woody AGB in the Rio Vermelho watershed, located in the centre of the Cerrado, at a high spatial resolution of 30 metres, with a random forest (RF) machine-learning approach. We produced the first high-resolution map of the AGB for a region in the Brazilian Cerrado using a combination of vegetation inventory plots, airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data, and multispectral and radar satellite images (Landsat 8 and ALOS-2/PALSAR-2). A combination of random forest (RF) models and jackknife analyses enabled us to select the best remote-sensing variables to quantify the AGB on a large scale.

However, many organisms experience environmental conditions that differ substantially from those captured by these macroclimatic (i.e. free air) temperature grids. In forests, the tree canopy functions as a thermal insulator and buffers sub-canopy microclimatic conditions, thereby affecting biological and ecological processes. To improve the assessment of climatic conditions and climate-change-related impacts on forest-floor biodiversity and functioning, high-resolution temperature grids reflecting forest microclimates are thus urgently needed. Combining more than 1200 time series of in situ near-surface forest temperature with topographical, biological and macroclimatic variables in a machine learning model, we predicted the mean monthly offset between sub-canopy temperature at 15 cm above the surface and free-air temperature over the period 2000-2020 at a spatial resolution of 25 m across Europe. This offset was used to evaluate the difference between microclimate and macroclimate across space and seasons and finally enabled us to calculate mean annual and monthly temperatures for European forest understories. We found that sub-canopy air temperatures differ substantially from free-air temperatures, being on average 2.1°C (standard deviation ± 1.6°C) lower in summer and 2.0°C higher (±0.7°C) in winter across Europe. Additionally, our high-resolution maps expose considerable microclimatic variation within landscapes, not captured by the gridded macroclimatic products.

This study aims to evaluate the uncertainty of three each widely-used parameter estimation methods affecting plot-scale water dynamics. The study employs HYDRUS, a process-based hydrologic model, to incorporate these uncertainties and compare model predictions to measured values in a semiarid Inner Mongolia steppe, China. Soil hydraulic parameters are determined using two direct methods (laboratory-derived approach and evaporation method) and one indirect method (neural network). While each hydraulic parameter method generally simulates soil moisture dynamics, the evaporation method performed better, especially under dry conditions. This suggests that measuring the intensity properties, such as unsaturated hydraulic conductivity, with the evaporation method is crucial for reasonable soil moisture simulation. The study also demonstrates the impact of different applied boundary conditions on simulated soil moisture, specifically the partitioning of reference FAO evapotranspiration via one direct method (soil fraction cover) and two indirect methods (leaf area index and crop height). The partitioning via soil fraction cover reflected a better simulation. Additionally, the study compares the uncertainties of root water uptake function with root growth parameters and constant root depth referenced to grass and pasture, and finds no significant difference among them. Comparing three sources of uncertainty in predicting soil moisture, the study concludes that the input soil hydraulic parameter is more sensitive than evapotranspiration partitioning or representation of root water uptake function.

Land surface models (LSMs) that simulate water and energy exchanges at the land–atmosphere interface are a key component of Earth system models. The Tibetan Plateau (TP) drives the Asian monsoon through surface heating and thus plays a key role in regulating the climate system in the Northern Hemisphere. Therefore, it is vital to understand and represent well the land surface processes on the TP. After an early review that identified key issues in the understanding and modeling of land surface processes on the TP in 2009, much progress has been made in the last decade in developing new land surface schemes and supporting datasets. This review summarizes the major advances. (i) An enthalpy-based approach was adopted to enhance the description of cryosphere processes such as glacier and snow mass balance and soil freeze–thaw transition. (ii) Parameterization of the vertical mixing process was improved in lake models to ensure reasonable heat transfer to the deep water and to the near-surface atmosphere. (iii) New schemes were proposed for modeling water flow and heat transfer in soils accounting for the effects of vertical soil heterogeneity due to the presence of high soil organic matter content and dense vegetation roots in surface soils or gravel in soil columns. (iv) Supporting datasets of meteorological forcing and soil parameters were developed by integrating multi-source datasets including ground-based observations. Perspectives on the further improvement of land surface modeling on the TP are provided, including the continuous updating of supporting datasets, parameter estimation through assimilation of satellite observations, improvement of snow and lake processes, adoption of data-driven and artificial intelligence methods, and the development of an integrated LSM for the TP.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Erik""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: earth","https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-24-5745-2020",NA,NA,NA

The long-term collection of data from the Landsat missions provides some of the most valuable information for understanding the processes of global tropical forest disturbance. However, there are substantial uncertainties in the estimation of non-mechanized, small-scale (i.e., small area) clearings in tropical forests with Landsat series images. Because the appearance of small-scale openings in a tropical tree canopy are often ephemeral due to fast-growing vegetation, and because clouds are frequent in tropical regions, it is challenging for Landsat images to capture the logging signal. Moreover, the spatial resolution of Landsat images is typically too coarse to represent spatial details about small-scale clearings. In this paper, by fusing all available Landsat and Sentinel-2 images, we proposed a method to improve the tracking of small-scale tropical forest disturbance history with both fine spatial and temporal resolutions. First, yearly composited Landsat and Sentinel-2 self-referenced normalized burn ratio (rNBR) vegetation index images were calculated from all available Landsat-7/8 and Sentinel-2 scenes during 2016–2019. Second, a deep-learning based downscaling method was used to predict fine resolution (10 m) rNBR images from the annual coarse resolution (30 m) Landsat rNBR images. Third, given the baseline Landsat forest map in 2015, the generated fine-resolution Landsat rNBR images and original Sentinel-2 rNBR images were fused to produce the 10 m forest disturbance map for the period 2016–2019. From data comparison and evaluation, it was demonstrated that the deep-learning based downscaling method can produce fine-resolution Landsat rNBR images and forest disturbance maps that contain substantial spatial detail.

Notwithstanding the increasing use of UAVs in forest canopy mapping, the ultrahigh-resolution UAV imagery requires an appropriate procedure to separate the contribution of understorey from overstorey vegetation, which is complicated by the spectral similarity between the two forest components and the illumination environment. In this study, we investigated the integration of deep learning and the combined data of imagery and photogrammetric point clouds for boreal forest canopy mapping. The procedure enables the automatic creation of training sets of tree crown (overstorey) and background (understorey) data via the combination of UAV images and their associated photogrammetric point clouds and expands the applicability of deep learning models with self-supervision. Based on the UAV images with different overlap levels of 12 conifer forest plots that are categorized into “I”, “II” and “III” complexity levels according to illumination environment, we compared the self-supervised deep learning-predicted canopy maps from original images with manual delineation data and found an average intersection of union (IoU) larger than 0.9 for “complexity I” and “complexity II” plots and larger than 0.75 for “complexity III” plots. The proposed method was then compared with three classical image segmentation methods (i.e., maximum likelihood, Kmeans, and Otsu) in the plot-level crown cover estimation, showing outperformance in overstorey canopy extraction against other methods. The proposed method was also validated against wall-to-wall and pointwise crown cover estimates using UAV LiDAR and in situ digital cover photography (DCP) benchmarking methods. The results showed that the model-predicted crown cover was in line with the UAV LiDAR method (RMSE of 0.06) and deviate from the DCP method (RMSE of 0.18). We subsequently compared the new method and the commonly used UAV structure-from-motion (SfM) method at varying forward and lateral overlaps over all plots and a rugged terrain region, yielding results showing that the method-predicted crown cover was relatively insensitive to varying overlap (largest bias of less than 0.15), whereas the UAV SfM-estimated crown cover was seriously affected by overlap and decreased with decreasing overlap. In addition, canopy mapping over rugged terrain verified the merits of the new method, with no need for a detailed digital terrain model (DTM). The new method is recommended to be used in various image overlaps, illuminations, and terrains due to its robustness and high accuracy.

Forest cover in the European Alps has increased over the last century, but in recent years, these forests have experienced an increasing rate of natural disturbances by agents such as windthrow, bark beetle outbreaks, and forest fires. These disturbances pose a challenge for forest management, making it important to understand how site and stand characteristics, land use legacies and recent management influence disturbance probability. We combined a dataset of forest disturbances detected from space with in-situ forest management records, allowing us to differentiate between different types of disturbances for the Canton of Graubünden, Switzerland, in the years 2005–2018. The resulting dataset of over 28′000 attributed disturbance patches (corresponding to a disturbed forest area of ca. 23′600 ha) was combined with information on topography, forest structure, and historical forest cover. A machine-learning approach was used to investigate the non-linear and interacting relationships between potential drivers and disturbance occurrence. Natural disturbances (especially windthrow and bark beetle outbreaks) were most common at lower elevations, on shallow and south-facing slopes, and in even-aged, spruce-dominated stands with a closed canopy. Forests established in the 20th century were significantly more susceptible to natural disturbances than forests that were already present before 1880, which may be due to the uniform age and vertical structure of secondary forests, as well as legacy effects of former agricultural use. On the other hand, forest management more often took place in forests present before 1880. Management interventions (such as thinning) in turn increased the susceptibility to natural disturbances in the short term. This finding emphasizes the need to balance short-term increases in disturbance susceptibility with long-term benefits in forest resilience when planning management interventions in mountain forests. Our findings highlight the importance of considering multiple interactive drivers, including management and land-use history, for understanding forest disturbance regimes.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Erik""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: earth","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2021.118950",NA,NA,NA
"rayyan-100678227","Understanding and reducing the uncertainties of land surface energy flux partitioning within CMIP6 land models",NA,1,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"en",NA,NA,"Land surfaces dissipate energy through latent (LE) and sensible (H) heat fluxes that modulate atmospheric temperature and humidity, which in return affect land surface vegetation and soil processes. Within this two-way land-atmosphere coupling, surface energy partitioning (LE versus H) plays a central role in connecting the land and atmosphere states and fluxes. However, considerably large uncertainties still exist in earth system land models, i.e. the phase 6 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6). Further, the underlying controls from climate and biological factors on surface energy partitioning over different biome types are not well understood. In this study, we combined machine learning (ML) and causal inference models to investigate and reduce the uncertainties (i.e., parametric, structural, and forcing uncertainties) of CMIP6 simulated evaporative fraction (defined as LE / (LE + H)) across 64 FLUXNET sites that cover five major biomes. We found that CMIP6 model ensembles overestimated evaporative fraction with considerable spread at deciduous broadleaf forest, evergreen needleleaf forest, and savanna sites. Accounting for the biases from all related surface climate and biological driving variables, the CMIP6 model simulated EF could be largely improved (e.g., R between model and observed EF improved from 0.47 to 0.66), with leaf area index, vapor pressure deficit, and precipitation dominated the model improvement. Furthermore, ML-based parameterization generally showed a promising opportunity to further reduce model biases (e.g., R improved from 0.66 to 0.80) in spite of the limited improvement at evergreen broadleaf forest sites where model bias may be dominated by structural imperfection. This study provided an effective framework to understand and reduce model uncertainties in simulating land surface energy flux partitioning and, more importantly, highlighted the need of effective model structure improvement for the next generation earth system land model development.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Erik""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: earth","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2022.108920",NA,NA,NA

Recent Findings Recent studies in landscape ecology have employed advances made in remote sensing. These include the use of reliable and open datasets derived from remote sensing, the availability of new sources for freely available satellite imagery, and machine-learning image classification techniques for classifying land cover types. Remote sensing data sources and methods have been used in landscape ecology to examine landscape structure. Additionally, these data sources and methods have been used to analyze landscape function including the effects of landscape structure and landscape change on biodiversity and population dynamics. Lastly, remote sensing data sources and methods have been used to analyze historical landscape changes and to simulate future landscape changes. Summary The ongoing integration of remote sensing analyses in landscape ecology will depend on continued accessibility of free imagery from satellite sources and open-access data-analysis software, analyses spanning multiple spatial and temporal scales, and novel land cover classification techniques that produce accurate and reliable land cover data. Continuing advances in remote sensing can help to address new landscape ecology research questions, enabling analyses that incorporate information that ranges from ground-based field samples of organisms to satellite-collected remote sensing data.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Erik""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: earth","https://doi.org/10.1007/s40823-020-00054-9",NA,NA,NA

Efforts to combat illegal logging and to support sustainable value chains are hampered by a critical lack of affordable and scalable technologies for field-level inspection of wood and wood products. To meet this need we present the XyloTron, a complete, self-contained, multi-illumination, field-deployable, open-source platform for field imaging and identification of forest products at the macroscopic scale. The XyloTron platform integrates an imaging system built with off-the-shelf components, flexible illumination options with visible and UV light sources, software for camera control, and deep learning models for identification. We demonstrate the capabilities of the XyloTron platform with example applications for automatic wood and charcoal identification using visible light and human-mediated wood identification based on ultra-violet illumination and discuss applications in field imaging, metrology, and material characterization of other substrates.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Erik""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: earth","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2020.01015",NA,NA,NA

A powerful indicator for the loss of resilience is regeneration failure, that is, the inability of the prevailing tree species to regenerate after disturbance. Regeneration failure can result from the interplay among disturbance changes (e.g., larger and more frequent fires), altered climate conditions (e.g., increased drought), and functional traits (e.g., method of seed dispersal). This complexity makes projections of regeneration failure challenging. Here we applied a novel simulation approach assimilating data‐driven fire projections with vegetation responses from process modeling by means of deep neural networks. We (i) quantified the future probability of regeneration failure; (ii) identified spatial hotspots of regeneration failure; and (iii) assessed how current forest types differ in their ability to regenerate under future climate and fire. We focused on the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (2.9 × 10 6 ha of forest) in the Rocky Mountains of the USA, which has experienced large wildfires in the past and is expected to undergo drastic changes in climate and fire in the future. We simulated four climate scenarios until 2100 at a fine spatial grain (100 m). Both wildfire activity and unstocked forest area increased substantially throughout the 21st century in all simulated scenarios. By 2100, between 28% and 59% of the forested area failed to regenerate, indicating considerable loss of resilience. Areas disproportionally at risk occurred where fires are not constrained by topography and in valleys aligned with predominant winds. High‐elevation forest types not adapted to fire (i.e., Picea engelmannii – Abies lasiocarpa as well as non‐serotinous Pinus contorta var. latifolia forests) were especially vulnerable to regeneration failure. We conclude that changing climate and fire could exceed the resilience of forests in a substantial portion of Greater Yellowstone, with profound implications for carbon, biodiversity, and recreation.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Erik""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: earth","https://doi.org/10.1111/gcb.15726",NA,NA,NA

Low Power Consumption Embedded Devices (LPCED), such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and Wireless Sensor Networks, make it possible to work over great distances at a reduced cost but with limited transferable data volumes. However, data management (DM) in intelligent agriculture is still not well understood due to the fact that there are not enough scientific publications available on this. Though data management (DM) benefits are factual and substantial, many challenges must be addressed in order to fully realize the DM’s potential. The main difficulties are data integration complexities, the lack of skilled personnel and sufficient resources, inadequate infrastructure, and insignificant data warehouse architecture. This work proposes a comprehensive architecture that includes big data technologies, IoT components, and knowledge-based systems. We proposed an AI-based architecture for smart farming. This architecture called, Smart Farming Oriented Big-Data Architecture (SFOBA), is designed to guarantee the system’s durability and the data modeling in order to transform the business needs for smart farming into analytics. Furthermore, the proposed solution is built on a pre-defined big data architecture that includes an abstraction layer of the data lake that handles data quality, following a data migration strategy in order to ensure the data’s insights.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Erik""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: earth","https://doi.org/10.3390/agriculture12030329",NA,NA,NA

However, data from local observations or via ground truth is often quite limited for training DL models, especially when these models represent key socio-environmental problems, such as the monitoring of extreme, destructive climate events, biodiversity, and sudden changes in ecosystem states. Such cases, also known as small data problems, pose significant methodological challenges. This review summarises these challenges in the RS domain and the possibility of using emerging DL techniques to overcome them. We show that the small data problem is a common challenge across disciplines and scales that results in poor model generalisability and transferability. We then introduce an overview of ten promising DL techniques: transfer learning, self-supervised learning, semi-supervised learning, few-shot learning, zero-shot learning, active learning, weakly supervised learning, multitask learning, process-aware learning, and ensemble learning; we also include a validation technique known as spatial k-fold cross validation. Our particular contribution was to develop a flowchart that helps DL users select which technique to use given by answering a few questions. We hope that our review article facilitate DL applications to tackle societally important environmental problems with limited reference data.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Erik""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: earth","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jag.2023.103569",NA,NA,NA

Downward shortwave radiation (SW) and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) play crucial roles in Earth system dynamics. Spaceborne remote sensing techniques provide a unique means for mapping accurate spatiotemporally continuous SW–PAR, globally. However, any individual polar-orbiting or geostationary satellite cannot satisfy the desired high temporal resolution (sub-daily) and global coverage simultaneously, while integrating and fusing multisource data from complementary satellites/sensors is challenging because of co-registration, intercalibration, near real-time data delivery and the effects of discrepancies in orbital geometry. The Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera (EPIC) on board the Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR), launched in February 2015, offers an unprecedented possibility to bridge the gap between high temporal resolution and global coverage and characterize the diurnal cycles of SW–PAR globally. In this study, we adopted a suite of well-validated data-driven machine-learning models to generate the first global land products of SW–PAR, from June 2015 to June 2019, based on DSCOVR/EPIC data. The derived products have high temporal resolution (hourly) and medium spatial resolution (0.1∘×0.1∘), and they include estimates of the direct and diffuse components of SW–PAR. We used independently widely distributed ground station data from the Baseline Surface Radiation Network (BSRN), the Surface Radiation Budget Network (SURFRAD), NOAA's Global Monitoring Division and the U.S. Department of Energy's Atmospheric System Research (ASR) program to evaluate the performance of our products, and we further analyzed and compared the spatiotemporal characteristics of the derived products with the benchmarking Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System Synoptic (CERES) data. We found both the hourly and daily products to be consistent with ground-based observations (e.g., hourly and daily total SWs have low biases of −3.96 and −0.71 W m−2 and root-mean-square errors (RMSEs) of 103.50 and 35.40 W m−2, respectively). The developed products capture the complex spatiotemporal patterns well and accurately track substantial diurnal, monthly, and seasonal variations in SW–PAR when compared to CERES data. They provide a reliable and valuable alternative for solar photovoltaic applications worldwide and can be used to improve our understanding of the diurnal and seasonal variabilities of the terrestrial water, carbon and energy fluxes at various spatial scales.

Comprehensive mapping of vegetation distribution and dynamics in GMME is important for understanding ecosystem changes across time and space since recent reports suggest dramatic declines in wildlife populations alongside troubling reports of grassland conversion to cropland and habitat fragmentation due to increasing small-holder fencing. Here, we present the first comprehensive vegetation map of GMME at high (10-m) spatial resolution. The map consists of nine key vegetation cover types (VCTs), which were derived in a two-step process integrating data from high-resolution WorldView-3 images (1.2-m) and Sentinel-2 images using a deep-learning workflow. "", ""We evaluate the role of anthropogenic, topographic, and climatic factors in affecting the fractional cover of the identified VCTs in 2017 and their MODIS-derived browning/greening rates in the preceding 17 years at 250-m resolution. Results show that most VCTs showed a preceding greening trend in the protected land. In contrast, the semi- and unprotected land showed a general preceding greening trend in the woody-dominated cover types, while they exhibited browning trends in grass-dominated cover types. These results suggest that woody vegetation densification may be happening across much of the GMME, alongside vegetation declines within the non-woody covers in the semi- and unprotected lands. Greening and potential woody densification in GMME is positively correlated with mean annual precipitation and negatively correlated with anthropogenic pressure. "", ""Increasing woody densification across the entire GMME in the future would replace high-quality grass cover and pose a risk to the maintenance of the region's rich savanna megafauna, thus pointing to a need for further investigation using alternative data sources. The increasing availability of high-resolution remote sensing and efficient approaches for vegetation mapping will play a crucial role in monitoring conservation effectiveness as well as ecosystem dynamics due to pressures such as climate change.""]}","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2020.111953",NA,NA,NA

Most existing flux products of terrestrial carbon, water and energy components were developed individually, despite the inherently coupled processes among them. In this study, we present a new set of global daily surface downwelling shortwave radiation (SW), net radiation (Rnet), evapotranspiration (ET), gross primary productivity (GPP), terrestrial ecosystem respiration (TER) and net ecosystem exchange (NEE) datasets at 0.05° resolutions from 1982 to 2019, by improving a satellite-based and coupled-process model—the Breathing Earth System Simulator (BESS). The new version of BESS (v2.0) integrated a newly developed ecosystem respiration module, an optimality-based maximum carboxylation rate (Vcmax) model, and extended the temporal coverage of flux datasets from 1982 to 2019. We evaluated BESS products against the FLUXNET2015 dataset at the site scale, and against several remote sensing and/or machine learning products on a global scale. At the site scale, BESS products agreed well with FLUXNET measurements, capturing 84%, 53%, 65%, 51% and 31% of daily variation in Rnet, ET, GPP, TER and NEE, respectively. Interannual variation in BESS NEE showed relatively low consistency with the FLUXNET measurements, while the rest fluxes explained approximately half of the interannual variation. On a global scale, we found marked discrepancies in spatio-temporal patterns between BESS and several benchmark products. Over the period 1982–2019, BESSv2.0 estimated the mean annual global Rnet, ET, GPP, TER and NEE to be 340.97 ± 5.22 ZJ yr−1 (mean ± 1 SD), 67.67 ± 0.71 103 km3 yr−1, 125.74 ± 5.95 Pg C yr−1, 109.30 ± 3.16 Pg C yr−1, and − 16.28 ± 2.95 Pg C yr−1, respectively, with significant annual linear trends (P < 0.01) by −0.05 103 km3 yr−2 for ET, by 0.52 Pg C yr−2 for GPP, by 0.28 Pg C yr−2 for TER, and by −0.25 Pg C yr−2 for NEE. We further evaluated various coupled processes derived by BESS in terms of functional properties (i.e., Budyko relation, carbon-use efficiency, water-use efficiency, and light-use efficiency), which agreed well with FLUXNET observations, unlike the benchmark products. Overall, BESSv2.0 can serve as a set of reliable and independent products from other global satellite products, facilitating studies related to global carbon, water and energy budgets in a coupled and comprehensive manner.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Erik""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: earth","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2023.113696",NA,NA,NA

There is still a knowledge gap regarding how ecosystem carbon storage will be impacted by combined environmental and land-use factors and their spatial-temporal changes, especially in developed regions where urbanization has slowed down. This study investigated how developed regions in subtropical and tropical areas might increase carbon storage and achieve carbon neutrality, using Guangdong Province in South China as an example. Based on the sustainable development assumption, three land-management scenarios were developed and simulated for 2020-2060 using the Patch-generating Land Use Simulation model. Without considering disturbance and natural losses, carbon storage was estimated by net ecosystem productivity (NEP)-the difference between net primary productivity (NPP) and heterotrophic respiration (HR). NPP was predicted using an artificial neural network model trained by historical NPP data and 16 environmental and land-use variables. HR was predicted using soil respiration models from previous research. Based on the balance between carbon storage and emissions, we predicted the allowable fossil fuel consumption to achieve net-zero CO2 emissions in 2060. The results show that Guangdong's total carbon storage changes from 73.7 MtC in 2020 to 70.6-74.8 MtC in 2060 under different scenarios. Nonlinear relationships exist between the carbon stored and the areas of different land-use types. Topography, temperatures, and land-use configurations jointly lead to significantly varied carbon storage between croplands and between forests in space and time. Protecting and regenerating forests in subtropical areas and forest edges is more effective than afforestation in lowland tropical areas for storing carbon. Net-zero CO2 emissions rely more on reducing emissions than land management. To achieve this, the proportion of fossil energy in total energy consumption should be lowered from 75.5 % in 2020 to ~25 % in 2060.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Maria""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: earth","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.166204",NA,NA,NA
