Second, the predictors, including daily precipitation, average precipitation of past proceeding days, daily temperature, and population migration, play different roles in predicting different city’s discharges. Finally, mixed precipitation and infiltrated groundwater account for, on average, 1.6 and 10.3% of total discharges from WWTPs in the GBA.

However, the calculation speed of numerical models is slow and it is difficult to meet the needs of daily flood control and emergency. How to use artificial intelligence technology to quickly predict urban flooding is a key concern and a problem that needs to be solved. Therefore, this paper combines a numerical model with good computational accuracy and an LSTM artificial neural network model with high computational efficiency to propose a new method for fast prediction of urban flooding risk. The method uses the simulation results of the numerical model of urban flooding as the data driver to construct the LSTM neural network prediction model of each waterlogging point.

Wetlands are among some of the most challenging and complex ecosystems for water level predictions. Wetland water level prediction is vital, as wetlands have their own permissible water levels. Exceeding these water levels can cause flooding and other severe environmental damage. On the other hand, the biodiversity of the wetlands is threatened by the sudden fluctuation of water levels. Hence, early prediction of water levels benefits in mitigating most of such environmental damage. However, monitoring and predicting the water levels in wetlands worldwide have been limited owing to various constraints. This study presents the first-ever application of deep machine-learning techniques (deep neural networks) to predict the water level in an urban wetland in Sri Lanka located in its capital. Moreover, for the first time in water level prediction, it investigates two types of relationships: the traditional relationship between water levels and environmental factors, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and evaporation, and the temporal relationship between daily water levels. Two types of low load artificial neural networks (ANNs) were developed and employed to analyze two relationships which are feed forward neural networks (FFNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks, to conduct the comparison on an unbiased common ground. The LSTM has outperformed FFNN and confirmed that the temporal relationship is much more robust in predicting wetland water levels than the traditional relationship. Further, the study identified interesting relationships between prediction accuracy, data volume, ANN type, and degree of information extraction embedded in wetland data. The LSTM neural networks (NN) has achieved substantial performance, including R2 of 0.8786, mean squared error (MSE) of 0.0004, and mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.0155 compared to existing studies.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Erik""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: urban","https://doi.org/10.3390/app13042194",NA,NA,NA

However, there is a critical knowledge gap in understanding the fundamental role of AI in the development of urban water infrastructure (UWI). This review aimed to provide an analysis of how AI could be aligned to support the future development of UWI systems. Four types of AI analytics – descriptive, diagnostic, predictive and prescriptive – are discussed and linked to the improvement in the performance of UWI systems from three categories: reliability, resilience and sustainability. It is envisioned that AI technology will play a pivotal role in UWI transitioning to the future through underpinning the five development pathways: decentralisation, circular economy, greening, decarbonisation and automation. The barriers in improving AI adoption in the real world are also highlighted from four dimensions: cyber-physical infrastructure, institutional governance, social-economic systems and technological development in wider society. Embedding AI in the development pathways and tackling the barriers can ensure that AI-empowered systems are deployed in an equitable and responsible way to improve the resilience and sustainability of future UWI systems.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Erik""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: urban","https://doi.org/10.1017/wat.2023.15",NA,NA,NA

Combining the artificial neural network (ANN) and particle image velocimetry (PIV) techniques, a series of model tests have been performed to explore the relationship between strain measurements and sinkhole development and to establish a conversion model from strain data to ground settlements. It is demonstrated that the failure mechanism of the soil above the sinkhole developed from a triangle failure plane to a vertical failure plane with increasing collapse volume. Meanwhile, the soil-embedded fiber optic strain sensing nerves allowed deformation monitoring of the ground soil in real time. Furthermore, the characteristics of the measured strain profiles indicate the locations of sinkholes and the associated shear bands. Based on the strain data, the ANN model predicts the ground settlement well.

This study investigates LULC changes in Dhaka City, Bangladesh, from 2010 to 2021 and forecasts their future impacts on ES in 2030 and 2040. Landsat images were processed using the Google Earth Engine platform, and a cellular automata technique was integrated with an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for LULC mapping and prediction. Results showed an increase in built-up areas from 31% to 42% between 2010 and 2021, with a projected decrease to 34% and 32% in 2030 and 2040, respectively. Water bodies, vegetation, and agricultural land declined from 2010 to 2021 but are expected to increase in 2030 and 2040. This trend indicates a growing awareness of the need for a sustainable environment and resilience in urban ecosystem development. The value of ES is predicted to drop from $172.66 to $160.23 over thirty years (2010–2040), primarily due to the degradation of water bodies ($7.64) and agricultural land ($6.89). However, the projected increase in water bodies, vegetation, and agricultural land by 2040 suggests a potential for recovery and enhancement of these ES values through sustainable practices. Future land use policies should promote sustainable agriculture and water resource management while fostering resilience against rapid urban growth. This approach will ensure the sustainable development of urban ecosystems. This study informs future land use strategies in Dhaka City, supporting sustainable natural resource management, urban ecosystem quality management decisions, and resilience planning.

Here we provide such a review, covering water demand forecasting, leakage and contamination detection, sewer defect assessment, wastewater system state prediction, asset monitoring and urban flooding. We find that the application of deep learning techniques is still at an early stage as most studies used benchmark networks, synthetic data, laboratory or pilot systems to test the performance of deep learning methods with no practical adoption reported. Leakage detection is perhaps at the forefront of receiving practical implementation into day-to-day operation and management of urban water systems, compared with other problems reviewed.

The quest for suitable predictive models to improve realistic simulation of urban land use change has resulted in the use of several notable cellular automata calibrations.

Support vector machine is introduced as a machine learning technique to mine the impact of the explanatory variables that drive urban change. Markov chain is employed to mine the urban transition probabilities between the various urban epochs while cellular automata are used to implement the incremental discrete time steps based on neighbourhood interaction from an initial time to a future time.

Regional carbon emissions changes from land use have been affected by rapid urbanization. To dynamically assess land use change and the spatiotemporal characteristics of carbon emissions from 1990 to 2020, this study used the PLUS, grey back-propagation neural network, and related carbon emission accounting models as well as four distinct 2030 scenario simulations. According to the findings, the urbanization of the urban agglomeration on the northern slope of the Tianshan Mountains (UANSTM) developed rapidly from 1990 to 2020 with a noticeable transfer of diverse types of land. In particular, the quantity of construction land and cropland belonging to carbon source land increased by 153.271% and 55.072% respectively. Simultaneously, carbon emissions showed a trend of continuous increase and demonstrated an S-shaped curve growth, with relatively rapid growth from 2000 to 2015, that has tended to be stable in recent years. If this carbon emission trend continues, an inflection point will appear around 2028. Land use simulations for 2030 reveal that the ecological security (ES) scenario, which slows the expansion of construction land and cropland while increasing ecological land, is most likely to reduce the negative environmental consequences of urbanization. This is because higher potential peak carbon emissions per unit area that may be obtained with carbon sink land. Consequently, the ES scenario of the study region is comparable to the future urban agglomeration development model. The results provide a reference for territorial space planning and dual carbon target recommendations in the UANSTM.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Erik""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: urban","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2023.110329",NA,NA,NA

Consequently, people are becoming concerned about the state of the environment, and governments are required to produce precise projections to develop efficient preventive measures. This study makes a significant contribution to the area by modeling and predicting the CO2 emissions of vehicles using advanced artificial intelligence. The model was constructed using the CO2 emission by vehicles dataset from Kaggle, which includes different parameters, namely, vehicle class, engine size (L), cylinder transmission, fuel type, fuel consumption city (L/100 km), fuel consumption hwy (L/100 km), fuel consumption comb (L/100 km), fuel consumption comb (mpg), and CO2 emissions (g/km). To forecast the CO2 emissions produced by vehicles, a deep learning long short-term memory network (LSTM) model and a bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) model were developed. Both models are efficient. Throughout the course of the investigation, the researchers employed four statistical assessment metrics: the mean square error (MSE), the root MSE (RMSE), Pearson’s correlation coefficient (R%), and the determination coefficient (R2). Based on the datasets of experiments carried out by Kaggle, the LSTM and BiLSTM models were created and implemented. The data were arbitrarily split into two phases: training, which included 80% of the total data, and testing, which comprised 20% of the total data. The BiLSTM model performed best in terms of accuracy and achieved high prediction values for MSE and RMSE. The BiLSTM model has the greatest attainable (R2 = 93.78). In addition, R% was used to locate a connection between the dataset’s characteristics to ascertain which characteristics had the highest level of association with CO2 emissions.

The objective of this study was to adopt and test a novel structured deep-learning model for urban flood nowcasting by integrating physics-based and human-sensed features. We present a new computational modeling framework including an attention-based spatial–temporal graph convolution network (ASTGCN) model and different streams of data that are collected in real-time, preprocessed, and fed into the model to consider spatial and temporal information and dependencies that improve flood nowcasting. The novelty of the computational modeling framework is threefold: first, the model is capable of considering spatial and temporal dependencies in inundation propagation thanks to the spatial and temporal graph convolutional modules; second, it enables capturing the influence of heterogeneous temporal data streams that can signal flooding status, including physics-based features (e.g., rainfall intensity and water elevation) and human-sensed data (e.g., residents’ flood reports and fluctuations of human activity) on flood nowcasting. Third, its attention mechanism enables the model to direct its focus to the most influential features that vary dynamically and influence the flood nowcasting. We show the application of the modeling framework in the context of Harris County, Texas, as the study area and 2017 Hurricane Harvey as the flood event. Three categories of features are used for nowcasting the extent of flood inundation in different census tracts: (i) static features that capture spatial characteristics of various locations and influence their flood status similarity, (ii) physics-based dynamic features that capture changes in hydrodynamic variables, and (iii) heterogeneous human-sensed dynamic features that capture various aspects of residents’ activities that can provide information regarding flood status. Results indicate that the ASTGCN model provides superior performance for nowcasting of urban flood inundation at the census-tract level, with precision 0.808 and recall 0.891, which shows the model performs better compared with other state-of-the-art models. Moreover, ASTGCN model performance improves when heterogeneous dynamic features are added into the model that solely relies on physics-based features, which demonstrates the promise of using heterogenous human-sensed data for flood nowcasting. Given the results of the comparisons of the models, the proposed modeling framework has the potential to be more investigated when more data of historical events are available in order to develop a predictive tool to provide community responders with an enhanced prediction of the flood inundation during urban flood.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Erik""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: urban","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-32548-x",NA,NA,NA

Exploring the evolution of the mechanisms influencing urban flooding in the Guangdong Hong Kong Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) urban agglomeration is of great reference significance for formulating flood prevention and control measures and promoting high-quality development of the GBA city cluster. In this paper, we fully use the collected information on urban flooding events from 1980 to 2018 in the GBA city cluster.

Moreover, there is a close relationship between the spatiotemporal dynamics of land use/cover and changes in different ecosystem services (ESs). Using this relationship to simulate future land use scenarios is important. In this study, an LUCC dynamic analysis framework (LSTM-PLUS-FMOP) was constructed based on a deep learning time series forecasting model (LSTM), a parallelized urban land use simulation (PLUS) model and a fuzzy multiobjective programming (FMOP) model. The PLUS model was used to analyze the driving mechanism of land expansion and explore the land conversion pattern. In addition, three land conversion scenarios were established: natural land expansion (NLE), economic development priority (EDP) and regional sustainable development (RSD). The FMOP model and the relationship between LUCC and ES were used to perform a spatial simulation of land conversion. The uncertainty parameters in the model were treated by intuitionistic fuzzy numbers (IFSs). This study applied the constructed framework to the Yellow River Basin of Shaanxi Province (YRB-SX). The results showed that (1) from 2000 to 2020, the cropland area of the YRB-SX continuously decreased by 12.67 × 104 ha, while the built-up area continuously increased by 28.25 × 104 ha. The net reduction in woodland and grassland area was 13.90 × 104 ha. (2) The relative error range of land prediction using the LSTM model was 0.0003– 0.0042. This model had better accuracy than the Markov chain prediction model. (3) The cropland area decreased by 0.26% (NLE), 0.85% (EDP) and 1.68% (RSD) under the three scenarios. The built-up area increased by 25.01%, 32.76% and 14.72%, respectively. The RSD scenario followed the principles of ecological protection and spatial constraints, which mitigated the degradation of the ecosystem to some extent. This coupled simulation framework will help to obtain land allocation schemes that meet the requirements of ecological protection and provide solutions for rational land management.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Erik""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: urban","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoinf.2024.102460",NA,NA,NA

Such land-cover change generally entails negative implications for societal and environmental sustainability, particularly in South Asia, where high demographic growth and poor land-use planning combine. Analyzing historical land-use change and predicting the future trends concerning urban expansion may support more effective land-use planning and sustainable outcomes. For Nepal’s Tarai region—a populous area experiencing land-use change due to urbanization and other factors—we draw on Landsat satellite imagery to analyze historical land-use change focusing on urban expansion during 1989–2016 and predict urban expansion by 2026 and 2036 using artificial neural network (ANN) and Markov chain (MC) spatial models based on historical trends. Urban cover quadrupled since 1989, expanding by 256 km2 (460%), largely as small scattered settlements. This expansion was almost entirely at the expense of agricultural conversion (249 km2). After 2016, urban expansion is predicted to increase linearly by a further 199 km2 by 2026 and by another 165 km2 by 2036, almost all at the expense of agricultural cover.

The dynamic increase in LST results in the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect. In this study, future LULC change scenarios, seasonal (summer & winter) LST variations, and LST distribution over different LULC classes were predicted using Landsat satellite images for 1999, 2009, and 2019 in Rajshahi District, Bangladesh. Cellular Automata (CA) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) procedures were used to predict the LULC changes and seasonal LST variations for 2029 and 2039. In addition, Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) and Key Informants Interviews (KIIs) were conducted to identify the possible impacts of LULC change, LST shifts, and climate change on agricultural productivity and developed a sustainable land use management plan for the study area. Validation of the CA model demonstrated an excellent accuracy with a kappa value of 0.82. Similarly, the ANN model's validation using Mean Square Error (0.523 and 0.796 for summer) and Correlation coefficient (0.6023 and 0.831 for winter) values demonstrated a good prediction accuracy. The LULC prediction result indicated that the built-up area will be expanded by 58.03 km2 and 79.90 km2, respectively, from 2019 to 2029 and 2039. The predicted seasonal LST indicated that in 2029 and 2039, more than 23.30 % and 50.46 % of the summer and 3.02 % and 13.02 % of the winter seasons will likely be experienced LSTs greater than 35 °C. The results of public participation exposed that changes in LULC classes, variations in LST, and climate change significantly impact the regional biodiversity (loss of farmland and water bodies), reduce agricultural productivity, and increase extreme weather events (flood, heavy rainfall, and cold/warm temperature).

But what happens to the provision of ecosystem services when green spaces themselves are compromised by heat and drought? In this study, we assessed the air temperature regulation by two structurally distinct inner-city parks in Leipzig, Germany, that were strongly affected by the heat and drought periods in 2018 and 2019. We used a dense network of in-situ measurements and machine learning to create spatially explicit maps of air temperature distribution at a fine-scale neighborhood level for a 24 h period during the summer heat wave in 2019. The results showed that the larger, tree-dominated park could maintain spaces of relative coolness at any time, whereas the other rather open, grass-dominated park was strongly heated during the daytime but provided relatively cool air during the night and early morning. We found a maximum spatially averaged cooling effect of green spaces versus the built-up surroundings of 1.1°C in the morning. In the afternoon, however, when air temperatures peaked at nearly 40°C, cooling was limited to shaded areas, leading to average differences between green spaces and built-up surroundings below 1°C. Our spatially explicit maps indicated that the “cooling distances” of green spaces, i.e., cooling effects that extend beyond the boundaries of a park, are negligible during dry and hot conditions. We conclude that vegetation structure, particularly the configuration of trees, is key to designing heat and drought-resilient green spaces and thus maintaining ecosystem service provision under the challenges of climate change. Urban planning needs to account for larger green spaces that are complemented by decentralized, well-distributed small-scale green infrastructure that intersperses the built infrastructure such as roadside greenery and vegetated backyards.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Erik""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: urban","https://doi.org/10.3389/fenvs.2022.849965",NA,NA,NA

With the increased frequency of climate change-induced extreme weathers, the numbers of flooding and heavy rain-induced slope failures/landslides in urban areas has increased in recent years. There are both engineering methods to prevent their occurrence, and more effectively early prediction and warning systems to mitigate the resulting damage. However, earthquakes still cannot be predicted to an extent that is sufficient to avoid damage, and developing and adopting structures that are resilient against earthquakes, that is, structures featuring earthquake resistance, vibration damping, and seismic isolation, are essential tasks for sustainable city development.

In order to prevent flood occurrence and mitigate the subsequent aftermath, urban water managers aim to predict precipitation characteristics, including peak intensity, arrival time and duration, so that they can further warn inhabitants in risky areas and take emergency actions when forecasting a pluvial flood. Previous studies that dealt with the prediction of urban pluvial flooding are mainly based on hydrological or hydraulic models, requiring a large volume of data for simulation accuracy. These methods are computationally expensive. Using a rainfall threshold to predict flooding based on a data-driven approach can decrease the computational complexity to a great extent. In order to prepare cities for frequent pluvial flood events – especially in the future climate – this paper uses a rainfall threshold for classifying flood vs. non-flood events, based on machine learning (ML) approaches, applied to a case study of Shenzhen city in China. In doing so, ML models can determine several rainfall threshold lines projected in a plane spanned by two principal components, which provides a binary result (flood or no flood). Compared to the conventional critical rainfall curve, the proposed models, especially the subspace discriminant analysis, can classify flooding and non-flooding by different combinations of multiple-resolution rainfall intensities, greatly raising the accuracy to 96.5% and lowering the false alert rate to 25%. Compared to the conventional model, the critical indices of accuracy and true positive rate (TPR) were 5%-15% higher in ML models. Such models are applicable to other urban catchments as well.

It is still challenging to extract accurate vegetation covers from aerial imagery using traditional classification approaches, because urban vegetation categories have complex spatial structures and similar spectral properties. Deep neural networks (DNNs) have shown a significant improvement in remote sensing image classification outcomes during the last few years. These methods are promising in this domain, yet unreliable for various reasons, such as the use of irrelevant descriptor features in the building of the models and lack of quality in the labeled image. Explainable AI (XAI) can help us gain insight into these limits and, as a result, adjust the training dataset and model as needed. Thus, in this work, we explain how an explanation model called Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) can be utilized for interpreting the output of the DNN model that is designed for classifying vegetation covers. We want to not only produce high-quality vegetation maps, but also rank the input parameters and select appropriate features for classification. Therefore, we test our method on vegetation mapping from aerial imagery based on spectral and textural features. Texture features can help overcome the limitations of poor spectral resolution in aerial imagery for vegetation mapping. The model was capable of obtaining an overall accuracy (OA) of 94.44% for vegetation cover mapping. The conclusions derived from SHAP plots demonstrate the high contribution of features, such as Hue, Brightness, GLCM_Dissimilarity, GLCM_Homogeneity, and GLCM_Mean to the output of the proposed model for vegetation mapping. Therefore, the study indicates that existing vegetation mapping strategies based only on spectral characteristics are insufficient to appropriately classify vegetation covers.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Erik""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: urban","https://doi.org/10.3390/s21144738",NA,NA,NA

A total of 2,574 documents were collected from the Web of Science database and compartmentalized into three sub-periods: 1991–2015, 2016–2019, and 2020–2021. The results show that environmentally sustainable smart cities are a rapidly growing trend that markedly escalated during the second and third periods—due to the acceleration of the digitalization and decarbonization agendas—thanks to COVID-19 and the rapid advancement of data-driven technologies. The analysis also reveals that, while the overall priority research topics have been dynamic over time—some AI models and techniques and environmental sustainability areas have received more attention than others. The evidence synthesized indicates that the increasing criticism of the fragmentation of smart cities and sustainable cities, the widespread diffusion of the SDGs agenda, and the dominance of advanced ICT have significantly impacted the materialization of environmentally sustainable smart cities, thereby influencing the landscape and dynamics of smart cities. It also suggests that the convergence of AI, IoT, and Big Data technologies provides new approaches to tackling the challenges of environmental sustainability. However, these technologies involve environmental costs and pose ethical risks and regulatory conundrums. The findings can inform scholars and practitioners of the emerging data-driven technology solutions of smart cities, as well as assist policymakers in designing and implementing responsive environmental policies.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Erik""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: urban","https://doi.org/10.1186/s42162-023-00259-2",NA,NA,NA

The i-Tree Eco software application can be used to estimate regulating ecosystem services provided by urban forests. However, existing municipal tree inventories may not contain data necessary for running i-Tree Eco and manual field surveys are costly and time consuming. Using a tree inventory of Oslo, Norway, as an example, we demonstrate the potential of geospatial and machine learning methods to supplement missing and incomplete i-Tree Eco attributes in existing municipal inventories for the purpose of rapid low-cost urban ecosystem accounting. We correlate manually surveyed stem diameter and crown dimensions derived from airborne laser scanning imagery to complete most structural attributes. We then use auxiliary spatial datasets to derive missing attributes of trees’ spatial context and include differentiation of air pollution levels. The integration of Oslo’s tree inventory with available spatial data increases the proportion of records suitable for i-Tree Eco analysis from 19 % to 54 %. Furthermore, we illustrate how machine learning with Bayesian networks can be used to extrapolate i-Tree Eco outputs and infer the value of the entire municipal inventory. We find the expected total asset value of municipal trees in Oslo to be 38.5–43.4 million USD, depending on different modelling assumptions. We argue that there is a potential for greater use of geospatial methods in compiling information for valuation of urban tree inventories, especially when assessing location-specific tree characteristics, and for more spatially sensitive scaling methods for determining asset values of urban forests for the purpose of awareness-raising. However, given the available data in our case, we question the accuracy of values inferred by Bayesian networks in relation to the purposes of ecosystem accounting and tree compensation valuation.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Erik""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: urban","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ufug.2020.126801",NA,NA,NA

An increase in frequency and intensity of heavy rainfall events and an ongoing urbanization may further increase the risk of pluvial flooding in many urban areas. Currently, warnings for pluvial floods are mostly limited to information on rainfall intensities and durations over larger areas, which is often not detailed enough to effectively protect people and goods. We present a proof‐of‐concept for an impact‐based forecasting system for pluvial floods. Using a model chain consisting of a rainfall forecast, an inundation, a contaminant transport and a damage model, we are able to provide predictions for the expected rainfall, the inundated areas, spreading of potential contamination and the expected damage to residential buildings. We use a neural network‐based inundation model, which significantly reduces the computation time of the model chain. To demonstrate the feasibility, we perform a hindcast of a recent pluvial flood event in an urban area in Germany. The required spatio‐temporal accuracy of rainfall forecasts is still a major challenge, but our results show that reliable impact‐based warnings can be forecasts are available up to 5 min before the peak of an extreme rainfall event.

This requires reducing GHG emissions from grid-energy consumption (Scope 2 emissions), which is straightforward; however, it also requires reducing Scope 1 emissions, which include nitrous oxide and methane emissions, predominantly from wastewater handling and treatment. The pathways and factors leading to biological nitrous oxide and methane formation and emissions from wastewater are highly complex and site-specific. Good emission factors for estimating the Scope 1 emissions are lacking, water utilities have little experience in directly measuring these emissions, and the mathematical modelling of these emissions is challenging. Therefore, this book aims to help the water sector address the Scope 1 emissions by breaking down their pathways and influencing factors, and providing guidance on both the use of emission factors, and performing direct measurements of nitrous oxide and methane emissions from sewers and wastewater treatment plants. The book also dives into the mathematical modelling for predicting these emissions and provides guidance on the use of different mathematical models based upon your conditions, as well as an introduction to alternative modelling methods, including metabolic, data-driven, and AI methods. Finally, the book includes guidance on using the modelling tools for assessing different operating strategies and identifying promising mitigation actions.

Sustainable urban drainage systems (SuDS) are decentralized stormwater management practices that mimic natural drainage processes. The hydrological processes of SuDS are often modeled using process-based models. However, it can require considerable effort to set up these models. This study thus proposes a machine learning (ML) method to directly learn the statistical correlations between the hydrological responses of SuDS and the forcing variables at sub-hourly timescales from observation data. The proposed methods are applied to two SuDS catchments with different sizes, SuDS practice types, and data availabilities in the USA for discharge prediction. The resulting models have high prediction accuracies (Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency, NSE, &gt;0.70). ML explanation methods are then employed to derive the basis of each ML prediction, based on which the hydrological processes being modeled are then inferred. The physical realism of the inferred hydrological processes is then compared to that would be expected based on the domain-specific knowledge of the system being modeled. The inferred processes of some models, however, are found to be physically implausible. For instance, negative contributions of rainfall to runoff have been identified in some models. This study further empirically shows that an ML model's ability to provide accurate predictions can be uncorrelated with its ability to offer plausible explanations to the physical processes being modeled. Finally, this study provides a high-level overview of the practices of inferring physical processes from the ML modeling results and shows both conceptually and empirically that large uncertainty exists in every step of the inference processes. In summary, this study shows that ML methods are a useful tool for predicting the hydrological responses of SuDS catchments, and the hydrological processes inferred from modeling results should be interpreted cautiously due to the existence of large uncertainty in the inference processes.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Maria""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: urban","https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-25-5839-2021",NA,NA,NA

The green and blue infrastructure (GBI) in urban areas appears to be an important measure to enhance the economic benefits of the urban environment, but related research is still limited. In this article, we combine big data and machine learning methods to investigate the economic benefits of GBI in the city of Wuhan in Hubei Province. Specifically, the daily travel routes of citizens are analyzed at two scale levels (the housing and neighborhood scales); in our analysis, we start with the structural attributes of citizens' own houses, move on to the city street views that citizens walk through, pass by the locational amenities where citizens spend their leisure time, and arrive at open spaces located throughout the city. The above trajectory dataset includes 30 variables, which were used as the input into ordinary least squares (OLS), geographically weighted regression (GWR), and multiscale GWR (MGWR). The results show that MGWR (adj. R2 = 0.524 at the housing scale, while adj. R2 = 0.869 at the neighborhood scale) with all control variables and the GBI attribute variables have the highest goodness of fit: the closer GBI is to urban residents, the higher the economic benefits are regardless of the area; and the higher the street visible green rate is, the greater the economic benefits are. Therefore, urban areas can appropriately increase the number of well-designed small GBIs located near urban residents. Our research provides insights into how big data and machine learning can be employed in frameworks to characterize the economic benefits of GBI and can be applied in other countries and regions.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Maria""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: urban","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.128321",NA,NA,NA

This phenomenon is known as platformization, which has in turn given rise to the phenomena of platform society, where platforms have permeated the core of urban societies. A recent manifestation of platformization is the Metaverse, a global platform project launched by Meta (formerly Facebook) as a globally operating platform company. The Metaverse represents an idea of a hypothetical “parallel virtual world” that incarnate ways of living and working in virtual cities as an alternative to smart cities of the future. Indeed, with emerging innovative technologies—such as Artificial Intelligence, Big Data, the IoT, and Digital Twins—providing rich datasets and advanced computational understandings of human behavior, the Metaverse has the potential to redefine city designing activities and service provisioning towards increasing urban efficiencies, accountabilities, and quality performance. However, there still remain ethical, human, social, and cultural concerns as to the Metaverse’s influence upon the quality of human social interactions and its prospective scope in reconstructing the quality of urban life. This paper undertakes an upper-level literature review of the area of the Metaverse from a broader perspective. Further, it maps the emerging products and services of the Metaverse, and explores their potential contributions to smart cities with respect to their virtual incarnation, with a particular focus on the environmental, economic, and social goals of sustainability. This study may help urban policy makers to better understand the opportunities and implications of the Metaverse upon tech-mediated practices and applied urban agendas, as well as assess the positives and negatives of this techno-urban vision. This paper also offers thoughts regarding the argument that the Metaverse has disruptive and substantive effects on forms of reconstructing reality in an increasingly platformized urban society.

This paper presents a deep-learning-based framework for a fully automated extraction of built-up areas at a spatial resolution of 10 m from a global composite of Sentinel-2 imagery. A multi-neuro modeling methodology building on a simple Convolution Neural Networks architecture for pixel-wise image classification of built-up areas is developed.

Flood hazard maps were created using three state-of-the-art machine learning methods (support vector machine, random forest, and boosted regression tree). The metadata supporting our analysis comprises 218 flood inundation points and a variety of derived factors: slope aspect, elevation, slope angle, rainfall, distance to streets, distance to rivers, land use/land cover, distance to urban drainages, urban drainage density, and curve number. We then employed the TOPSIS decision-making tool for urban flood vulnerability analysis, which is based on socio-economic factors such as building density, population density, building history, and socio-economic conditions. Finally, we derived an urban flood risk map for Jiroft based on flood hazard and vulnerability maps. Of the three models tested, the random forest model yielded the most accurate map. The results indicate that urban drainage density and distance to urban drainages are the most important factors in urban flood hazard modeling. As might be expected, areas with a high or very high population density are most vulnerable to flooding.

In this scenario, urban water supply is under unprecedented pressure, and the sustainable management of the water demand, in terms of practices including economic, social, environmental, production, and other fields, is becoming a must for utility managers and policy makers. To help tackle these challenges, this paper presents a well-timed review of predictive methods for short-term water demand. For this purpose, over 100 articles were selected from the articles published in water demand forecasting from 2010 to 2021 and classified upon the methods they use. In principle, the results show that traditional time series methods and artificial neural networks are among the most widely used methods in the literature, used in 25% and 20% of the articles in this review. However, the ultimate goal of the current work goes further, providing a comprehensive guideline for engineers and practitioners on selecting a forecasting method to use among the plethora of available options.

Three distinct themes are inspected and interrelated to develop awareness for an urbanizing world: internal urban design and innovation, technical transition, and geopolitical change. Data were collected on the use of energy in cities and, by extension, nation states over the last 30 years. The urban population boom continues to pressure the energy dimension with heavily weighted impacts on less developed regions. Sustainable urban energy will need to reduce resource inputs and environmental impacts and decouple economic growth from energy consumption. Fossil fuels continue to be the preferred method of energy for cities; however, an increased understanding is emerging that sustainable energy forms can be implemented as alternatives. Key to this transition will be the will to invest in renewables (i.e., solar, wind, hydro, tidal, geothermal, and biomass), efficient infrastructure, and smart eco-city designs. This essay elucidates how the technical transition of energy-friendly technologies focuses on understanding the changes in the energy mix from non-renewable to renewable. Smart electricity storage grids with artificial intelligence can operate internationally and alleviate some geopolitical barriers. Energy politics is shown to be a problematic hurdle with case research examples specific to Central and Eastern Europe.

Yet, PDR is the most poorly understood phase of the disaster management cycle and can take years or even decades. The physical aspects of the recovery are relatively easy to monitor and evaluate using, e.g. geospatial remote sensing data compared to functional assessments that include social and economic processes. Therefore, there is a need to explore the impacts of different dimensions of the recovery, including individual behaviour and their interactions with socio-economic institutions. In this study, we develop an agent-based model to simulate and explore the PDR process in urban areas of Tacloban, the Philippines devastated by Typhoon Haiyan in 2013. Formal and informal (slum) sector households are differentiated in the model to explore their resilience and different recovery patterns. Machine learning-derived land use maps are extracted from remote sensing images for pre- and post-disaster and are used to provide information on physical recovery. We use the empirical model to evaluate two realistic policy scenarios: the construction of relocation sites after a disaster and the investments in improving employment options. We find that the speed of the recovery of the slum dwellers is higher than formal sector households due to the quick reconstruction of slums and the availability of low-income jobs in the first months after the disaster. Finally, the results reveal that the households' commuting distance to their workplaces is one of the critical factors in households' decision to relocate after a disaster.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Maria""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: urban","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijdrr.2021.102285",NA,NA,NA

The PM concentration in the air causes haze and affects the lungs and the heart, leading to reduced visibility, allergic reactions, pneumonia, asthma, cardiopulmonary diseases, lung cancer, and even death. In this context, the development of systems for monitoring, forecasting, and controlling emissions plays an important role. The literature about forecasting systems based on Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) ensembles has been highlighted regarding statistical accuracy and efficiency. In this article, trainable and non-trainable combination methods are used for PM10 and PM2.5 (particles with an aerodynamic diameter less than 10 and 2.5 micrometers, respectively) time series forecasting for eight different locations, in Finland and Brazil, for different periods. Trainable ensembles based on ANNs, linear regression, and Copulas are compared with non-trainable combinations (mean and median), single ANNs, and linear statistical approaches. Different models are considered so far, including Autoregressive model (AR), Autoregressive and Moving Average Model (ARMA), Infinite Impulse Response Filters (IIR), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Radial Basis Function Networks (RBF), Extreme Learning Machines (ELM), Echo State Networks (ESN), and Adaptive Network Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS). The use of ANNs ensembles, mainly combined with MLP, leads to a better one step ahead forecasting performance. The use of robust air pollution forecasting tools is prime to assist governments in managing air pollution issues like hospital collapse during adverse air quality situations.

To tackle this issue, we introduce Roofpedia, a set of three contributions: (i) automatic mapping of relevant urban roof typology from satellite imagery; (ii) an open roof registry mapping the spatial distribution and area of solar and green roofs of more than one million buildings across 17 cities; and (iii) the Roofpedia Index, a derivative of the registry, to benchmark the cities by the extent of sustainable roofscape in term of solar and green roof penetration. This project, partly inspired by its street greenery counterpart 'Treepedia', is made possible by a multi-step pipeline that combines deep learning and geospatial techniques, demonstrating the feasibility of an automated methodology that generalises successfully across cities with an accuracy of detecting sustainable roofs of up to 100% in some cities. We offer our results as an interactive map and open dataset so that our work could aid researchers, local governments, and the public to uncover the pattern of sustainable rooftops across cities, track and monitor the current use of rooftops, complement studies on their potential, evaluate the effectiveness of existing incentives, verify the use of subsidies and fulfilment of climate pledges, estimate carbon offset capacities of cities, and ultimately support better policies and strategies to increase the adoption of instruments contributing to the sustainable development of cities.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Maria""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: urban","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.landurbplan.2021.104167",NA,NA,NA

This is widespread due to global urbanization. Considering nature and society in urban planning, we have established an evaluation system for urban green space construction to ensure urban development residents’ needs while considering natural resource distribution. This is to alleviate the contradiction of urban land use and realize the city’s sustainable development. Taking the Fengdong New City, Xixian New Area as an example, the study used seven indicators to construct an ecological source evaluation system, four types of factors to identify ecological corridors and ecological nodes using the minimum cumulative resistance model, and a Back Propagation neural network to determine the weight of the evaluation system, constructing an urban green space ecological network. We comprehensively analyzed and retained 11 ecological source areas, identified 18 ecological corridors, and integrated and selected 13 ecological nodes. We found that the area under the influence of ecosystem functions is 12.56 km2, under the influence of ecological demands is 1.40 km2, and after comprehensive consideration is 22.88 km2. Based on the results, this paper concludes that protecting, excavating, and developing various urban greening factors do not conflict with meeting the residents’ ecological needs. With consideration of urban greening factors, cities can achieve green and sustainable development. We also found that the BP neural network objectively calculates and analyzes the evaluation factors, corrects the distribution value of each factor, and ensures the validity and practicability of the weights. The main innovation of this study lies in the quantitative analysis and spatial expression of residents’ demand for ecological land and the positive and negative aspects of disturbance.

Background and Objectives: Green infrastructure and trees in particular play a key role in mitigating the urban heat island (UHI) effect. A more detailed understanding of the cooling potential of urban trees and specific tree traits is necessary to support tree management decisions for cooling our progressively hot cities. The goal of this study was to identify the influence and importance of various tree traits and site conditions. Materials and Methods: Surface temperature, air temperature at 1.1 m and at tree crown height, as well as wet bulb globe-temperature of shaded and fully sun-exposed reference areas, were used to study the cooling effect of seven different urban tree species. For all 100 individuals, tree height, crown base, trunk circumference, crown volume, crown area, leaf area index (LAI) and leaf area density (LAD) were measured. Measurements were conducted in the cities of Dresden, Salzburg, Szeged, and Vienna as representatives for middle European cities in different climate zones. Results: Beside site conditions, tree species, height, height of crown base, as well as trunk circumference, have a great influence on the cooling effect for city dwellers.

We use panoramic photos of rivers in central Beijing and image semantic segmentation technology to extract physical features of landscape composition. We use an ordinary least squares (OLS) regression model and a random forest (RF) model to develop a predictive model for riverside aesthetic quality. The RF model was found to be the most accurate for predicting the aesthetic quality score of the channelized riverside. Trees and bridges are the most important input factors that affect the output score of the RF model. Trees are positively correlated with aesthetic quality, while bridges are negatively correlated. In practice, this model can be used for batch evaluation and aesthetic quality prediction of urban canalized riverside landscapes to help practitioners improve analysis efficiency and guide the management and planning of riverside landscapes.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Maria""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: urban","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.133066",NA,NA,NA

Preserving, restoring and expanding UGS require sustainable management of green and blue water resources to fulfil evapotranspiration (ET) demand for green plant cover. The heterogeneity of UGS with high variation in their microclimates and irrigation practices builds up the complexity of ET estimation. In oversized UGS, areas too large to be measured with in situ ET methods, remote sensing (RS) approaches of ET measurement have the potential to estimate the actual ET. Often in situ approaches are not feasible or too expensive. We studied the effects of spatial resolution using different satellite images, with high‐, medium‐ and coarse‐spatial resolutions, on the greenness and ET of UGS using Vegetation Indices (VIs) and VI‐based ET, over a 780‐ha urban park in Adelaide, Australia. We validated ET with the ground‐based ET method of Soil Water Balance. Three sets of imagery from WorldView2, Landsat and MODIS, and three VIs including the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and Enhanced Vegetation Index 2 (EVI2), were used to assess long‐term changes of VIs and ET calculated from the different imagery acquired for this study (2011–2018). We found high correspondence between ET‐MODIS and ET‐Landsat (R 2 &gt; 0.99 for all VIs). Landsat‐VIs captured the seasonal changes of greenness better than MODIS‐VIs. We used artificial neural network (ANN) to relate the RS‐ET and ground data, and ET‐MODIS (EVI2) showed the highest correlation (R 2 = 0.95 and MSE =0.01 for validation). We found a strong relationship between RS‐ET and in situ measurements, even though it was not explicable by simple regressions; black box models helped us to explore their correlation.

(2) The urbanization index had a negative effect on the habitat quality, but the negative effect have improved after 2000, reflecting the positive effect of policies such as ""ecological civilization construction"" (3) The implementation degree of ecological civilization varies greatly among cities in the study area: Shenzhen, Dongguan, Foshan, and Zhongshan have the best level of green development. These results reflect the positive role of policies in the prevention of damage to habitat quality caused by economic development and provide a reference for the formulation of sustainable urban development policies with spatial differences.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Maria""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: urban","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-92916-3",NA,NA,NA

Yet, conventional studies on human perception of urban landscape are largely dependent on individual experience, which may restrict the co-production of knowledge that can be operationalized across spatial scales and sectors. In this study, we mapped human perception of urban landscape in Shanghai by leveraging an advanced deep-learning approach and street-view images. Specifically, the ResNet50 model was employed to map four critical perceptions, i.e., security, depression, vitality, and aesthetic, at parcel level. We further explored the relationship between human perception and land-use types. Our results show that highly urbanized area (Puxi district encompassed by the Inner Ring Road) is perceived as more secure and vital, but more depressing. Besides, human perception varies substantially across different land-use types, among which administrative and service land is favored with regard to all the four perception types. This study advances our understanding of urban landscape through the lens of human perception, and provides nuanced insights into steering human settlement towards sustainability by strategically promoting mixed land use.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Maria""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: urban","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jag.2022.102886",NA,NA,NA

This paper has selected Chengdu-Chongqing region of China as the research object, which suffers from severe air pollution and has been actively involved in air pollution control in recent years to achieve sustainable development. Based on the historical data of 16 cities in this region from January 2015 to November 2019 on six major air pollutants, this paper has first conducted evaluation on the monthly air quality of these cities within the research period by using Principal Component Analysis and the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to an Ideal Solution. Based on that, this paper has adopted the Long Short-Term Memory neural network model in deep learning to forecast the monthly air quality of various cities from December 2019 to November 2020. The aims of this paper are to enrich existing literature on air pollution control, and provide a novel scientific tool for design and formulation of air pollution control policies by innovatively integrating commonly used evaluation models and deep learning forecast methods. According to the research results, in terms of historical evaluation, the air quality of cities in the Chengdu-Chongqing region was generally moving in the same trend in the research period, with distinct characteristics of cyclicity and convergence. Year- on-year speaking, the effectiveness of air pollution control in various cities has shown a visible improvement trend. For example, Ya’an’s lowest air quality evaluation score has improved from 0.3494 in 2015 to 0.4504 in 2019; Zigong’s lowest air quality score has also risen from 0.4160 in 2015 to 0.6429 in 2019. Based on the above historical evaluation and deep learning forecast results, this paper has proposed relevant policy recommendations for air pollution control in the Chengdu-Chongqing region.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Maria""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: urban","https://doi.org/10.3390/su13010206",NA,NA,NA

As the rapid spread of COVID-19 becoming a global pandemic disrupted urban mobility due to government-imposed lockdowns and the heightened fear of infection in crowded spaces, populations were increasingly less likely to use public transportation and instead shifted toward alternative transport systems, including BSS. In this study, we use probabilistic machine learning in a quasi-experimental research design to identify how the relevance of a comprehensive set of factors to predict the use of Bicing (the BSS in Barcelona) may have changed as COVID-19 unfolded. We unpack the key factors in predicting the use of Bicing, uncovering evidence of increasing bike-related built infrastructure (e.g., tactical urbanism), trip distance, and the income levels of neighborhoods as the most relevant predictors. Moreover, we find that the relevance of the factors in predicting Bicing usage has generally decreased during the global pandemic, suggesting altered societal behavior. Our study enhances the understanding of BSS and societal behavior, which can have important implications for developing resilient programs for cities to adopt sustainable practices through transport policy, infrastructure planning, and urban development.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Maria""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: urban","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scs.2022.103929",NA,NA,NA

For some cities and regions, these data exist in detailed 3D models based on real-world measurements. However, they are still expensive to build and maintain, a significant challenge, especially for small and medium-sized cities that are home to the majority of the European population. New methods are needed to estimate relevant building stock characteristics reliably and cost-effectively. Here, we present a machine learning based method for predicting building heights, which is based only on open-access geospatial data on urban form, such as building footprints and street networks. The method allows to predict building heights for regions where no dedicated 3D models exist currently. We train our model using building data from four European countries (France, Italy, the Netherlands, and Germany) and find that the morphology of the urban fabric surrounding a given building is highly predictive of the height of the building. A test on the German state of Brandenburg shows that our model predicts building heights with an average error well below the typical floor height (about 2.5 m), without having access to training data from Germany. Furthermore, we show that even a small amount of local height data obtained by citizens substantially improves the prediction accuracy. Our results illustrate the possibility of predicting missing data on urban infrastructure; they also underline the value of open government data and volunteered geographic information for scientific applications, such as contextual but scalable strategies to mitigate climate change.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Maria""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: urban","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0242010",NA,NA,NA

The current policy framework to ensure the quality of life of inhabitants leaving no one behind, leads decision-makers to seek better-informed choices for the sustainable planning of urban areas. Thus, a better understanding between the spatial structure of cities and their socio-economic level is of crucial relevance. Accordingly, the purpose of this paper is to quantify this two-way relationship. Therefore, we measured spatial patterns of 31 cities in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. We rely on spatial pattern metrics derived from a Local Climate Zone classification obtained by fusing remote sensing and open GIS data with a machine learning approach. Based upon the data, we quantified the relationship between spatial pattern metrics and socio-economic variables related to 'education', 'health', 'living conditions', 'labor', and 'transport' by means of multiple linear regression models, explaining the variability of the socio-economic variables from 43% up to 82%. Additionally, we grouped cities according to their level of 'quality of life' using the socio-economic variables, and found that the spatial pattern of low-dense built-up types was different among socio-economic groups.

A data-driven approach is considered, using artificial intelligence and methods to minimize cascading effects and the destruction of failing critical infrastructures and their components (at a city level). The proposed approach allows rapid recovery of infrastructures’ service performance levels after disasters while keeping the coverage of the assessment of risks, prevention, detection, response, and mitigation of consequences. The proposed approach has the originality and the practical implication of providing a decision support system that handles the infrastructures that will support the city disaster management system—make the city prepare, adapt, absorb, respond, and recover from disasters by taking advantage of the interconnections between its various critical infrastructures to increase the overall resilience capacity.

The manuscript strives to leverage the power of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques applied to Twitter messages using supervised learning to achieve real-time automated event detection in smart cities. A semantic-based taxonomy of risks is devised to discover and analyse associated events from data streams, with a view to: (i) read and process, in real-time, published texts (ii) classify each text into one representative real-world category (iii) assign a citizen satisfaction value to each event. To select the language processing models striking the best balance between accuracy and processing speed, we conducted a pre-emptive evaluation, comparing several baseline language models formerly employed by researchers for event classification. A heuristic analysis of several smart cities and community initiatives was conducted, with a view to define real-world scenarios as basis for determining correlations between two or more co-occurring event types and their associated levels of citizen satisfaction, while further considering environmental factors. Based on Multiple Regression Analysis (MRA), we established the relationships between scenario variables, obtaining a variance of 60%–90% between the dependent and independent variables. The selected combination of supervised NLP techniques leverages an accuracy of 88.5%. We found that all regression models had at least one variable below the 0.05 threshold of the f−test, therefore at least one statistically significant independent variable.

Globally, buildings consume up to 40% of the world’s total energy. By 2030, it is expected to increase to 50%. Therefore, the world is facing a great challenge to overcome these problems related to global energy production. Malaysia is one of the top consumers of primary energy in Asia. In 2018, primary energy consumption for Malaysia was 3.79 quadrillion btu at an average annual rate of 4.58%. In this paper, we have carried out a detailed literature review on several previous studies of energy consumption in the world, especially in Malaysia, and how geographical information system (GIS) methods have been used for the spatial assessment of energy efficiency. Indeed, strategies of energy efficiency are essential in energy policy that could be created using various approaches used for energy savings in buildings. The findings of this review reveal that, for estimating energy consumption, exploring renewable energy sources, and investigating solar radiation, several geographic information system techniques such as multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA), machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) are mainly utilized. The result indicates that the fuzzy DS method can more reliably determine the optimal PV farm locations. The 3D models are also regarded as an effective tool for estimating solar radiation, since this method generates a 3D model exportable to software tools. In addition, GIS and 3D can contribute to several purposes, such as sunlight access to buildings in urban areas, city growth prediction models and analysis of the habitability of public places.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Maria""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: urban","https://doi.org/10.3390/su13169244",NA,NA,NA

Few studies have focused on rainstorm waterlogging at the scale of urban agglomeration areas. We used the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) of China as a case study. Kernel density estimation (KDE) and spatial autocorrelation analysis were applied to study the spatial distribution characteristics of rainstorm waterlogging spots during 2013–2017. A geographical detector (GD) and geographically weighted regression (GWR) were used to discuss the driving mechanism of rainstorm waterlogging by considering eight driving factors: impervious surface ratio (ISR), mean shape index of impervious surface (Shape_MN), aggregation index of impervious surface (AI), fractional vegetation cover (FVC), elevation, slope, river density, and river distance. The risk of rainstorm waterlogging was assessed using GWR based on principal component analysis (PCA). The results show that the spatial distribution of rainstorm waterlogging in the GBA has the characteristics of multicenter clustering. Land cover characteristic factors are the most important factors influencing rainstorm waterlogging in the GBA and most of the cities within the GBA. The rainstorm waterlogging density increases when ISR, Shape_MN, and AI increase, while it decreases when FVC, elevation, slope, and river distance increase. There is no obvious change rule between rainstorm waterlogging and river density. All of the driving factors enhance the impacts on rainstorm waterlogging through their interactions. The relationships between rainstorm waterlogging and the driving factors have obvious spatial differences because of the differences in the dominant factors affecting rainstorm waterlogging in different spatial positions. Furthermore, the result of the risk assessment of rainstorm waterlogging indicates that the southwest area of Guangzhou and the central area of Shenzhen have the highest risks of rainstorm waterlogging in GBA.

Employing the CORINE Land Cover dataset to analyze the dynamic changes in land use/land cover (LULC) in Estonia over 28 years revealed that urban land increased by 33.96% in Harju County and by 19.50% in Tartu County. Therefore, after three decades of LULC changes, the large number of shifts from agricultural and forest land to urban ones in an unplanned manner have become of great concern. To this end, understanding how LULC change contributes to urban expansion will provide helpful information for policy-making in LULC and help make better decisions for future transitions in urban expansion orientation and plan for more sustainable cities. Many different factors govern urban expansion; however, physical and proximity factors play a significant role in explaining the spatial complexity of this phenomenon in Estonia. In this research, it was claimed that urban expansion was affected by the 12 proximity driving forces. In this regard, we applied LR and MLP neural network models to investigate the prediction power of these models and find the influential factors driving urban expansion in two Estonian counties. Using LR determined that the independent variables “distance from main roads (X7)”, “distance from the core of main cities of Tallinn and Tartu land (X2)”, and “distance from water land (X11)” had a higher negative correlation with urban expansion in both counties. Indeed, this investigation requires thinking towards constructing a balance between urban expansion and its driving forces in the long term in the way of sustainability. Using the MLP model determined that the “distance from existing residential areas (X10)” in Harju County and the “distance from the core of Tartu (X2)” in Tartu County were the most influential driving forces. The LR model showed the prediction power of these variables to be 37% for Harju County and 45% for Tartu County. In comparison, the MLP model predicted nearly 80% of variability by independent variables for Harju County and approximately 50% for Tartu County, expressing the greater power of independent variables.

In this study, we conducted field measurements targeting ozone and its key precursors by utilizing a novel proton transfer reaction time-of-flight mass spectrometer (PTR-TOF-MS) in Changzhou, which is representative of the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) city cluster of China. We further applied the integrated methodology including machine learning, an observation-based model (OBM) and sensitivity analysis to obtain insights into the reasons causing the obvious increase in ozone. Major findings include the following: (1) by deweathered calculation, we found changes in precursor emissions contributed 1.46 ppbv to the increase in the observed O3 during the full-lockdown period in 2020, while meteorology constrained 3.0 ppbv of O3 in the full-lockdown period of 2019. (2) By using an OBM, we found that although a significant reduction in O3 precursors was observed during the full-lockdown period, the photochemical formation of O3 was stronger than that during the pre-lockdown period. (3) The NOx/VOC ratio dropped dramatically from 1.84 during the pre-lockdown to 0.79 in the full-lockdown period, which switched O3 formation from a VOC-limited regime to the boundary of a NOx- and VOC-limited regime. Additionally, box model results suggested that the decrease in the NOx/VOC ratio during the full-lockdown period could increase the mean O3 by 2.4 ppbv. Results of this study give insights into the relationship between O3 and its precursors in urban area and demonstrate reasons for the obvious increase in O3 in most urban areas of China during the COVID-19 lockdown period. This study also underlines the necessity of controlling anthropogenic oxygenated volatile organic compounds (OVOCs), alkenes and aromatics in the sustained campaign of reducing O3 pollution in China.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Maria""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: urban","https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-4853-2022",NA,NA,NA

Building science practitioners and researchers have been able to select from a variety of weather files, such as Weather Year for Energy Calculation 2 (WYEC2) and the Typical Meteorological Year (TMY). However, commonly used weather files are typically synthesized to represent trends over a relatively longer periods of time, and are often unable to accurately depict climatic conditions that result from local contexts, such as the heat island effect, wind flow, even local temperature and relative humidity. This results in discrepancies in building performance simulations. This study proposes a methodology using recurrent neural networks to generate synthetic localized weather data that are significantly more accurate and representative of local conditions than standard weather files. The predictions were validated against actual on-site measurements, and achieved a low mean square error of 2.96 and over 185% improvement in validation accuracy. Overall, the performance of selected models has shown over 100% improvements in test accuracy compared with standard weather files and weather station data at the nearest airport. The proposed methodology can be used to morph generic weather files to accurately represent localized conditions, or generate localized data for a longer time span with only a subset of data available/collected. This is useful for downstream built environment applications, especially building energy modeling, since representative weather data capturing trends of temperature and other variables will result in enhanced accuracies of the building energy models.

Different types ofMulti-Objective Optimization Algorithms (MOOAs) based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) have been frequently employed, but their ability and performance have not been evaluated and compared properly.

This study conducted a multidimensional historical analysis of air pollution to investigate the impacts of energy transformation and environmental policy and to determine the long-term environmental implications of certain actions. Additionally, machine learning (ML) techniques were employed for air pollution prediction, taking spatial factors into account. By utilizing multiple low-cost air sensors categorized as IoT devices, this study incorporated data from various locations and assessed the influence of neighboring sensors on predictions. Different ML approaches were analyzed, including regression models, deep neural networks, and ensemble learning. The possibility of implementing such predictions in publicly accessible IT mobile systems was explored. The research was conducted in Krakow, Poland, a UNESCO-listed city that has had long struggle with air pollution. Krakow is also at the forefront of implementing policies to prohibit the use of solid fuels for heating and establishing clean transport zones. The research showed that population growth within the city does not have a negative impact on PMx concentrations, and transitioning from coal-based to sustainable energy sources emerges as the primary factor in improving air quality, especially for PMx, while the impact of transportation remains less relevant. The best results for predicting rare smog events can be achieved using linear ML models. Implementing actions based on this research can significantly contribute to building a smart city that takes into account the impact of air pollution on quality of life.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Maria""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: urban","https://doi.org/10.3390/en17112738",NA,NA,NA

However, urban expansion in towns and cities of the developing world has been characterized by entangled structures and trends exacerbating numerous negative consequences such as pollution, ecological degradation, loss of agricultural land and green areas, and deprived settlements. Substantially, spatial simulation of urban growth and their consequences on coastal areas particularly in Egypt is still very rare. Geospatial modelling coastal urban growth is crucial and has enormous potential for coastal land use transformation and urban sustainability. The key aim of this study was to analyze spatiotemporal changes (2010–2020) and simulate future dynamics (2030 to 2050) of land use/land cover (LULC) in Alexandria Governorate, Egypt. Artificial Neural Network–Multiple Layer Perceptron (ANN-MLP) and Markov Chain techniques were employed within the GIS platform to assess processes of land transitions and predict urban growth trends, patterns and dimensions. The forecasting process was based on three maps of LULC derived from classified Landsat images of 2000, 2010 and 2020. In addition, topographical, demographic, accessibility, proximity factors were generated and developed in the form of raster spatial parameters of urbanization driving forces. The findings revealed that the observed expansion of the built-up area during one decade (2010–2020) was 12,477.51 ha, with a decline in agricultural area (7440.39 ha) and bare land (4904.91 ha). The projected change was forecasted to be 71,544 ha by 2030 and 81,983 ha in 2040 with a total of 35,998 ha increase in the built-up area and residential expansion by 2050. Despite this expected pattern of rapid changes, urban growth will be shaped by the key drivers of proximity to coastline and agricultural land transformation. The analysis indicates that the vertical urban growth will be most likely dominant along the coastal zone due to the lack of vacant lands, whereas the horizontal urban expansion will primarily take place towards the east-northeastern and south-southeastern directions of the city. The present work provides a holistic framework for establishing initial coastal land use plans not only for planners and urban administrators in Alexandria but also for policymakers and coastal municipalities in developing nations.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Maria""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: urban","https://doi.org/10.3390/rs15030601",NA,NA,NA

To forecast future LULC, the Cellular Automaton–Markov Chain (CA) based on artificial neural network (ANN) concepts was used using cartographic variables such as environmental, economic, and cultural. For segmenting LULC, the study used a combination of ML models, such as support vector machine (SVM) and Maximum Likelihood Classifier (MLC). The study is empirical in nature, and it employs quantitative analyses to shed light on LULC variations through time. The result indicates that the barren land is expected to shrink from 55.2 km2 in 1990 to 5.6 km2 in 2050, signifying better land management or increasing human activity. Vegetative expanses, on the other hand, are expected to rise from 81.3 km2 in 1990 to 205.6 km2 in 2050, reflecting a balance between urbanization and ecological conservation. Agricultural fields are expected to increase from 2597.4 km2 in 1990 to 2859.6 km2 in 2020 before stabilizing at 2898.4 km2 in 2050. Water landscapes are expected to shrink from 13.4 km2 in 1990 to 5.6 km2 in 2050, providing possible issues for water resources. Wetland regions are expected to decrease, thus complicating irrigation and groundwater reservoir sustainability. These findings are confirmed by strong statistical indices, with this study’s high kappa coefficients of Kno (0.97), Kstandard (0.95), and Klocation (0.97) indicating a reasonable level of accuracy in CA prediction. From the result of the F1 score, a significant issue was found in MLC for segmenting vegetation, and the issue was resolved in SVM classification.

The use of remote sensing and GIS has helped to generate LULC thematic maps, which have proven immensely valuable in resource and land-use management, facilitating sustainable development by balancing developmental interests and conservation measures. The research utilized socio-economic and spatial variables such as slope, elevation, distance from streams, distance from roads, distance from built-up areas, and distance from the center of town to determine their impact on the LULC of 2016 and 2019. The research integrates Artificial Neural Network with Cellular Automta to forecast and establish potential land use changes for the years 2025 and 2040. Comparison between the predicted and actual LULC maps of 2022 indicates high agreement with kappa hat of 0.77 and a percentage of correctness of 86.83%. The study indicates that the built-up area will increase by 8.37 km 2 by 2040, resulting in a reduction of 7.08 km 2 and 1.16 km 2 in protected and agricultural areas, respectively.

Therefore, predicting the impact of future expansion on regional ecological security can guide regionally coordinated development. In this study, we used land-use data to determine the spatiotemporal evolution of urbanization and land use in the Guangdong–Hong Kong–Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) urban agglomeration from 1990 to 2020 and employed the artificial neural network–cellular automata (ANN–CA)–Markov model to simulate future expansion under three different scenarios for 2025 and 2035. From 1990 to 2020, the overall development level of the GBA urban agglomeration was relatively high, with the area of construction land following a pattern of first increasing rapidly and then gradually transitioning to a slower rate of growth. Land use was consistently dominated by forest land, which accounted for more than 50% of the total land area, followed by arable land (30.56%) and construction land (7.92%). The most intense expansion in the GBA occurred in the main urban areas of Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Foshan, Dongguan, and other cities. The expansion sources were mainly farmland, water, and other ecological land types. The spatial structure and characteristics of simulated future regional land-use changes in 2025 and 2035 differed significantly under the three different scenarios. Under the natural development scenario, urban expansion was unconstrained, and rapid growth occurred over a large area of ecological land. Conversely, the addition of ecological constraints effectively controlled the occupation of forest land and cultivated land. Under the economic development scenario, urban expansion incorporated more unused and cultivated land. The results of this study provide a reference for policy decision-making in regional planning, urban planning, and regional ecological protection under multiple future scenarios.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Maria""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: urban","https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-023-01968-5",NA,NA,NA

Therefore, we first classified earthquake vulnerability evaluation criteria into three categories: exposure, sensitivity, and adaptability capacity attributed to a total of 16 spatial criteria, which were inputted into the neural network. To train the neural network and compute an earthquake vulnerability map, we used a combined Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) process with 167 vulnerable locations as training data, of which 70% (117 points) were used for training, and 30% (50 points) were used for testing and validation. The Mean Average Error (MAE) of the implemented neural network was 0.085, which proves the efficacy of the designed model. The results showed that 29% of Tehran’s total area is extremely vulnerable to earthquakes. Our factor importance analysis showed that factors such as proximity to fault lines, high population density, and environmental factors gained higher importance scores for earthquake vulnerability assessment of the given case study.

The demand for water due to exponential increase in population has created stresses on available groundwater resources. Further, climate change has affected the quantity of water globally. Many parts of Indian cities are experiencing water scarcity. Thus, assessment of groundwater potential is necessary for sustainable utilization and management of water resources. We utilized a novel ensemble approach using artificial neural network multi-layer perceptron (ANN-MLP), random forest (RF), M5 prime (M5P) and support vector machine for regression (SMOReg) models for assessing groundwater potential in the Parbhani district of Maharashtra in India. Ten site-specific influencing factors, elevation, slope, aspect, drainage density, rainfall, water table depth, lineament density, land use land cover, geomorphology, and soil types, were integrated for preparation of groundwater potential zones. The results revealed that the largest area of the district was found under moderate category GWP zone followed by poor, good, very good and very poor. Spatial distribution of GWP zones showed that Poor GWPZs are spread over north, central and southern parts of the district. Very poor GWPZs are mostly found in the north-western and southern parts of the district. The study calls for policy implications to conserve and manage groundwater in these parts. The ensembled model has proved to be effective for assessment of GWP zones.

Gaseous pollutants at the ground level seriously threaten the urban air quality environment and public health. There are few estimates of gaseous pollutants that are spatially and temporally resolved and continuous across China. This study takes advantage of big data and artificial-intelligence technologies to generate seamless daily maps of three major ambient pollutant gases, i.e., NO2, SO2, and CO, across China from 2013 to 2020 at a uniform spatial resolution of 10 km. Cross-validation between our estimates and ground observations illustrated a high data quality on a daily basis for surface NO2, SO2, and CO concentrations, with mean coefficients of determination (root-mean-square errors) of 0.84 (7.99 µg m−3), 0.84 (10.7 µg m−3), and 0.80 (0.29 mg m−3), respectively. We found that the COVID-19 lockdown had sustained impacts on gaseous pollutants, where surface CO recovered to its normal level in China on around the 34th day after the Lunar New Year, while surface SO2 and NO2 rebounded more than 2 times slower due to more CO emissions from residents' increased indoor cooking and atmospheric oxidation capacity. Surface NO2, SO2, and CO reached their peak annual concentrations of 21.3 ± 8.8 µg m−3, 23.1 ± 13.3 µg m−3, and 1.01 ± 0.29 mg m−3 in 2013, then continuously declined over time by 12 %, 55 %, and 17 %, respectively, until 2020. The declining rates were more prominent from 2013 to 2017 due to the sharper reductions in anthropogenic emissions but have slowed down in recent years. Nevertheless, people still suffer from high-frequency risk exposure to surface NO2 in eastern China, while surface SO2 and CO have almost reached the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended short-term air quality guidelines (AQG) level since 2018, benefiting from the implemented stricter “ultra-low” emission standards. This reconstructed dataset of surface gaseous pollutants will benefit future (especially short-term) air pollution and environmental health-related studies.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Maria""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: urban","https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-1511-2023",NA,NA,NA

Most studies focus on sustainable urban-transportation systems for passengers. Freight transportation in cities has increased significantly during the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to greenhouse gases emissions and negative externalities, such as traffic congestion. The purpose of this paper is to identify through a systematic literature review which innovations (hardware and software) applied by logistics service providers (LSPs) in sustainable urban freight (SUF) are suitable to support the transition to energy-efficient smart cities. We propose to classify the existing innovations in last-mile delivery for SUF into categories: (1) urban freight consolidation and/or trans-shipment; (2) the Consumer as a Service Provider (CaaSP); (3) choice of transportation modes. We introduce the concept of CaaSP as an innovative solution in last-mile delivery (LMD), where customers take over some transport operations with the use of smart technologies, and thus reduce the energy demand. We consider the modes of transportation, such as: drones, autonomous delivery robots, autonomous vehicles, cargo bikes (including e-cargo bikes, e-tricycles), electric vehicles (mainly vans), and combined passenger-and-cargo transportation rapid-transit systems. From the analyzed dataset, we find that energy-efficiency in smart cities can be improved by the consolidation of parcels in micro-depots, parcel lockers, and mobile depots. We analyze smart technologies (the Internet of things, big data, artificial intelligence, and digital twins), which enable energy efficiency by reducing the energy demand (fuel) of SUF, due to better operational planning and infrastructure sharing by logistics service providers. We propose a new IEE matrix as an actionable tool for the classification of innovations applied by LSPs in SUF, according to the level of their interconnectivity and energy efficiency. Additionally, this paper contributes to the theory by exploring possible future research directions for SUF in energy-efficient smart cities.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Maria""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: urban","https://doi.org/10.3390/en16062617",NA,NA,NA

Key sources include peer-reviewed articles, case studies, and reports on smart city initiatives, climate change impacts, and the implementation of health technologies in NYC. Key findings reveal that the integration of smart city technologies, such as advanced data analytics, IoT devices, and AI-driven solutions, has significantly improved healthcare delivery and emergency response during winter. However, challenges in implementation, particularly in under-resourced settings, highlight the need for tailored, context-driven technological solutions. The impact of climate change on winter health dynamics underscores the importance of innovative urban planning and public health strategies. The potential of emerging technologies, including nanotechnology for air purification and spatial analysis of health data, offers promising avenues for improving public health in urban settings during winter. The review suggests that technological innovations play a crucial role in enhancing the capacity of NYC to manage winter health risks. It recommends increased investment in smart city technologies, support for under-resourced healthcare settings, and the development of climate change adaptation strategies. The evolution of healthcare in winter contexts is increasingly being shaped by these technological advancements, paving the way for a more resilient and sustainable approach to public health in urban environments.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Maria""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: urban","https://doi.org/10.30574/ijsra.2024.11.1.0078",NA,NA,NA

UAVs can be used for a wide range of applications, including emergency response, civil protection, search and rescue, and surveillance, thanks to their high mobility and reasonable price. Automatic recognition of human activity in aerial videos captured by drones is critical for various tasks for these applications. However, this is difficult due to many factors specific to aerial views, including camera motion, vibration, low resolution, background clutter, lighting conditions, and variations in view. Although deep learning approaches have demonstrated their effectiveness in a variety of challenging vision tasks, they require either a large number of labelled aerial videos for training or a dataset with balanced classes, both of which can be difficult to obtain. To address these challenges, a hybrid data augmentation method is proposed which combines data transformation with the Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based feature augmentation method. In particular, we apply the basic transformation methods to increase the amount of video in the database. A Convolutional Neural Network–Long Short-Term Memory (CNN-LSTM) model is used to learn the spatio-temporal dynamics of actions, then a GAN-based technique is applied to generate synthetic CNN-LSTM features conditioned on action classes which provide a high discriminative spatio-temporal features. We tested our model on the YouTube aerial database, demonstrating encouraging results that surpass those of previous state-of-the-art works, including an accuracy rate of 97.83%.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Maria""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: urban","https://doi.org/10.3390/rs15143626",NA,NA,NA

The high‐resolution quantification of building stock is essential to understand the spatial concentration of materials, urban mining potential, and sustainable urban development. Current approaches rely excessively on statistics or survey data, both of which are unavailable for most cities, particularly in underdeveloped areas. This study proposes an end‐to‐end deep‐learning model based on multi‐source remote sensing data, enabling the reliable estimation of building stock. Ground‐detail features extracted from optical remote sensing (ORS) and spatiotemporal features extracted from nighttime light (NTL) data are fused and incorporated into the model to improve accuracy. We also compare the performance of our feature‐fusion model with that of an ORS‐only regression model and traditional NTL regression for Beijing. The proposed model yields the best building‐stock estimation, with a Spearman's rank correlation coefficient of 0.69, weighted root mean square error of 0.58, and total error in the test set below 14%. Using gradient‐weighted class activation mapping, we further investigate the relationship between ORS features and building‐stock estimation. Our model exhibits reliable predictive capability and illustrates the tremendous value of the physical environment for estimating building stock. This research illustrates the significant potential of ORS and deep learning for stock estimation. Large‐scale, long‐term building‐stock investigations could also benefit from the end‐to‐end predictability and the data availability of the model.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Maria""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: urban","https://doi.org/10.1111/jiec.13356",NA,NA,NA

The CA-Markov model has been proven to be an effective method for land use modeling because of its simplicity and potential for evolution. However, it is difficult to apply this method to meet the requirement of land use planning and management since it fails to consider the driving forces of LUCC. To evaluate the factors that influence LUCC comprehensively, we developed and implemented a machine learning-based CA-Markov model to understand the dynamics of LUCC in a coastal watershed in Southeast China, the Minjiang River Watershed (MRW). The proposed method performed well for each land use category, with average AUC values of 0.999 and 0.916 for the training and testing periods, respectively, for suitable images. The overall accuracy for LUCC was 0.971. The urbanization process in the MRW was speeding up recently. Urban area increased by 2.22% of the total area during 2015–2020, and most of that was from conversion of woodland and agricultural land. Additionally, the proposed method provided a much deeper understating of the forces driving the LUCC on a regional scale. Population and gross domestic product (GDP) were the major factors influencing the distribution of urbanized land in the MRW. In contrast, woodland distribution was highly related to topographic factors in the MRW. Scenario analysis was also employed to identify patterns of LUCC under different scenarios. The results showed that the process of urbanization may become more complex with increasing population and GDP and that land use evolution may be more sustainable with scientific spatial plans which consider facilities for people and ecological protection. The proposed method quantifies the LUCC in changing environmental settings and can serve as a helpful tool for sustainable watershed management.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Maria""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: urban","https://doi.org/10.3390/rs15082128",NA,NA,NA

Smart Mobility is believed to be a solution to some of these challenges by providing comprehensive and intelligent mobility services, decreasing transportation costs, promoting safety, and combating pollution and traffic congestion. Despite this potential, there is still uncertainty surrounding what smart mobility is and whether it is moving toward improving the quality of life and making cities more sustainable. To address this gap, this paper conducts a bibliometric review of 3223 Web of Science Core Collection-indexed documents to provide a comprehensive understanding of smart mobility research. The findings reveal a lack of multi-disciplinary approaches in previous studies with a strong emphasis on technological aspects and limited social or economic considerations in current research. The review identifies four distinct periods of smart mobility research, with recent interest sparked by advancements in big data, deep learning, artificial intelligence, and real-time technologies in transport systems. However, there is a dearth of research on smart mobility in developing countries, where urban populations are rapidly increasing. Thus, the review proposes a research agenda to address the current gaps in knowledge. Furthermore, the review provides an updated and integrated definition of smart mobility as the use of advanced technologies, such as the Internet of Things (IoT), big data analytics, and artificial intelligence, to improve transportation efficiency, mobility for all, and sustainability while safeguarding the quality of life. The primary challenge for smart mobility is the co-evolution with existing transport systems, making further research on integration with these systems and real-time technologies essential for advancing smart mobility research. The paper’s main contribution is an integrated conceptualisation of smart mobility research and novel research topics that build on this unified base.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Maria""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: urban","https://doi.org/10.3390/su15086754",NA,NA,NA

The rapid flood inundation has caused extremely severe damage to urban residents and social infrastructures. In addition, urban Southeast Asia usually has inadequate capacities in drainage systems, complicated land use patterns, and a large vulnerable population in limited urban areas. To reduce the urban flood risk and enhance the resilience of vulnerable urban communities, it has been of essential importance to develop real-time urban flood forecasting systems for flood disaster prevention authorities and the urban public. This paper reviewed the state-of-the-art models of real-time forecasting systems for urban flash floods. The real-time system basically consists of the following subsystems, i.e., rainfall forecasting, drainage system modelling, and inundation area mapping. This paper summarized the recent radar data utilization methods for rainfall forecasting, physical-process-based hydraulic models for flood inundation prediction, and data-driven artificial intelligence (AI) models for the real-time forecasting system. This paper also dealt with available technologies for modelling, e.g., digital surface models (DSMs) for the finer urban terrain of drainage systems. The review indicated that an obstacle to using process-based hydraulic models was the limited computational resources and shorter lead time for real-time forecasting in many urban areas in tropical Southeast Asia.

Traditionally, governments heavily depend on field survey methods to monitor the urban villages, which however are time-consuming, labor-intensive, and possibly delayed. Thanks to widely available and timely updated satellite images, recent studies develop computer vision techniques to detect urban villages efficiently. However, existing studies either focus on simple urban village image classification or fail to provide accurate boundary information. To accurately identify urban village boundaries from satellite images, we harness the power of the vision foundation model and adapt the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to urban village segmentation, named UV-SAM. Specifically, UV-SAM first leverages a small-sized semantic segmentation model to produce mixed prompts for urban villages, including mask, bounding box, and image representations, which are then fed into SAM for fine-grained boundary identification. Extensive experimental results on two datasets in China demonstrate that UV-SAM outperforms existing baselines, and identification results over multiple years show that both the number and area of urban villages are decreasing over time, providing deeper insights into the development trends of urban villages and sheds light on the vision foundation models for sustainable cities.

With the development of high-resolution satellite, the two-dimensional image has been able to identify more ground object information on a fine scale, but it lacks the application of three-dimensional characteristics and social attributes. At the same time, machine learning and deep learning have shown great utility in extracting features, and they should be applied more to the classification of urban functional areas to improve efficiency. To solve these problems, we propose an efficient and accurate framework for mapping UFA using multi-source geospatial data.

An improved frequency density (IFD) model was proposed to improve the overall classification accuracy by 4.4%. Besides, the nighttime light (NTL) data from SDGSAT-1 satellite glimmer imagers are also used to classify UFA.

As a result of recent global episodes of urban air pollution, policymakers and administration agencies are endeavoring to regulate urban land use and land cover change (LULC) and sustainably enhance air quality. This study aims to establish a relationship between alterations in PM2.5 concentration and LULC features. The Bangladesh Meteorological Department provided PM2.5 and meteorological data for 2012 and 2018, and RapidEye image data was used to classify land-use for 2012 and 2018. Between 2012 and 2018, waterbodies and vegetation fell by 2% and 5.3%, and construction and bare land increased by 4% and 3.4%, respectively. Reduced vegetation and waterbodies might result in an increase in barren land and built-up areas. Numerous industrial sites and the unlawful acquisition of canals may also contribute to the growth of barren land. In 2018, homogeneity of the landscape pattern is higher than 2011. The aggregation and contagion indices, landscape metrices, have inverse correlation of −0.01 and −0.158 respectively with PM2.5 concentrations. However, the landscape index has positive correlation of 0.06 with PM2.5 concentrations. On the other hand, the variability in PM2.5 concentrations is correlated with the altered characteristics of LULCs and related landscape indicators. According to the spatial correlation, PM2.5 levels have decreased as vegetation and waterbodies have increased, as the PM2.5 concentration is negatively correlated with vegetation and waterbodies by −0.212 and −0.028, respectively. Furthermore, meteorological indices are significantly correlated with PM2.5 concentration, which was used as an independent variable to estimate the annual average PM2.5 concentration levels for 2024 using an Artificial Neural Network, which range from 312 to 188 μg/m3.

The review covers the UFRA process considering urban elements, methods, tools and techniques, and challenges in achieving resilience and provides guidance for constructing advance resilience assessment frameworks. Scopus and Web of Science databases were accessed by employing pertinent keywords. The review of UFRA literature reveals a prevalence of frameworks analysing isolated or clustered urban elements rather than a comprehensive framework for assessing flood resilience.

Machine learning (multivariate random forest) and univariate non-linear regression are applied, identifying best-fit converging models for a broad range of explanatory socioeconomic variables. These proxies describe in a variety of ways generic levels of progress, such as Gross Domestic Product - Purchasing Power per capita, Social Progress Index (SPI) and Corruption Perceptions Index. Specifically, the research tests and quantitatively confirms a long-standing, yet unverified, hypothesis: that variability in cities' performance on MSW can be accounted for by socioeconomic development indices. The results provide a baseline for measuring progress as cities report MSW performance for the sustainable development goal SDG11.6.1 indicator: median rates of controlled recovery and disposal are approximately at 45 % for cities in low-income countries, 75 % in lower-middle, and 100 % for both upper-middle and high-income. Casting light on aspects beyond the SDG metric, on the quality of MSW-related services, show that improvements in service quality often lag improvements in service coverage. Overall, the findings suggest that progress in collection coverage, and controlled recovery and disposal has already taken place in low- and middle-income cities. However, if cities aspire to perform better on MSW management than would have been anticipated by the average socioeconomic development in their country, they should identify ways to overcome systemic underlying failures associated with that socioeconomic level.

More attention needs to be paid to sustainable modes such as public transit and walking. The built environment is expected to have an impact on commuting mode choice. Built environments with higher density, diversity, intentional design, destination accessibility, and shorter distance to transit (collectively known as the 5 Ds of the built environment) are hypothesized to lead to more sustainable mode choices, including public transit and walking. In this paper, we evaluate the impact of built environment variables on commuting modal split, including the four modes of public transit-bus, public transit-rail, walking, and driving. The study is conducted in Mecklenburg County, North Carolina, at the geographic level of census block groups in year 2015. Given the complexity of relationships in the built environment-travel behavior subject, the random forest method is used to predict aggregated commuting mode choice. Random forest is employed as it is capable of capturing nonlinear relationships and is not constrained by limitations in other widely used methods, such as multinomial logistic regression. After predicting the commuting mode shares, SHAP values (SHapley Additive exPlanations) are used to evaluate the impact of the built environment on commuting mode choices. As an advanced machine learning method, SHAP values adds explainability to the model. This method resolves the known limitation of machine learning methods as being ""black boxes"" and converts them to ""white boxes"" by providing interpretability.

Thanks to its rigorous ML-based design, our study helps to solidify the state of knowledge with strong evidence that block groups with higher degrees of the 5Ds lead to more choices of public transit and walking modes.

Massive multi-source and multi-scale data include mobile phone signaling data (500 m × 500 m), aerial images (0.49 m × 0.49 m), night light satellite data (500 m × 500 m), land use data (street-block), and POIs data. Methods of convolutional neural network, guided gradient-weighted class activation mapping, bivariate local indicator of spatial association, Elbow and K-means are jointly applied. It is found that the recovery in central areas was slower than in suburbs, especially in terms of working and night-life activities, showing a donut-shaped spatial pattern. Residential areas with mixed land uses seem more resilient to the pandemic shock. More than 60% of open spaces are highly associated with recovery in areas with high-level pre-pandemic social-economic activities. POIs of sports and recreation are crucial to the recovery in all areas, while POIs of transportation and science/culture are also important to the recovery in many areas. Policy implications are discussed from perspectives of open spaces, public facilities, neighborhood units, spatial structures, and anchoring roles of POIs.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Maria""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: urban","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-29189-5",NA,NA,NA

Especially, recent studies turn to self-supervised contrastive learning with manually designed similarity metrics for urban imagery representation learning and further socioeconomic prediction, which however suffers from effectiveness and robustness issues. To address such issues, in this paper, we propose a Knowledge-infused Contrastive Learning (KnowCL) model for urban imagery-based socioeconomic prediction. Specifically, we firstly introduce knowledge graph (KG) to effectively model the urban knowledge in spatiality, mobility, etc., and then build neural network based encoders to learn representations of an urban image in associated semantic and visual spaces, respectively. Finally, we design a cross-modality based contrastive learning framework with a novel image-KG contrastive loss, which maximizes the mutual information between semantic and visual representations for knowledge infusion. Extensive experiments of applying the learnt visual representations for socioeconomic prediction on three datasets demonstrate the superior performance of KnowCL with over 30% improvements on R2 compared with baselines. Especially, our proposed KnowCL model can apply to both satellite and street imagery with both effectiveness and transferability achieved, which provides insights into urban imagery-based socioeconomic prediction.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Maria""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: urban","https://doi.org/10.1145/3543507.3583876",NA,NA,NA

Satellite derived UGS maps provide an efficient and effective tool for urban studies and contribute to targets and indicators of the sustainable development goals, at the global level, set by the United Nations. However, clouds create a challenging issue in optical satellite image processing, leading to significant uncertainty in UGS mapping. In this study, we propose an automatic UGS mapping method by integrating satellite images with crowdsourced geospatial data while aiming to reduce the uncertainty caused by cloud contamination. The proposed method consists of three parts: (1) auxiliary data pre-processing module; (2) cloud attention intelligent network (CAI-net); and (3) non-cloud scenes classification module. The auxiliary data pre-processing module was used to convert crowdsourcing geospatial data into auxiliary maps. The CAI-net was proposed to retrieve detailed UGS classes within clouds from satellite image patches and auxiliary maps, while non-cloud scenes classification module was used to extract UGS from satellite image patches. The proposed method was applied to generate spatial continuous global UGS map products, considering the uncertainty caused by cloud contamination. The results show the proposed method yielded a high-quality global UGS map with average overall accuracy as high as 92.96% when satellite images had cloud coverage ranging from 0% to 50%. The geospatial AI, specifically CAI-net, can provide more accurate UGS mapping regardless of different geographical and climatic conditions of the study areas, which is especially significant for humid tropical and subtropical regions with frequent clouds and rains.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Maria""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: urban","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2023.03.005",NA,NA,NA

The proliferation of bike-sharing systems, characterised by their wide availability and high usage rates, has made cycling in urban areas more accessible and convenient for individuals. While the existence of a relationship between cycling behaviour and the built environment has been established, few studies have specifically examined this connection for weekdays and weekends. With the emergence of new data sources, new methodologies have become available for research into this area. For instance, bike-sharing spatio-temporal datasets have made it possible to precisely measure cycling behaviour over time, while street-view images and deep learning techniques now enable researchers to quantify the built environment from a human perspective. In this study, we used 139,018 cycling trips and 14,947 street-view images to examine the connection between the built environment consisting of urban greenways and cycling behaviour. The results indicated that the greenness and enclosure of the level of greenway were positively correlated with increased cycling on both weekdays and weekends. However, the openness of the greenway appears to have opposing effects on cycling behaviour depending on the day of the week, with high levels of openness potentially promoting cycling on weekends but hindering it on weekdays. Based on the findings of this study, policymakers and planners should focus on the cycling environment and prioritise improving its comfort and safety to promote green transportation and bicycle-friendly cities.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Maria""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: urban","https://doi.org/10.3390/land12030619",NA,NA,NA

To close the research gap that previous studies have disregarded the dynamic environmental factors and trajectory data, we propose a framework that comprises four sub-indices: safety, comfort, accessibility, and vitality. Utilizing open-source data, advanced deep neural networks, and GIS spatial analysis, the framework eliminates subjective evaluations and is more efficient and comprehensive than prior methods. The experimental results on Xiamen, China, demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework in identifying areas for improvement and enhancing cycling mobility. The proposed framework provides a structured approach for evaluating bikeability in different geographical contexts, making reproducing bikeability indices easier and more comprehensive to policymakers, transportation planners, and environmental decision-makers.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Maria""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: urban","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jag.2023.103539",NA,NA,NA

UIS extraction has been evolving rapidly in the past decades. However, high-resolution impervious surface mapping is a long-term need. There is an urgent requirement for impervious surface mapping from high-resolution remote sensing imagery. In this paper, we compare current extraction methods in terms of extraction units and extraction models and summarize their strengths and limitations. We discuss the challenges in impervious surface estimation from high spatial resolution remote sensing imagery in terms of selection of spatial resolution, spectral band, and extraction method. The uncertainties caused by clouds and snow, shadows, and vegetation occlusion are also analyzed. Automated sample labeling and remote sensing domain knowledge are the main directions in impervious surface extraction using deep learning methods. We should also focus on using continuous time series of high-resolution imagery and multi-source satellite imagery for dynamic monitoring of impervious surfaces.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Maria""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: urban","https://doi.org/10.3390/rs15102562",NA,NA,NA

This study explores the spatial effects of built environment on quality of life related to transportation (QoLT) through the combination of GIS application and deep learning based on a questionnaire survey by focusing on a case study in Sukhumvit district, Bangkok, Thailand. The Geographic Information System (GIS) was applied for spatial analysis and visualization among all variables through a grid cell (500 × 500 sq.m.). In regard to deep learning, the semantic segmentation process that the model used in this research was OCRNet, and the selected backbone was HRNet_W48. A quality-of-life-related transportation indicator (life satisfaction) was implemented through 500 face-to-face interviews and the data were collected by a questionnaire survey. Then, multinomial regression analysis was performed to demonstrate the significant in positive and negative aspects of independent variables (built environment) with QoLT variables at a 0.05 level of statistical significance. The results revealed the individuals’ satisfaction from a diverse group of people in distinct areas or environments who consequently perceived QoLT differently. Built environmental factors were gathered by application of GIS and deep learning, which provided a number of data sets to describe the clusters of physical scene characteristics related to QoLT. The perception of commuters could be translated to different clusters of the physical attributes through the indicated satisfaction level of QoLT. The findings are consistent with the physical characteristics of each typological site context, allowing for an understanding of differences in accessibility to transport systems, including safety and cost of transport. In conclusion, these findings highlight essential aspects of urban planning and transport systems that must consider discrepancies of physical characteristics in terms of social and economic needs from a holistic viewpoint. A better understanding of QoLT adds important value for transportation development to balance the social, economic, and environmental levels toward sustainable futures.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Maria""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: urban","https://doi.org/10.3390/su15032785",NA,NA,NA

Food security has become a major challenge for the future owing to the scarcity of land, rising global population, urbanization, and polluted soil and water resources. In this scenario, vertical farming as an innovative food production technology caters increased productivity with limited resources and improved carbon footprint. The review begins with a brief introduction to the concept of vertical farming, its opportunities and implications on the economy, environment, and society as a whole, following with an in-depth qualitative analysis of the cutting-edge innovations/technologies are presented in detail. Contrary to the numerous research focusing on mere analysis of economic viability and statistical analysis, the aim is to introduce real cutting-edge technologies that address the challenges of vertical farms such as lack of technical skills or energy requirements. The recent advances of vertical farms includes construction of outer vertical structure and growing shelves using light weight and transparent polymer composites, engineered and tunable LEDs lightings, 3-D printed and recyclable growing substrates, AI-integrated IoTs for environment control, harvesting materials for renewable energy storage etc. Such material innovations with inclusion of AI and robotics transform automated vertical farming into 'state of the art' agricultural technology. Production shelf fabricated using UV cured GBOV-glass fiber composite with 60% transparency can overcome the material weight limitation, corrosion, light obstructions etc. associated with the conventional steel shelves. Replacing non-renewable fossil fuels using renewable energy harvested using carbon dots, florescent materials, and perovskite solar cells is recommended to minimize the high capital investments associated with energy as well as to reduce the environmental impact. Smart materials such as phase change materials and thermoresponsive windows control the amount of energy expended whereas smart substrate promotes resource management. Application of the newest technology AI in vertical farming facilitates precise control of environment, early pest detection, automation of farming processes, data-driven decision making and precision agriculture. In short, vertical farms utilizing modern innovations of science and technology caters enhanced productivity, improved quality, reduced cost, resource management and sustainability. Hence, automated and sustainable vertical farms promoting global food security and circularity have the potential to transform into burgeoning technology of future.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Maria""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: urban","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scs.2024.105357",NA,NA,NA
