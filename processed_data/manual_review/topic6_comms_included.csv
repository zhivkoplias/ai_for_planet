This study employs machine learning and artificial intelligence to automatically detect, identify, and categorize tweets relevant to first responders during Hurricane Harvey. We curate a dataset of tweets, present a labeling scheme based on relevance and urgency, and develop neural and non-neural machine learning models to automatically categorize tweets. Our best relevance classifiers, language models BERT and XLNet, perform significantly better than non-neural models and the deep convolutional neural network (CNN) and achieve comparable F1 scores. Ultimately, this study furthers machine learning and crisis communication research by developing methods to automatically categorize tweets that can signal to first responders of individuals' requests for help in urgent, life-threatening disasters. Our work also finds large pretrained language models promising for the development of well-performing disaster tweet classifiers in future work.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Erik""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: comms","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jjimei.2023.100164",NA,NA,NA

It has become the poster child of generative AI, which is widely diagnosed to disrupt many realms of life — including science communication. This essay reflects on this development. It discusses opportunities for the practice of science communication, such as generative AI’s translational and multimodal capacities and its capacity to provide dialogical science communication at scale, but also challenges in terms of accuracy, ‘wrongness at scale’ or job market implications. It also ponders implications for research on science communication, which has largely neglected (generative) AI so far. It argues that scholars should analyze public communication “about” AI as well as communication “with” AI, given its ‘increased agency’. Furthermore, scholars should analyze the impact of AI on science communication itself and the larger science communication ecosystem.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Erik""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: comms","https://doi.org/10.22323/2.22020402",NA,NA,NA

Substantial research on social media data use during disasters has been conducted in the past decade since various social media platforms have emerged and gained popularity. This research highlights a thorough examination of the textual content of users' posts shared on Twitter across the 48 contiguous U.S. states (CONUS) during hurricanes Harvey (2017) and Dorian (2019). We processed and analyzed 35 million tweets by classifying them into the main topics of concern discussed on Twitter over the CONUS. Sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and topic classification are a few of the Artificial Intelligence techniques from Natural Language Processing (NLP) that we employed in this work to analyze the Twitter data. Applying the NLP techniques on this large volume of data, made it possible to classify the tweet content into distinct categories in order to reveal valuable information on social response to hurricanes and assist crisis management agencies and disaster responders during and post disasters. Furthermore, this study offers helpful insights on the way climate change is discussed on Twitter before, during and after hurricane Harvey and Dorian. The outcome of this study uncovers detailed information on social response to hurricanes which benefits disaster managers and responders in reducing the detrimental effects of such extreme events and enhancing community readiness when these events occur.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Erik""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: comms","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.crm.2023.100480",NA,NA,NA

Recent research has shown that many of these location descriptions go beyond simple place names, such as city names and street names, and are difficult to extract using typical named entity recognition (NER) tools. While advanced machine learning models could be trained, they require large labeled training datasets that can be time-consuming and labor-intensive to create. In this work, we propose a method that fuses geo-knowledge of location descriptions and a Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) model, such as ChatGPT and GPT-4. The result is a geo-knowledge-guided GPT model that can accurately extract location descriptions from disaster-related social media messages. Also, only 22 training examples encoding geo-knowledge are used in our method. We conduct experiments to compare this method with nine alternative approaches on a dataset of tweets from Hurricane Harvey. Our method demonstrates an over 40% improvement over typically used NER approaches. The experiment results also show that geo-knowledge is indispensable for guiding the behavior of GPT models. The extracted location descriptions can help disaster responders reach victims more quickly and may even save lives.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Erik""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: comms","https://doi.org/10.1080/13658816.2023.2266495",NA,NA,NA

In addition, the increase of natural disasters and their aftermath have been increasing causing damages to infrastructure, the economy, livelihood, and lives in general. This study aimed to determine factors affecting the intention to donate for victims of Typhoon Odette, a recent super typhoon that hit the Philippines leading to affect 38 out of 81 provinces of the most natural disaster-prone countries. Determining the most significant factor affecting the intention to donate may help in increasing the engagement of donations among other people to help establish a more stable economy to heighten world development. With the use of deep learning neural network, a 97.12% accuracy was obtained for the classification model. It could be deduced that when donors understand and perceive both severity and vulnerability to be massive and highly damaging, then a more positive intention to donate to victims of typhoons will be observed. In addition, the influence of other people, the holiday season when the typhoon happened, and the media as a platform have greatly contributed to heightening the intention to donate and control over the donor's behavior. The findings of this study could be applied and utilized by government agencies and donation platforms to help engage and promote communication among donors. Moreover, the framework and methodology considered in this study may be extended to evaluate intention, natural disasters, and behavioral studies worldwide.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Erik""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: comms","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envdev.2023.100823",NA,NA,NA

We choose TF-IDF and K-means for sentiment classification among affinitive and hierarchical clustering. Latent Dirichlet Allocation, a pipeline of Doc2Vec and K-means used to capture themes, then perform multi-level polarity indices classification and its time series analysis. In our study, we draw insights from 243,746 tweets for Kerala’s 2018 natural disasters in India. The key findings of the study are the classification of sentiments based on similarity and polarity indices and identifying themes among the topics discussed on Twitter. We observe different sets of emotions and influencers, among others. Through this case example of Kerala floods, it shows how the government and other organizations could track the positive/negative sentiments concerning time and location; gain a better understanding of the topic of discussion trending among the public, and collaborate with crucial Twitter users/influencers to spread and figure out the gaps in the implementation of schemes in terms of design and execution.

In contraposition, the scientific papers evaluating different facets of natural disasters have preferentially used social networks as a source of information. Herein we have shown how the emotions and sentiments expressed in press media can be efficiently analyzed via AI techniques to better assess the social impact of a disaster at the time it takes place. We have also gauged the usefulness of different classifiers combining sentiment analysis with multivariate statistical analysis and machine learning techniques. By applying this methodology, we were able to classify a newspaper article within a certain time frame of the eruption, and we observed significant differences between local news published in Spanish and those of foreign newspapers written in English. We also found different emotional trajectories of articles by applying the Fourier transform onto the inner ""valence"" progress along each article narrative time. In addition, there appeared a significant relationship between the surface area occupied by lava and the emotions and sentiments expressed in the articles—many other correlations and causalities could be explored too.

Story maps are interactive online digital narratives that can describe a territory beyond its map by enriching the map with text, pictures, videos, and other multimedia information. This paper presents a semi-automatic workflow to produce story maps from textual documents containing territory data. An expert first assembles one territory-contextual document containing text and images. Then, automatic processes use natural language processing and Wikidata services to (i) extract key concepts (entities) and geospatial coordinates associated with the territory, (ii) assemble a logically-ordered sequence of enriched story-map events, and (iii) openly publish online story maps and an interoperable Linked Open Data semantic knowledge base for event exploration and inter-story correlation analyses. Our workflow uses an Open Science-oriented methodology to publish all processes and data. Through our workflow, we produced story maps for the value chains and territories of 23 rural European areas of 16 countries. Through numerical evaluation, we demonstrated that territory experts considered the story maps effective in describing their territories, and appropriate for communicating with citizens and stakeholders.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Erik""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: comms","https://doi.org/10.1080/17538947.2023.2168774",NA,NA,NA

Previous work has had success in applying machine-learning classifiers to detect tweets in coarse-grained categories, such as disaster type and relevance. However, there is a dearth of work that focuses on detecting tweets containing requests for help that are actionable by first responders. Using over 5 million tweets posted during 2017's Hurricane Harvey in Houston, U.S., we show that though such requests are uncommon, their often life-or-death nature justifies the development of tweet classifiers to detect them. We find that the best-performing classifiers are a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on word embeddings, support vector machine (SVM) trained on average word embeddings, and multilayer perceptron (MLP) trained on a combination of unigrams and part-of-speech (POS) tags. These models achieve F1 scores of over 0.86, confirming their efficacy in detecting urgent tweets. We highlight the utility of average word embeddings for training non-neural models, and that such features produce results competitive with more traditional n-gram and POS features.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Erik""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: comms","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijdrr.2020.101757",NA,NA,NA

Thus far, the explicit variation of cultural ecosystem services (CESs) and particularly the sentiments of CES-related ecotourism are not well understood. This paper takes advantage of big social media data to unravel the patterns of CESs and visiting sentiments in coastal areas of Hong Kong. Through machine-learned keyword labels, we employed content analysis to derive visual information for geotagged photographs. Applying natural language processing to apps with machine learning in cloud computing, we derived the sentiments based on user-generated textual content associated with coastal ecotourism. Based on regression analysis and multiple comparisons analysis, we identify the association between critical demographic and temporal factors with CES and related visiting sentiments. Referring to previous studies, we identified the main intangible benefits into six basic divisions based on 424 keyword labels for coastal areas. Our results show that hotspots of CESs are spatially concentrated in both cultural attractions and protected areas, which are critical for coastal ecosystem management and protection. More specifically, these areas of high CES value have good spatiotemporal accessibility, high infrastructure coverage, and spatially explicit population and economic growth. Furthermore, we discover that sentiments related to coastal CESs vary based on social media characteristics.

Consequently, it is not surprising that ones related to the COVID-19 pandemic are proliferating given the lack of scientific consensus on the virus's spread and containment, or on the long-term social and economic ramifications of the pandemic. Among the stories currently circulating in US-focused social media forums are ones suggesting that the 5G telecommunication network activates the virus, that the pandemic is a hoax perpetrated by a global cabal, that the virus is a bio-weapon released deliberately by the Chinese, or that Bill Gates is using it as cover to launch a broad vaccination program to facilitate a global surveillance regime. While some may be quick to dismiss these stories as having little impact on real-world behavior, recent events including the destruction of cell phone towers, racially fueled attacks against Asian Americans, demonstrations espousing resistance to public health orders, and wide-scale defiance of scientifically sound public mandates such as those to wear masks and practice social distancing, countermand such conclusions. Inspired by narrative theory, we crawl social media sites and news reports and, through the application of automated machine-learning methods, discover the underlying narrative frameworks supporting the generation of rumors and conspiracy theories. We show how the various narrative frameworks fueling these stories rely on the alignment of otherwise disparate domains of knowledge, and consider how they attach to the broader reporting on the pandemic. These alignments and attachments, which can be monitored in near real time, may be useful for identifying areas in the news that are particularly vulnerable to reinterpretation by conspiracy theorists. Understanding the dynamics of storytelling on social media and the narrative frameworks that provide the generative basis for these stories may also be helpful for devising methods to disrupt their spread.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Erik""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: comms","https://doi.org/10.1007/s42001-020-00086-5",NA,NA,NA

We focus on different natural disasters based on properties such as types, durations, and damages, which contains a total of 41,993 tweets. In this paper, public perception is assessed qualitatively by manually classified tweets, which contain information like the demand for targeted relief supplies, satisfactions of disaster response, and public fear. Public attitudes to natural disasters are studied via a quantitative analysis using eight machine learning models. To better provide decision-makers with the appropriate model, the comparison of machine learning models based on computational time and prediction accuracy is conducted. The change of public opinion during different natural disasters and the evolution of peoples' behavior of using social media for disaster relief in the face of the identical type of natural disasters as Twitter continues to evolve are studied.

We introduce a computer vision system that estimates water depth from social media images taken during flooding events, in order to build flood maps in (near) real-time. We propose a multi-task (deep) learning approach, where a model is trained using both a regression and a pairwise ranking loss. Our approach is motivated by the observation that a main bottleneck for image-based flood level estimation is training data: it is difficult and requires a lot of effort to annotate uncontrolled images with the correct water depth. We demonstrate how to efficiently learn a predictor from a small set of annotated water levels and a larger set of weaker annotations that only indicate in which of two images the water level is higher, and are much easier to obtain. Moreover, we provide a new dataset, named DeepFlood, with 8145 annotated ground-level images, and show that the proposed multi-task approach can predict the water level from a single, crowd-sourced image with ≈11 cm root mean square error.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Erik""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: comms","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2020.07.003",NA,NA,NA

Social media has become an important communication channel for people to share and seek situational information to learn of risks, to cope with community disruptions, and to support disaster response. Recent studies in disaster informatics have recognized the presence of bias in the representation of social media activity in areas affected by disasters. To explore related factors for such bias, existing studies have used geo-tagged tweets to assess the extent of social media activity in disaster-affected areas to evaluate whether vulnerable populations remain silent on social media. However, less than 1% of all tweets are actually geo-tagged; therefore, attempts to understand the representativeness of geotagged tweets to the general population have shown that certain populations are over- or underrepresented. To address this limitation, this study examined the attention given to locations based on social media content. The study conducted a content-based analysis to filter tweets related to 84 super-neighborhoods in Houston during Hurricane Harvey and 57 cities in North Carolina during Hurricane Florence. By examining the relationships among sociodemographic factors, the number of damage claims, and the volume of tweets, the results showed that social media attention concentrates in populous areas, independent of education, language, unemployment, and median income. The relationship between population and social media attention is characterized by a sub-linear power law, indicating a large variation among the sparsely populated areas. Using a machine-learning model to label the topics of the tweets, the results showed that social media users pay more attention to rescue- and donation-related information; nevertheless, the topic variation is consistent across areas with different levels of attention. These findings contribute to a better understanding of the spatial concentration of social media attention regarding posting and spreading situational information in disasters. The findings could inform emergency managers and public officials to effectively use social media data for equitable resource allocation and action prioritization.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Erik""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: comms","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compenvurbsys.2020.101514",NA,NA,NA
