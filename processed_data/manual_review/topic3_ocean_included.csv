They are an important nature-based solution for both climate change mitigation and adaptation. Quantifying blue carbon stocks and assessing their dynamics at large scales through remote sensing remains challenging due to difficulties of cloud coverage, spectral, spatial and temporal limitations of multispectral sensors and speckle noise of synthetic aperture radar (SAR). Recent advances in airborne and space-borne multispectral and SAR imagery and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data, sensor platforms such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), combined with novel machine learning techniques have offered different users with a wide-range of spectral, spatial, and multi-temporal information for quantifying blue carbon from space. However, a large number of challenges are posed by various traits such as atmospheric correction, water penetration, and water column transparency issues in coastal environments, the multi-dimensionality and size of the multispectral and LiDAR data, the limitation of training samples, and backscattering mechanisms of SAR imagery in the acquisition process. As a result, existing methodologies face major difficulties in accurately estimating blue carbon stocks using these datasets. In this context, emerging and innovative machine learning and artificial intelligence methodologies are often required for robustness and reliability of blue carbon estimates, particularly those using open-source software for signal processing and regression tasks. This review provides an overview of Earth Observation data, machine learning and state-of-the-art deep learning techniques that are currently being used to quantify above-ground carbon, below-ground carbon, and soil carbon stocks of mangroves, seagrasses and saltmarshes ecosystems. Some key limitations and future directions for the potential use of data fusion combined with advanced machine learning, deep learning, and metaheuristic optimisation techniques for quantifying blue carbon stocks are also highlighted. In summary, the quantification of blue carbon using remote sensing and machine learning approaches holds great potential in contributing to global efforts towards mitigating climate change and protecting coastal ecosystems.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Erik""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: ocean","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.earscirev.2023.104501",NA,NA,NA

When viewed on the time scales of climate however, these short‐term corrections, or analysis increments, can closely mirror the systematic bias patterns of the dynamical model. In this study, we use convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to learn a mapping from model state variables to analysis increments, in order to showcase the feasibility of a data‐driven model parameterization which can predict state‐dependent model errors. We undertake this problem using an ice‐ocean data assimilation system within the Seamless system for Prediction and EArth system Research (SPEAR) model, developed at the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory, which assimilates satellite observations of sea ice concentration every 5 days between 1982 and 2017. The CNN then takes inputs of data assimilation forecast states and tendencies, and makes predictions of the corresponding sea ice concentration increments. Specifically, the inputs are states and tendencies of sea ice concentration, sea‐surface temperature, ice velocities, ice thickness, net shortwave radiation, ice‐surface skin temperature, sea‐surface salinity, as well as a land‐sea mask. We find the CNN is able to make skillful predictions of the increments in both the Arctic and Antarctic and across all seasons, with skill that consistently exceeds that of a climatological increment prediction. This suggests that the CNN could be used to reduce sea ice biases in free‐running SPEAR simulations, either as a sea ice parameterization or an online bias correction tool for numerical sea ice forecasts.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Erik""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: ocean","https://doi.org/10.1029/2023ms003757",NA,NA,NA

We train this detector with a combination of annotated datasets of marine debris and evaluate it on specifically selected test sites where it is highly probable that plastic pollution is present in the detected marine debris. We integrate data-centric artificial intelligence principles by devising a training strategy with extensive sampling of negative examples and an automated label refinement of coarse hand labels.

Despite their ecological and economic importance, these species are declining because of human impact. This decline has driven the need for monitoring and mapping to estimate the overall health and dynamics of seagrasses in coastal environments, often based on underwater images. However, seagrass detection from underwater digital images is not a trivial task; it requires taxonomic expertise and is time-consuming and expensive. Recently automatic approaches based on deep learning have revolutionised object detection performance in many computer vision applications, and there has been interest in applying this to automated seagrass detection from imagery. Deep learning–based techniques reduce the need for hardcore feature extraction by domain experts which is required in machine learning-based techniques. This study presents a YOLOv5-based one-stage detector and an EfficientDetD7–based two-stage detector for detecting seagrass, in this case, Halophila ovalis, one of the most widely distributed seagrass species. The EfficientDet-D7–based seagrass detector achieves the highest mAP of 0.484 on the ECUHO-2 dataset and mAP of 0.354 on the ECUHO-1 dataset, which are about 7% and 5% better than the state-of-the-art Halophila ovalis detection performance on those datasets, respectively.

We demonstrate the capability of SmartSim by using it to run a 12-member ensemble of global-scale, high-resolution ocean simulations, each spanning 19 compute nodes, all communicating with the same ML architecture at each simulation timestep. In total, 970 billion inferences are collectively served by running the ensemble for a total of 120 simulated years. The inferences are used to predict the oceanic eddy kinetic energy (EKE), which is a variable that is used to tune different turbulence closures in the model and thus directly affects the simulation. The root-mean-square of the error in EKE (as compared to an eddy-resolving simulation) is 20% lower when using the ML-prediction than the previous state of the art.

It has been suggested that combining multi-spectral satellite information and machine learning approaches are effective to monitor plastic pollutants in the ocean environment. Recent research has made theoretical progress in identifying marine debris and suspected plastic (MD&amp;SP) through machine learning whereas no study has fully explored the application of these methods for mapping and monitoring marine debris density. Therefore, this article consists of three main components: (1) the development and validation of a supervised machine learning marine debris detection model, (2) to map the MD&amp;SP density into an automated tool called MAP-Mapper and finally (3) evaluation of the entire system for out-of-distribution (OOD) test locations. Developed MAP-Mapper architectures provide users with options to achieve high precision ( abbv. -HP) or optimum precision-recall ( abbv. -Opt) values in terms of training/test dataset. Our MAP-Mapper-HP model greatly increases the MD&amp;SP detection precision to 95%, while the MAP-Mapper-Opt achieves 87–88% precision–recall pair. To efficiently measure density mapping findings at OOD test locations, we propose the Marine Debris Map (MDM) index, which combines the average probability of a pixel belonging to the MD&amp;SP class and the number of detections in a given time frame. The high MDM findings of the proposed approach are found to be consistent with existing marine litter and plastic pollution areas, and these are presented with available evidence citing literature and field studies.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Erik""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: ocean","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-33612-2",NA,NA,NA

We noticed that with longer periods of past sea ice extent data and shorter periods of climate data, the results appeared to be better. This might be related to the difference in climate and ocean memory.

Almost half of the world’s organic carbon is fixed by marine phytoplankton, especially during algal blooms, despite accounting for less than one percent of the total photosynthetic biomass on Earth. Nonetheless, there are growing concerns about the rise of harmful algal blooms in terms of their persistence and distribution that is a fingerprint of both global climate and local anthropogenic pressure. A novel forecasting model – combining transfer entropy network inference and a forecasting convolution neural-network – is used to predict bloom and non-bloom epidemic regimes, and their environmental determinants to define bloom sources, causes and systemic risk. The model shows high forecasting skills by extracting salient ecosystem features even without spatial dependencies. We defined a 2D entropic ecosystem mandala where the ecological impact, manifested by the distribution’s randomness of Cyanobacteria-driven chlorophyll-a (CHL-a), is proportional to the systemic environmental pressure/stress determined by a set of erratic ocean/climate and coastal/nutrient factors. Originally, a spatial risk was defined based on CHL-a magnitude, persistence and shifts. Considering the temporal variability of CHL-a in Florida Bay (FL Bay) as a case-study, we show how shifts in algal blooms are becoming more persistent in shallow areas with higher dinoflagellate/diatom ratio. This emphasizes the likely key role of cyanobacteria disorganization into phytoplankton organization, and thus the role of land discharge into the marine microbiome balance. This presents major challenges considering the increasing potential causality of green–blue algal blooms (river-dominated) for harmful red-tides with cascading socio-ecological effects, including carbon cycling alteration and ingrained eutrophication in coastal ecosystems. A universal threshold on the top 20% Pareto CHL-a extremes clearly defines bloom and non-bloom regimes independently of being endemic or epidemic, underpinned by distinct eco-environmental interactions, where the largest biogeochemical stress is structurally scale-free with CHL-a as the hub. Forecasting algal bloom in short- and long-term is indispensable for quantifying ecosystem health considering coastal-marine habitats, species and humans, as well as impacts into environmental processes such as carbon sequestration capacity. However, the increasing disorganization of biogeochemical stress decreases our forecasting ability of algal blooms except during outbreaks when is too late for prevention. This has impacts for investigating and controlling eco-environmental determinants of undesired algal bloom emergence and spread.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Erik""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: ocean","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2023.110760",NA,NA,NA

In this work, we improve a parameterization of vertical mixing in the ocean surface boundary layer by enhancing its eddy diffusivity model using data‐driven methods, specifically neural networks. The neural networks are designed to take extrinsic and intrinsic forcing parameters as input to predict the eddy diffusivity profile and are trained using output data from a second moment closure turbulent mixing scheme. The modified vertical mixing scheme predicts the eddy diffusivity profile through online inference of neural networks and maintains the conservation principles of the standard ocean model equations, which is particularly important for its targeted use in climate simulations.

Several methodologies for reconstructing air‐sea CO 2 exchange from pCO 2 observations indicate larger decadal variability than estimated using ocean models. We develop a new application of multiple Large Ensemble Earth system models to assess these reconstructions' ability to estimate spatiotemporal variability. With our Large Ensemble Testbed, pCO 2 fields from 25 ensemble members each of four independent Earth system models are subsampled as the observations and the reconstruction is performed as it would be with real‐world observations. The power of a testbed is that the perfect reconstruction is known for each of the original model fields; thus, reconstruction skill can be comprehensively assessed. We find that a neural‐network approach can skillfully reconstruct air‐sea CO 2 fluxes when it is trained with sufficient data. Flux bias is low for the global mean and Northern Hemisphere, but can be regionally high in the Southern Hemisphere. The phase and amplitude of the seasonal cycle are accurately reconstructed outside of the tropics, but longer‐term variations are reconstructed with only moderate skill. For Southern Ocean decadal variability, insufficient sampling leads to a 31% (15%:58%, interquartile range) overestimation of amplitude, and phasing is only moderately correlated with known truth ( r = 0.54 [0.46:0.63]). Globally, the amplitude of decadal variability is overestimated by 21% (3%:34%). Machine learning, when supplied with sufficient data, can skillfully reconstruct ocean properties. However, data sparsity remains a fundamental limitation to quantification of decadal variability in the ocean carbon sink.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Erik""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: ocean","https://doi.org/10.1029/2020gb006788",NA,NA,NA

However, historical reconstructions of ocean heat content often neglect a large volume of the deep ocean, due to sparse observations of ocean temperatures below 2000 m. Here, we provide a global reconstruction of historical changes in full-depth ocean heat content based on interpolated subsurface temperature data using an autoregressive artificial neural network, providing estimates of total ocean warming for the period 1946-2019. We find that cooling of the deep ocean and a small heat gain in the upper ocean led to no robust trend in global ocean heat content from 1960-1990, implying a roughly balanced Earth energy budget within −0.16 to 0.06 W m −2 over most of the latter half of the 20th century. However, the past three decades have seen a rapid acceleration in ocean warming, with the entire ocean warming from top to bottom at a rate of 0.63 ± 0.13 W m −2 . These results suggest a delayed onset of a positive Earth energy imbalance relative to previous estimates, although large uncertainties remain.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Erik""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: ocean","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-24472-3",NA,NA,NA

Intertidal areas are exposed to particularly high levels of pressures owing to increased population density in coastal areas. Traditional methods of monitoring intertidal areas do not provide datasets with full coverage in a cost-effective or timely manner, and so the use of remote sensing to monitor these areas is becoming more common. Monitoring of ecologically important monospecific habitats, such as seagrass beds, using remote sensing techniques is well documented. However, the ability for multispectral data to distinguish efficiently and accurately between classes of vegetation with similar pigment composition, such as seagrass and green algae, has proved difficult, often requiring hyperspectral data. A machine learning approach was used to differentiate between soft-bottom intertidal vegetation classes when exposed at low tide, comparing 6 different multi- and hyperspectral remote and in situ sensors. For the library of 366 spectra, collected across Northern Europe, high accuracy (>80%) was found across all spectral resolutions. While a higher spectral resolution resulted in higher accuracy, there was no discernible increase in accuracy above 10 spectral bands (95%: Sentinel-2 MSI sensor with a spatial resolution of 20 m). This work highlights the ability of multispectral sensors to discriminate intertidal vegetation types, while also showing the most important wavelengths for this discrimination (∼530 and ∼ 730 nm), giving recommendations for spectral ranges of future satellite missions. The ability for multispectral sensors to aid in accurate and rapid intertidal vegetation classification at the taxonomic resolution of classes, could be a significant contribution for future sustainable and effective ecosystem management.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Erik""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: ocean","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2023.113554",NA,NA,NA

China has witnessed extensive development of the marine aquaculture industry over recent years. However, such rapid and disordered expansion posed risks to coastal environment, economic development, and biodiversity protection. This study aimed to produce an accurate national-scale marine aquaculture map at a spatial resolution of 16 m, using a proposed model based on deep convolution neural networks (CNNs) and applied it to satellite data from China's GF-1 sensor in an end-to-end way. The analyses used homogeneous CNNs to extract high-dimensional features from the input imagery and preserve information at full resolution. Then, a hierarchical cascade architecture was followed to capture multi-scale features and contextual information. This hierarchical cascade homogeneous neural network (HCHNet) was found to achieve better classification performance than current state-of-the-art models (FCN-32s, Deeplab V2, U-Net, and HCNet). The resulting marine aquaculture area map has an overall classification accuracy &gt; 95 % (95.2 %–96.4, 95 % confidence interval). And marine aquaculture was found to cover a total area of ∼ 1100 km2 (1096.8–1110.6 km2, 95 % confidence interval) in China, of which more than 85 % is marine plant culture areas, with 87 % found in the Fujian, Shandong, Liaoning, and Jiangsu provinces. The results confirm the applicability and effectiveness of HCHNet when applied to GF-1 data, identifying notable spatial distributions of different marine aquaculture areas and supporting the sustainable management and ecological assessments of coastal resources at a national scale.

However, they are being destroyed at an alarming rate by human activities. To characterize mangrove forest changes, evaluate their impacts, and support relevant protection and restoration decision making, accurate and up-to-date mangrove extent mapping at large spatial scales is essential. Available large-scale mangrove extent data products use a single machine learning method commonly with 30 m Landsat imagery, and significant inconsistencies remain among these data products. With huge amounts of satellite data involved and the heterogeneity of land surface characteristics across large geographic areas, finding the most suitable method for large-scale high-resolution mangrove mapping is a challenge. The objective of this study is to evaluate the performance of a machine learning ensemble for mangrove forest mapping at 20 m spatial resolution across West Africa using Sentinel-2 (optical) and Sentinel-1 (radar) imagery. The machine learning ensemble integrates three commonly used machine learning methods in land cover and land use mapping, including Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), and Neural Network (NN). The cloud-based big geospatial data processing platform Google Earth Engine (GEE) was used for pre-processing Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-1 data. Extensive validation has demonstrated that the machine learning ensemble can generate mangrove extent maps at high accuracies for all study regions in West Africa (92%–99% Producer’s Accuracy, 98%–100% User’s Accuracy, 95%–99% Overall Accuracy). This is the first-time that mangrove extent has been mapped at a 20 m spatial resolution across West Africa. The machine learning ensemble has the potential to be applied to other regions of the world and is therefore capable of producing high-resolution mangrove extent maps at global scales periodically.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Erik""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: ocean","https://doi.org/10.3389/feart.2020.560933",NA,NA,NA

There are, however, important regional differences, resulting from distinct processes at different timescales (temperature-driven changes being a major contributor on multi-year timescales). In view of this complexity, it deems essential to move towards more sophisticated data-driven techniques as well as diagnostic and prognostic prediction models to interpret observations of ocean warming and sea level variations at local or regional sea basins. In this context, we present a machine learning approach that exploits key ocean temperature estimates (as proxies for the regional thermosteric sea level component) to model coastal sea level variability and associated uncertainty across a range of timescales (from months to several years). Our findings also demonstrate the utility of machine learning to estimate the possible tendency of near-future regional sea levels. When compared to actual sea-level records, our models perform particularly well in the coastal areas most influenced by internal climate variability. Yet, the models are widely applicable to evaluate the patterns of rising and falling sea levels across many places around the globe. Thus, our approach is a promising tool to model and anticipate sea level changes in the coming (1–3) years, which is crucial for near-term decision making and strategic planning about coastal protection measures.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Erik""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: ocean","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-87460-z",NA,NA,NA

The DFE scheme automatically extracts the hidden patterns of IoT-enabled MTS network and its output is used by CTIDD scheme for threat detection.

A range of spatially and temporally variable harmful algal bloom species (HABs) impact the industry through their production of biotoxins that accumulate and concentrate in shellfish flesh, which negatively impact the health of consumers through consumption. Regulatory monitoring of harmful cells in the water column and toxin concentrations within shellfish flesh are currently the main means of warning of elevated toxin events in bivalves, with harvesting being suspended when toxicity is elevated above EU regulatory limits. However, while such an approach is generally successful in safeguarding human health, it does not provide the early warning that is needed to support business planning and harvesting by the aquaculture industry. To address this issue, a proliferation of web portals have been developed to make monitoring data widely accessible. These systems are now transitioning from “nowcasts” to operational Early Warning Systems (EWS) to better mitigate against HAB-generated harmful effects. To achieve this, EWS are incorporating a range of environmental data parameters and developing varied forecasting approaches.

Conversely, less diverse plankton assemblages were observed in waters with higher SST and/or deep mixed layers when sea ice extent was lower. A genetic programming machine-learning model explained up to 80% of the net community production variability at the Western Antarctic Peninsula. Among the biological explanatory variables, the sea-ice environment associated plankton assemblage is the best predictor of net community production. We conclude that eukaryotic plankton diversity and carbon cycling at the Western Antarctic Peninsula are strongly linked to sea-ice conditions.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Erik""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: ocean","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-25235-w",NA,NA,NA

Due to climate change and sea level rise, sustainable management of coastal areas involves extensive exploration, monitoring, and protection. Current high-resolution remote sensing methods for monitoring these areas include bathymetric LiDAR. Therefore, this study presents a novel methodological approach to assess the suitability of Airborne LiDAR Bathymetry for automatic classification and mapping of the seafloor. Nine classes of geomorphological bedforms and three classes of anthropogenic structures were identified. They were automatically mapped by Geographic Object-Based Image Analysis and machine learning supervised classifiers. The developed method was applied to six study sites and a 48 km submerged coastal zone in the Southern Baltic, achieving an overall accuracy of up to 94%. This study shows that calculation of the Multiresolution Index of Ridge Top Flatness (secondary feature) can be used to quickly and automatically determine sandbar crests and ridge tops. The methodical approach developed in this study can help evaluate and protect other shallow coastal environments and coastal protection structures.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Erik""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: ocean","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.enggeo.2022.106615",NA,NA,NA
"rayyan-100678257","Global Distribution of Zooplankton Biomass Estimated by In Situ Imaging and Machine Learning",NA,1,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"en",NA,NA,"Zooplankton plays a major role in ocean food webs and biogeochemical cycles, and provides major ecosystem services as a main driver of the biological carbon pump and in sustaining fish communities. Zooplankton is also sensitive to its environment and reacts to its changes. To better understand the importance of zooplankton, and to inform prognostic models that try to represent them, spatially-resolved biomass estimates of key plankton taxa are desirable. In this study we predict, for the first time, the global biomass distribution of 19 zooplankton taxa (1-50 mm Equivalent Spherical Diameter) using observations with the Underwater Vision Profiler 5, a quantitative in situ imaging instrument. After classification of 466,872 organisms from more than 3,549 profiles (0-500 m) obtained between 2008 and 2019 throughout the globe, we estimated their individual biovolumes and converted them to biomass using taxa-specific conversion factors. We then associated these biomass estimates with climatologies of environmental variables (temperature, salinity, oxygen, etc.), to build habitat models using boosted regression trees. The results reveal maximal zooplankton biomass values around 60°N and 55°S as well as minimal values around the oceanic gyres. An increased zooplankton biomass is also predicted for the equator. Global integrated biomass (0-500 m) was estimated at 0.403 PgC. It was largely dominated by Copepoda (35.7%, mostly in polar regions), followed by Eumalacostraca (26.6%) Rhizaria (16.4%, mostly in the intertropical convergence zone). The machine learning approach used here is sensitive to the size of the training set and generates reliable predictions for abundant groups such as Copepoda (R2 ≈ 20-66%) but not for rare ones (Ctenophora, Cnidaria, R2 &amp;lt; 5%). Still, this study offers a first protocol to estimate global, spatially resolved zooplankton biomass and community composition from in situ imaging observations of individual organisms. The underlying dataset covers a period of 10 years while approaches that rely on net samples utilized datasets gathered since the 1960s. Increased use of digital imaging approaches should enable us to obtain zooplankton biomass distribution estimates at basin to global scales in shorter time frames in the future.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Erik""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: ocean","https://doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2022.894372",NA,NA,NA
"rayyan-100678271","The Oceans’ Biological Carbon Pumps: Framework for a Research Observational Community Approach",NA,1,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"en",NA,NA,"A recent paradigm explains that the downward pumping of biogenic carbon in the ocean is performed by the combined action of six different biological carbon pumps (BCPs): the biological gravitational pump, the physically driven pumps (Mixed Layer Pump, Eddy Subduction Pump and Large-scale Subduction Pump), and the animal-driven pumps (diurnal and seasonal vertical migrations of zooplankton and larger animals). Here, we propose a research community approach to implement the new paradigm through the integrated study of these BCPs in the World Ocean. The framework to investigate the BCPs combines measurements from different observational platforms, i.e. , oceanographic ships, satellites, moorings, and robots (gliders, floats, and robotic surface vehicles such as wavegliders and saildrones). We describe the following aspects of the proposed research framework: variables and processes to be measured in both the euphotic and twilight zones for the different BCPs; spatial and temporal scales of occurrence of the various BCPs; selection of key regions for integrated studies of the BCPs; multi-platform observational strategies; and upscaling of results from regional observations to the global ocean using deterministic models combined with data assimilation and machine learning to make the most of the wealth of unique measurements. The proposed approach has the potential not only to bring together a large multidisciplinary community of researchers, but also to usher the community toward a new era of discoveries in ocean sciences.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Erik""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: ocean","https://doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2021.780052",NA,NA,NA
