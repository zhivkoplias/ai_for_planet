rayyan-224199434,Application of Random Forest and ICON Models Combined with Weather Forecasts to Predict Soil Temperature and Water Content in a Greenhouse,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Climate change might potentially cause extreme weather events to become more frequent and intense. It could also enhance water scarcity and reduce food security. More efficient water management techniques are thus required to ensure a stable food supply and quality. Maintaining proper soil water content and soil temperature is necessary for efficient water management in agricultural practices. The usage of water and fertilizers can be significantly improved with a precise water content prediction tool. In this study, we proposed a new framework that combines weather forecast data, numerical models, and machine learning methods to simulate and predict the soil temperature and volumetric water content in a greenhouse. To test the framework, we performed greenhouse experiments with cherry tomatoes. The numerical models and machine learning methods we selected were Newton’s law of cooling, HYDRUS-1D, the random forest model, and the ICON (inferring connections of networks) model. The measured air temperature, soil temperature, and volumetric water content during the cultivation period were used for model calibration and validation. We compared the performances of the models for soil temperature and volumetric water content predictions. The results showed that the random forest model performed a more accurate prediction than other methods under the limited information provided from greenhouse experiments. This approach provides a framework that can potentially learn best water management practices from experienced farmers and provide intelligent information for smart greenhouse management.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/w12041176,"",,
rayyan-224199446,A comparative study of artificial intelligence models for predicting monthly river suspended sediment load,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"When high precision modelling is required, for example, with the estimation of suspended sediment load (SSL), data-driven models are preferred over physically-based numerical models for their real-time, short-horizon prediction ability. The investigation of SSL, as an important index in engineering practices assessment, like design and operation of the hydraulic structures not only shows the hydrological behaviour of the river, but also illustrates the valuable information about the water quality deterioration, surface-groundwater interaction and land-use changes of the watershed. The following data-driven methods were compared in order to predict SSL at the Seyra gauging station on the Karaj River in Iran: Fuzzy logic (FL), two adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference systems (i.e., ANFIS-GP and ANFIS-FCM models), an artificial neural network (ANN), and least squares support vector machine (LSSVM). Monthly average river flow and SSL data for 50 years were obtained from the Tehran Regional Water Authority (TRWA). The data was first divided into training, validation and test sets and the SSL was then predicted using the ANN, FL, ANFIS, and LSSVM models. The reliability of the applied models was evaluated by the correlation coefficient (R), root mean square error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE). The results showed that the ANFIS models outperformed the ANN, FL, and LSSVM models for predicting SSL using the given input and output data. Overall, the performances of the artificial intelligence models used in the present study were satisfac-tory in predicting the non-linear behaviour of the SSL.","",https://doi.org/10.24425/jwld.2020.133052,"",,
rayyan-224199460,Water allocation using game theory under climate change impact (case study: Zarinehrood),,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract The combined effects of climate change and growing water demand due to population growth, industrial and agricultural developments cause an increase in water scarcity and the subsequent environmental crisis in river basins, which results in conflicts over the property rights and allocation agreements. Thus, an integrated, sustainable and efficient water allocation considering changes in water resources due to climate change and change of users' demands is necessary. In this study, the drainage basin of Zarinehrood was chosen to evaluate the function of selective methods. Assessing climate change impact scenarios of the Fifth IPCC reports, e.g., RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6.0 and RCP8.5, have been used. For downscaling outputs of GCMs an artificial neural network (ANN) and for bias correction a quantile mapping (QM) method have been used. Using a bargaining game and the Nash bargaining solution (NBS) with two methods, one symmetric and two AHP methods, the water available for users was allocated. Results indicate an overall increase in temperature and precipitation in the basin. In bargaining game solutions, AHP provided better utilities for players than the symmetric method. These results show that with water management programs and use of a cooperative bargaining game, water allocation can be done in an efficient way.","",https://doi.org/10.2166/wcc.2020.153,"",,

This review will identify underlying models, theories and frameworks applied to the mines, and used to ""smartly"" treat and manage mine water. The aim is to provide informed details about these technologies in order to move the mine water management sector to the Industrial-Internet of Things (IIoT). The Internet of Things (IoT), Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN), artificial intelligence, swarming drones and automation are the most widely used smart technologies in current industries, especially the mining industry. In recent years, automation has seen substantial growth in the mines, for example, self-driving trucks. In addition, a lot of work that usually was done by humans can be performed better and safer by machines and drones. WSN are used for automated measurement systems, especially for collecting flow data and physico-chemical parameters for managing and treating mine water. All of these are operated through the main smart technology which is the IoT. It is expected that these technologies will positively affect the mining industry in the long run, making it possible for the mines to reach their expected full-scale production more easily. In this study, latest digital technologies to optimise mine water management and state-of-the-art mines are reviewed and described. In addition, the advantages of using these digital technologies are investigated.","",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wri.2020.100136,"",,
rayyan-224199478,Self‐Validating Deep Learning for Recovering Terrestrial Water Storage From Gravity and Altimetry Measurements,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract Quantifying and monitoring terrestrial water storage (TWS) is an essential task for understanding the Earth's hydrosphere cycle, its susceptibility to climate change, and concurrent impacts for ecosystems, agriculture, and water management. Changes in TWS manifest as anomalies in the Earth's gravity field, which are routinely observed from space. However, the complex underlying distribution of water masses in rivers, lakes, or groundwater basins remains elusive. We combine machine learning, numerical modeling, and satellite altimetry to build a downscaling neural network that recovers simulated TWS from synthetic space‐borne gravity observations. A novel constrained training is introduced, allowing the neural network to validate its training progress with independent satellite altimetry records. We show that the neural network can accurately derive the TWS in 2019 after being trained over the years 2003 to 2018. Further, we demonstrate that the constrained neural network can outperform the numerical model in validated regions.","",https://doi.org/10.1029/2020gl089258,"",,

However, the availability of streamflow observations limits the utilization of the state-of-the-art streamflow prediction techniques to the basins where hydrometric gauging stations exist. Since the most river basins in the world are ungauged, the development of the specialized techniques for the reliable streamflow prediction in ungauged basins (PUB) is of crucial importance. In recent years, the emerging field of deep learning provides a myriad of new models that can breathe new life into the stagnating PUB methods. In the presented study, we benchmark the streamflow prediction efficiency of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks against the standard technique of GR4J hydrological model parameters regionalization (HMREG) at 200 basins in Northwest Russia. Results show that the LSTM-based regional hydrological model significantly outperforms the HMREG scheme in terms of median Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), which is 0.73 and 0.61 for LSTM and HMREG, respectively. Moreover, LSTM demonstrates the comparable median NSE with that for basin-scale calibration of GR4J (0.75). Therefore, this study underlines the high utilization potential of deep learning for the PUB by demonstrating the new state-of-the-art performance in this field.","",https://doi.org/10.1051/e3sconf/202016301001,"",,
rayyan-224199564,Using Machine Learning to Integrate On-Farm Sensors and Agro-Meteorology Networks into Site-Specific Decision Support,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Highlights Machine learning can incorporate a variety of data from low-cost sensors and estimate actual ET by comparison with short-term, higher-cost measurements. On-farm weather monitoring can be leveraged to estimate site-specific crop-water requirements. Expanding spatial coverage of weather and actual ET through on-farm monitoring will facilitate localization and leverage publicly available weather data to guide irrigation decisions and improve irrigation water management. Abstract . One of the basic challenges to adopting science-based irrigation scheduling is providing reliable, site-specific estimates of actual crop water demand. While agro-meteorology networks cover most agricultural production areas in the U.S., widely spaced stations represent regionally specific, rather than site-specific, conditions. A variety of low to moderate cost commercial weather stations are available but do not provide directly useful information, such as actual evapotranspiration (ETa), or the ability to incorporate additional sensors. We demonstrate that machine learning methods can provide real-time, site-specific information about ETa and crop water demand using on-farm sensors and public weather information. Two years of field experiments were conducted at four irrigated field sites with crops including snap beans, alfalfa, and pasture. On-farm data were compared to publicly available data originating at nearby agro-meteorology network stations. The machine learning procedure can robustly estimate ETa using data from a few basic sensors, but the resulting estimate is sensitive to the range of conditions that are used as training data. The results demonstrate that machine learning can be used with affordable sensors and publicly available data to improve local estimates of crop water demand when high-quality measurements can be co-located for short periods of time. Supplementary sensors can also be integrated into a tailored monitoring plan to estimate crop stress and other operational considerations.

rayyan-224199609,Suspended sediment modelling with hydrological and climate input data,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract Measured records of suspended sediment concentrations are vital information to support water management activities. However, these measured time series are often incomplete and, as such, are not suitable for some analyses. This paper sets out the options for modelling suspended sediment concentrations to determine them in periods when measurements were not performed. The Danube River profile in Bratislava was selected as the case study. Regression using least absolute selection and shrinkage operator, support vector regression and deep learning neural network are compared in the paper to solve this task using various data sources. The results obtained show a significant increase in the precision of modelling suspended sediment concentrations over the standard method, which is a rating curve. Several variables were used to establish the suspended sediment concentration, because the same data as in this study may not be available everywhere. In particular, the use of climatic (precipitation and temperature) and hydrological inputs (flows) is assessed in order to promote the more general benefit of work. In the article, the authors propose an original method of modification of input climate data, which significantly increases the accuracy of modelling. The authors demonstrate that when using proposed methodology, the use of climate data, which are usually better available than hydrological data, resulted in a comparable degree of precision to standard modelling based on river flow data.","",https://doi.org/10.2166/hydro.2020.116,"",,
rayyan-224199672,Applying Observed Rainfall and Deep Neural Network for Urban Flood Analysis,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Urban flooding primarily occurs due to flash floods in low-lying regions or insufficient capacity of drainage systems. Urban inundation has become more dangerous to residents because of an increase in impermeable areas, uncertainties in urban sewage planning, and the accumulation of sedimentation in drainage pipes. As an urban watershed with a drainage system and an urbanized river is complicated, a specific time interval is required for the preparation and processing of urban runoff analysis. To allow for rapid simulations of urban runoff estimation during heavy rainfall, a deep neural network model that imitates the conditions of a 6-h duration rainfall was developed in this study. Ten different statistical aspects for each rainfall event were considered as input data, and the total accumulated overflow from a manhole was calculated at intervals of 10 min using storm water management model (SWMM). To verify the accuracy of the results from SWMM, the results obtained from a two-dimensional hydraulic model and an inundation trace map were compared. The computational times for the deep neural network and rainfall data-based models proposed in this study were estimated to be within 1 s, whereas the simulation using SWMM required 14 min. The proposed deep learning model was tested using the total accumulated overflow for the rainfall event observed at Gangnam (400) automatic weather station on July 27, 2011. The simulated results agreed with the observed results in terms of the total accumulated discharge.","",https://doi.org/10.9798/kosham.2020.20.1.339,"",,

Abu-Ziriq Marsh, located in the south of Iraq, is chosen as the case study for the application of the proposed methodology. The aim of this study was to assess the ability of using three different models of Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques: Adaptive Neural-based Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Multiple Regression Model (MLR) to predict and estimate the discharge of Abu-Ziriq Marsh by depending on flow release from upstream Al-Badaa regulator. Daily discharge of Al-Badaa regulator( Q B ) and Abu-Ziriq Marsh( Q z ) were used in this study. The water quantity data, consisting of 720 records of daily data between the years 2017 and 2018, were used for training and testing the models. The training and testing data were randomly partitioned into 515 (70.5 %) and 215 (29.5 %) datasets, respectively. The performance of all models was assessed through the correlation coefficient (R), root mean square error ( RMSE ) and Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient ( NSE ). Results of RMSE, R and NSE for the calibration (validation) of ANFIS model were 4.11 (4.17), 0.87 (0.83) and 0.76 (0.70), respectively.

rayyan-224199721,Using Long Short-Term Memory networks to connect water table depth anomalies to precipitation anomalies over Europe,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract. Many European countries mainly rely on groundwater for domestic water use. Due to a scarcity of near real-time water table depth (wtd) observations, establishing a spatially consistent groundwater monitoring system at the continental scale is a challenge. Hence, it is necessary to develop alternative methods to estimate wtd anomalies (wtda) using other hydrometeorological observations routinely available near real-time. In this work, we explore the potential of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to produce monthly wtda, using monthly precipitation anomalies (pra) as input. LSTM networks are a special category of artificial neural networks, useful in detecting a long-term dependency within sequences, in our case time series, which is expected in the relationship between pra and wtda. To set up the methodology, spatio-temporally continuous data were obtained from daily terrestrial simulations (hereafter termed the TSMP-G2A data set) with a spatial resolution of 0.11°, ranging from the year 1996 to 2016. They were separated into a training set (1996–2012), a validation set (2013–2014), and a test set (2015–2016) to establish local networks at selected pixels across Europe.

rayyan-224199778,Estimating Soil Available Phosphorus Content through Coupled Wavelet–Data-Driven Models,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Soil phosphorus (P) is a vital but limited element which is usually leached from the soil via the drainage process. Soil phosphorus as a soluble substance can be delivered through agricultural fields by runoff or soil loss. It is one of the most essential nutrients that affect the sustainability of crops as well as the energy transfer for living organisms. Therefore, an accurate simulation of soil phosphorus, which is considered as a point source pollutant in elevated contents, must be performed. Considering a crucial issue for a sustainable soil and water management, an effective soil phosphorus assessment in the current research was conducted with the aim of examining the capability of five different wavelet-based data-driven models: gene expression programming (GEP), neural networks (NN), random forest (RF), multivariate adaptive regression spline (MARS), and support vector machine (SVM) in modeling soil phosphorus (P). In order to achieve this goal, several parameters, including soil pH, organic carbon (OC), clay content, and soil P data, were collected from different regions of the Neyshabur plain, Khorasan-e-Razavi Province (Northeast Iran). First, a discrete wavelet transform (DWT) was applied to the pH, OC, and clay as the inputs and their subcomponents were utilized in the applied data-driven techniques. Statistical Gamma test was also used for identifying which effective soil parameter is able to influence soil P. The applied methods were assessed through 10-fold cross-validation scenarios.

rayyan-224199792,Regional wetland water storage changes: The influence of future climate on geographically isolated wetlands,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Geographically Isolated Wetlands (GIWs) are essential ecological and ecosystem entities that are vulnerable to climate change. The water storage volume (WSV) of GIWs is an important indicator to monitor their health and ecosystem services. Therefore, the projection of changes in future WSV of GIWs is crucial for conservation policies that are typically set at the regional scale. A limiting factor for the extended spatial projection of WSV of GIWs is the lack of data on their geometry, bathymetry, and the complexity of hydrologic relation to the surrounding drainage basin and the climate at a regional scale. In this study, we developed a hybrid Machine Learning (ML) – hydrologic modelling approach, from which a number of indices and variables derived to assess WSV of GIWs. We projected future changes in WSV of about a hundred thousand GIWs across 17 large river basins in western Canada, using a nine-model ensemble climate simulations under two greenhouse gas emissions scenarios (i.e., RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5). We estimated the baseline WSV by developing ML models using water depth measurements and geographical information features from 234 surveyed GIWs across the study area. Future WSV was quantified using a three-step procedure, where water balance simulations were facilitated through the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) for the 2018–2034 period, and GIW specific mass-balance components were adapted using remote sensing data. The spatiotemporal analysis of the WSV offers new insights, and reveals (1) a baseline provincial WSV of 550 million m3, with an average of 5,508 m3 per GIW, (2) a decreasing future WSV at annual rates of −2.58 and −2.62 million m3 for RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5, respectively, and (3) the minimum and maximum WSV loss rates occurring during October and February, respectively, and (4) a diverse trend and magnitude of changes in WSV across 17 river basins. Finally, we state that while a group of hydrologic, climatic, and geographic processes and factors drives WSV of GIWs, the dominating driving force in WSV trends might be spatially and temporally different depending on the environmental conditions and characteristics of river basins and their associated GIWs. This study facilitates a better understanding of the connections between the WSV of GIWs and watershed-scale hydrology and climate change across multiple spatial scales.","",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2020.106941,"",,

Vegetation interact closely with water resources. Conventional studies of plant-water relations at the field scale are fundamental for understanding the mechanisms of how plants alter and adapt to environmental changes, while large-scale studies can be more practical for regional land use and water management towards mitigating climate change impacts. In this study, we investigated the changes in total water storage (TWS), aridity index (AI) and vegetation greenness, productivity and their interactions in the Pearl River Basin since 2002. Results show overall increase of TWS especially in the middle reaches where vegetation greenness and productivity also increased. This region dominated by croplands was identified as the hotspot for changes and interactions between water and vegetation in the basin. Vegetation was more strongly affected by TWS than precipitation (P) at both the annual and monthly scales. Further examination showed that the influence of P on vegetation in wet years was stronger than dry years, while the TWS impact was stronger in dry years than wet years; moreover, greenness responded faster and productivity slower to dryness changes in dry years than wet years. The lag effects resulted in nonlinearity between water and vegetation. This study implies that vegetation in the basin uses rainwater prior to water storage until it gets dry, and the degree of water restriction on vegetation was higher than that of water consumption by vegetation even in this rain-abundant region.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-2020-242,"",,

Such methods are applied in PUB regionalization or the transfer of a streamflow model from gauged to ungauged (sub) basins or watersheds after grouping watersheds on similarity rules. Regionalized streamflow models are needed for tropical-mountainous regions like Luzon, Philippines - where gauged data is limited - but demands on streamflow modelling for water resources accounting and management are high. In 21 watersheds in Luzon, we “regionalize” RF streamflow models after grouping watersheds based on: a principal components analysis (PCA-clustered), by major river basins (basin-clustered), whole study area scale (one-clustered). Another method without watershed grouping (watershed-level) was also included and inter-compared. Among the four methods, goodness-of-fit evaluations revealed that PCA-clustered method was higher by at most 0.35 coefficient of determination R 2 and 0.31 nash-sutcliffe efficiency NSE , and the least bias in 8 of 12 monthly flows. These are attributed to the added-value of homogeneous watershed grouping, reflected by higher importance (to RF models), of static covariates from open and high-resolution data. Normalized errors from monthly streamflow showed a clear bias (least with the PCA-clustered metohd), linked to season and water management practices in the study area.

A major challenge regarding bathing water management is that concentrations of fecal bacteria may show spatial and temporal variability. In urban rivers, discharges from CSO and stormwater may contain high amounts of fecal bacteria and contaminate bathing water quality. Bathing water surveillance in Europe is only based on monthly grab samples and event-scale variability is detected only by chance as pollution events may occur between sampling intervals.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The ALERT System is currently tested in Berlin and Paris using side by side laboratory comparison to understand temporal variability and spatial bacterial distribution in the local rivers (Seine, Marne and Spree).

All tests showed that the Red-Yellow Argisol showed a high infiltration speed, and in the pasture area the BIV values were 1.9 times higher than those obtained in the forest area. The R² determination coefficients for all curves are 0.99 in all tests and demonstrate the strong correlation between the data. The APE of the calculated and estimated IS values were low, and the biggest discrepancies that occurred were (APE = 0.30%) in the MN - 4 test and (APE = -0.01%) in the AT - 4. APE of MN mode BIVs for AT was 2.7%. These differences in IS values are reflected in the accumulated infiltration (AI) in the soil over time, and in this study the AI of the ATs tests was on average 4.1mm higher than in the MN tests, which corresponds to a difference of 41m³ ha-1. It was concluded that the use of the Arduino microcontroller with the ultrasonic sensor installed in the ring infiltrometer proved to be efficient in the field measurements and made the determination of the accumulated infiltration and the infiltration speed practical, proving to be an economical and technically viable alternative mainly due to the quantity of possible points to collect for each test and the greater reliability added to the low error values when compared to the manual.","",https://doi.org/10.4136/ambi-agua.2543,"",,
rayyan-224200079,GloFAS-ERA5 operational global river discharge reanalysis 1979-present,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Estimating how much water is flowing through rivers at the global scale is challenging due to a lack of observations in space and time. A way forward is to optimally combine the global network of Earth system observations with advanced Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models to generate consistent spatio-temporal maps of land, ocean, and atmospheric variables of interest, known as a reanalysis. While the current generation of NWP output runoff at each grid cell, they currently do not produce river discharge at catchment scales directly, and thus have limited utility in hydrological applications such as flood and drought monitoring and forecasting. This is overcome in the Global Flood Awareness System (GloFAS; http://www.globalfloods.eu/) by coupling surface and sub-surface runoff from the HTESSEL land surface model used within ECMWF&amp;amp;#8217;s latest global atmospheric reanalysis (ERA5) with the LISFLOOD hydrological and channel routing model.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This work presents the new GloFAS-ERA5 global river discharge reanalysis dataset launched on 5 November 2019 (version 2.1 release). The river discharge reanalysis is a global gridded dataset with a horizontal resolution of 0.1&amp;amp;#176; at a daily time step. An innovative feature is that it is produced in an operational environment so is available to users from 1 January 1979 until near real time (2 to 5 days behind real time). The reanalysis was evaluated against a global network of 1801 river discharge observation stations. Results found that the GloFAS-ERA5 reanalysis was skilful against a mean flow benchmark in 86 % of catchments according to the modified Kling-Gupta Efficiency Skill Score, although the strength of skill varied considerably with location. The global median Pearson correlation coefficient was 0.61 with an interquartile range of 0.44 to 0.74. The long-term and operational nature of the GloFAS-ERA5 reanalysis dataset provides a valuable dataset to the user community for large scale hydrology applications ranging from monitoring global flood and drought conditions, understanding hydroclimatic variability and change, initialising hydrological forecasts, and as raw input to post-processing and machine learning methods that can add further value.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Data availibility:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; The dataset is openly available from the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) Climate Data Store (C3S): https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/cems-glofas-historical?tab=overview and further details and the evaluation of the dataset can be found in the accompanying data description paper:&amp;amp;#160;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Data paper:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; Harrigan, S., Zsoter, E., Alfieri, L., Prudhomme, C., Salamon, P., Wetterhall, F., Barnard, C., Cloke, H., and Pappenberger, F.: GloFAS-ERA5 operational global river discharge reanalysis 1979&amp;amp;#8211;present, Earth Syst.

rayyan-224200234,Assessing the Suitability of A Posteriori Random Forests for Downscaling Climate Change Projections,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Statistical downscaling (SD) methods are extensively used to provide high-resolution climate information based on the coarse outputs from Global Climate Models (GCM). In the context of climate change and under the perfect prognosis approach, these methods learn the relationships that link several large-scale predictor variables coming from a reanalysis (e.g. humidity) with the local variables of interest (e.g. precipitation) over a reference historical period. Subsequently, the so-learnt relationships are applied to GCM predictors to obtain downscaled projections for a future period.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In a recent paper, Legasa et al. (2021) introduced a posteriori random forests (AP-RFs), a modification of classical random forests which make use of all the data in the leaves to estimate any probability distribution. Following the experimental framework proposed in Experiment 1 of VALUE (http://www.value-cost.eu, Guti&amp;amp;#233;rrez et al. 2018), the study showed that AP-RFs obtained reliable stochastic time-series over several locations in Europe using reanalysis predictors. As compared to more classical techniques like generalized linear models (GLMs), this study concluded that AP-RFs are a competitive SD method in terms of different forecast aspects, with one of their key advantages being the ability to automatically perform predictor/feature selection. This avoids the task of manually selecting the most adequate large-scale variables and geographical domain of interest, something which, at present, relies on human expertise and constitutes a substantial source of uncertainty for downscaling climate change projections.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Nevertheless, an assessment of the suitability of AP-RFs for producing local climate change projections from GCM predictors is still lacking. This work aims to fill this gap by providing a fair comparison of AP-RFs with GLMs and state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which were recently shown to provide satisfactory results for this task (Ba&amp;amp;#241;o-Medina et al. 2021). We build on VALUE&amp;amp;#8217;s Experiment 2a and train the different methods considered using ERA-Interim &amp;amp;#8220;perfect&amp;amp;#8221; predictors. Afterwards, the EC-Earth model is used to generate downscaled projections for 86 locations distributed across Europe under a strong emission scenario, the RCP8.5.&amp;amp;#160;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Our preliminary results suggest that AP-RFs generate plausible downscaled future projections of precipitation. In particular, differently to traditional GLMs, which are very sensitive to the predictor set considered and may produce implausible climate change projections (Manzanas et al. 2020), this technique yields delta changes consistent with those obtained from both the raw EC-EARTH outputs and the CNNs.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;References&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Ba&amp;amp;#241;o-Medina, J., Manzanas, R. &amp;amp; Guti&amp;amp;#233;rrez, J.M. &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;On the suitability of deep convolutional neural &amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;networks for continental-wide downscaling of climate change projections&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;.

However, these numerical simulators have difficulties representing precipitation events accurately, mainly due to limited spatial resolution when simulating multi-scale dynamics in the atmosphere. To improve the prediction of high resolution precipitation we apply a Deep Learning (DL) approach using an input of CM simulations of the model fields (weather variables) that are more predictable than local precipitation. To this end, we present TRU-NET (Temporal Recurrent U-Net), an encoder-decoder model featuring a novel 2D cross attention mechanism between contiguous convolutional-recurrent layers to effectively model multi-scale spatio-temporal weather processes. We use a conditional-continuous loss function to capture the zero-skewed %extreme event patterns of rainfall. Experiments show that our model consistently attains lower RMSE and MAE scores than a DL model prevalent in short term precipitation prediction and improves upon the rainfall predictions of a state-of-the-art dynamical weather model. Moreover, by evaluating the performance of our model under various, training and testing, data formulation strategies, we show that there is enough data for our deep learning approach to output robust, high-quality results across seasons and varying regions.","",https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2008.09090,"",,

To combat the increasing impact of drought disasters, the International Red Cross Red Crescent Movement focuses on Anticipatory Action. The indication of the status quo of droughts is vital in the anticipation of natural disasters. This indication is potentially benefitted by data on the freshwater reserves. Global Water Watch, being developed by Deltares, WRI, and WWF, is the first online platform providing open access, transparent, and near real-time information on the (historic) water dynamics of fresh surface water resources across the globe, ranging from small to large water bodies. The dataset ranges from 1985 to the present and is derived from earth observation data using artificial intelligence on a global scale. In the scope of Human Centred Design, co-design sessions were held with representatives of Red Cross Red Crescent National Societies in Mozambique, Eswatini, and Zimbabwe. The results were analyzed in a persona journey, gap analysis, and product definition. This resulted in the identification of five potential products of Global Water Watch, related to Anticipatory Action as well as responsive action, the traditional disaster management method used by National Societies. The priority in the recommendation was based on the products their effort in development, relative to their impact. Products that are considered low-hanging fruits in development (high impact, low effort) are monitoring surface waters in near-real-time, and the service of providing data in an API. This ensures that the data can be used in the Impact Based Forecasting platform, developed by 510. Over the long run, a reservoir volume monitor in near-real-time is recommended (high impact, high effort). Also, a long-term recommendation is a product that ensures the export of data in a specific format that can be easily read and shared via email and WhatsApp (low impact, low effort). Last, a product that estimates the future volume of reservoirs (high impact, high effort) could be considered. However, it is not sure if the impact is worth the effort, especially in a situation where a reservoir volume monitor in near-real-time might already be in place.&amp;amp;#160;&amp;amp;#160;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu22-12660,"",,
rayyan-224200437,Hybrid Modelling of Land-Atmosphere Fluxes: Estimating Evapotranspiration using Combined Physics-Based and Data-Driven Machine Learning,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Evapotranspiration (ET) is a central water flux in the global hydrological cycle, closely coupled to the energy balance and carbon cycle. It is primarily governed by non-linear energy processes controlled by meteorological conditions as well as different heterogeneous properties of the ecosystem. Various physical models of ET are widely used, such as the Penman-Monteith (PM) equation, which preserves physical laws and accounts for phenomenological behavior. However, these mechanistic models are often subject to large uncertainties, largely due to the limited understanding of the biological controls, particularly how plants control the land-to-atmosphere water flux by closing and opening their stomata.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Here, we propose a data-adaptive hybrid modeling approach for ET that combines the physics-based PM equation with machine learning (ML) by inferring the biological and aerodynamic regulator of the evaporative water flux from observations. Specifically, the framework comprises setting up a feed-forward neural network and integrating the physically-constraining PM equation in the loss function of the latent heat flux (LE). The stomatal resistance (r&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;s&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt;) and aerodynamic resistance (r&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;a&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt;) are modeled as intermediate latent variables, based on micro-meteorological observations collected and curated in the FLUXNET database.&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;For baseline comparison, two conceptually different ML models have been set up, where the first model simulates LE directly without imposing any physical constraints and the second model is an alternative pseudo-hybrid model approach [1], where the main distinction lies in the formulation of the loss function.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#160;Our hybrid model is capable of capturing the diurnal and seasonal variations between the mean values of predicted and observed LE.

A way to mitigate this looming problem is to increase agricultural Crop Water Productivity (CWP) by improving how much yield (e.g., grain, biomass) is produced per unit of water. To produce more crop with less water (more crop per drop) over large scales, a better understanding of measuring, modeling, and mapping CWP of major world crops utilizing multi-sensor remote sensing, meteorological data, crop yield statistics, and cloud based machine learning is needed. &amp;amp;#160;This study aims to establish a novel methodology to measure evapotranspiration and CWP of select crops at 30m resolution. To accomplish this, a benchmark study area within the San Joaquin section of the Central Valley of California, USA was chosen to represent a diverse agricultural growing region. Within this area, leading and high-water consuming world crops were selected and mapped with respective growing seasons determined by NDVI analysis. Actual evapotranspiration (Et&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;a&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt;) as a proxy for water use was determined with new methods to map Evaporative Fraction (Et&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;f&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt;) and Reference Evapotranspiration (Et&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;o&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt;) per crop type.

This study also provides the quantum of water that can be saved if CWP is raised by 10, 20, and 30% relative to existing water use, thus establishing a pathway to create potential water banks from the saved water. Although this study focused on California, the application of methods used has potential to expand globally.

rayyan-224200506,"Combining nutrient competition, dynamic vegetation, and parameter calibration to improve boreal forest predictions to changing climate",,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;While climate change is impacting all parts of the globe, boreal forests are experiencing disproportionally higher rates of temperature increase, thus drastically impacting one of the largest biomes in the world. Changes in high-latitude forests have strong implications to the regional water and carbon cycling, and shifts in canopy cover (i.e., abundance and shifts between evergreen and deciduous species) will alter albedo, ecosystem productivity, and surface and canopy water fluxes. For example, high latitude warming may increase nutrient availability via a deepening of the soil active layer. Warming also induces permafrost degradation and loss, leading to strong interactions that alter the hydrology, and soil biological and physical processes. These climate-related interactions will affect plant competitive interactions, survival, and ultimately community distribution and carbon storage. In this study we explore how vegetation dynamics will be affected by changes in plant and microbial N competition, differences in nutrient demand due to shifts in PFTs (e.g., faster resource acquisition in deciduous plants), and ultimately carbon allocation. To be able to accurately predict and model these complex ecological processes we are using a new demographic vegetation model (FATES; Functionally-Assembled Terrestrial Ecosystem Simulator) that is coupled to ELMv1, the land surface model in the global Earth System Model - E3SM. We present here the newly implemented representation of nutrient competition, acquisition, and extensible approach of nutrient and carbon allocation within plants in the ELM-FATES model. This work has successfully coupled the interactions of nutrients between soil biogeochemistry (BGC) in ELM and plant productivity and carbon in FATES, with improved model hypothesis testing for plant&amp;amp;#8217;s nutrient storage capacity. With the inclusion of nutrient cycling in the previously &amp;amp;#8216;carbon-only&amp;amp;#8217; ELM-FATES where the largest competition was light driven, the productivity and biomass storage was significantly reduced for the simulated boreal forests. After conducting an uncertainty quantification experiment (i.e., using large ensembles to generate surrogate models) in order to test the model parameter sensitivity, we found that model parameters related to carbon storage and leaf economics had the largest sensitivity on plant processes. We then applied a Bayesian inference approach using neural networks to calibrate the model parameters against observational datasets, and greatly improved model predicts to match field inventory data. &amp;amp;#160;These newly represented ecological-based processes have helped to improve the representation of these vulnerable forests in an Earth System Model.&amp;amp;#160;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu22-10649,"",,

The conservation of the salt pans is largely based on the interplay with the water balance of the area and the influence of physical as well as anthropogenic factors. The large number of lakes, which are often only filled with water for a short time due to their shallow depth, makes monitoring by means of installed gauges more difficult. Remote sensing, on the other hand,&amp;amp;#160; is an important source of consistent&amp;amp;#160; information in space and time. In the &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;FEMOWinkel &amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;project, which is funded within the framework of the Austrian &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;StartClim&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; 2021 program, long time series of multispectral satellite data are exploited for monitoring and data-driven modeling of water extent in the salt pans.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The water bodies are delineated based on image time series of the Landsat satellites, which have been providing data almost continuously since the 1980s. Cloud gaps will partly be filled with radar-based information provided by European Copernicus &amp;amp;#8211; Programme. The derived time series of water body extent and number are validated by comparison with aerial photographs and &amp;amp;#8211; where available &amp;amp;#8211; water levels. The salt pans are characterized with respect to their seasonal variability and their reaction to longer-term changes in water availability by comparison with ancillary data, e.g., surface and groundwater levels, climate data and other remote sensing products, such as soil moisture and vegetation indices. In the third step, a data-driven modeling of the lake extent is carried out using machine learning methods. We will also address the question of whether it is possible to predict the effects of dry or wet winters and springs on water body extent in the following summer using these methods.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Preliminary results of the time series analysis show a pronounced dynamic in the extent of the water bodies over the course of the study time. Periods, e.g., from 1990 to 1993 and 2001 to 2007, in which some of the lakes fell dry, alternated with wetter periods, e.g., from 1994 to 1999, in which the salt pans remained at least partially filled even in summer. These differences correlate with drought indicators such as the Standardised Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI). The remote sensing-based approach will make it possible to transfer the applied methods to other similar ecosystems located in steppe regions.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu22-11157,"",,

While a further increase in spatial resolution is computationally expensive and introduces new challenges in the design of these models (e.g. gray-zone parameterizations), statistical downscaling models can overcome the mentioned issues. Inspired by the success of super-resolution applications in computer vision, deep neural networks have recently been recognized as an appealing approach for statistical downscaling of meteorological fields.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In this study, we apply a generative adversarial network (GAN) to downscale the 2m temperature over Central Europe where complex terrain introduces a high degree of spatial variability. GANs are considered superior to purely convolutional networks since the model is encouraged to generate data whose statistical properties are similar to real data. Here, the generator consists of an u-shaped encoder-decoder network which is capable of extracting features on various spatial scales. Instead of pursuing a pure super-resolution approach where coarsened data is mapped back to high resolution data, we choose a more realistic, but also more challenging test suite. Coarsened ERA5 reanalysis data, originally provided on a 0.3&amp;amp;#176;-grid, is used to downscale the 2m temperature onto a 0.1&amp;amp;#176;-grid with the help of short-range forecasts from the operational Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) model. Thus, our GAN model does not only have to reconstruct finer spatial features, but must also correct for model biases.&amp;amp;#160; &amp;lt;br&amp;gt;The downscaled 2m temperature is evaluated in terms of several evaluation metrics measuring the error on grid point-level as well as the quality in terms of spatial variability and the produced probability function. We also investigate the importance of static and dynamic predictors such as the surface elevation and the temperature on different pressure levels, respectively. Our results motivate further development of deep neural networks for statistical downscaling of meteorological fields. This includes downscaling of other, inherently uncertain variables such as precipitation, operations on spatial resolutions at kilometer-scale and ultimately targets an operational application on output data from global NWP models.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;","",https://doi.org/10.5194/ems2022-552,"",,
rayyan-224200585,A benchmark for probabilistic seasonal streamflow forecasting over North America,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Seasonal streamflow forecasts represent critical operational inputs for water sectors and society, for instance for spring flood early warning, water supply, hydropower generation, and irrigation scheduling. Initial hydrological conditions (e.g., snow cover and soil moisture) are an important driver of hydrological predictions on these timescales. In high-latitude and/or high-altitude basins across North America, and the basins downstream of these headwaters, snow is one of the main sources of runoff generation. As a result, data-driven forecasting from snow observations is a well-established approach for operational seasonal streamflow forecasting in the USA (Fleming et al., 2021) and Canada (Zahmatkesh et al., 2019).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As part of the Global Water Futures programme (GWF), we are advancing capabilities for probabilistic streamflow forecasting over North America. The first aim of this work is to benchmark probabilistic seasonal streamflow predictability across the continent. To this end, a data-driven probabilistic seasonal streamflow hindcasting system is being developed and implemented for basins with a nival regime across North America. It uses snow water equivalent measurements from the recent update of the Canadian historical Snow Water Equivalent dataset (CanSWE, 1928&amp;amp;#8211;2020; Vionnet et al., 2021) and the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) manual snow surveys and the SNOTEL automatic snow pillow in the USA. These datasets are gap filled using quantile mapping based on neighbouring snow and precipitation stations (SCDNA dataset; Tang et al., 2020), and subsequently transformed into principal components. These principal components are then used as predictors into a regression model, to generate ensemble hindcasts of streamflow volumes for basins across North America. Preliminary results indicate that this approach is skilful (i.e., better than streamflow climatology) for basins across the Canadian Rockies during the snowmelt season.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;References&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fleming, S.

rayyan-224200589,Deep learning approaches to study floods through river cameras,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The monitoring of river water-levels is essential to study floods and mitigate their risks. However, it is difficult to obtain accurate measurements of river water-levels: indeed, the river gauges commonly used to measure these levels can be overwhelmed during flood events, and their number is declining globally [1,2]. This means that the monitoring and study of floods relying on gauge station measurements can only be based on sparse and possibly inaccurate river water-level data distributed unevenly along the rivers, sometimes several kilometres away from the location of interest.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We investigate if deep learning can be used to monitor river water-levels in a more flexible and efficient way. More specifically, we apply two deep learning approaches on river cameras, which are CCTV cameras commonly used to monitor the surroundings of rivers and could be easily installed at new locations. The first approach [3,4] relies on transfer learning to train water segmentation networks able to find the water pixels within the camera images and use the number of water pixels within (regions of) the images to monitor the relative evolution of the river water-level. The second approach is based on the creation of a large dataset of 32,715 images annotated with distant gauge water-level data in order to accurately train networks able to produce river water-level indexes independent from the field of view of the cameras.&amp;amp;#160;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We show that both approaches can be used as sources of river water-level data. The first approach is able to produce river water-level indexes highly correlated with ground truth river water-levels (Pearson correlation coefficient &amp;gt;0.94). While the second approach is less accurate (Pearson correlation coefficients between 0.8 and 0.94), it is able to produce calibrated indexes independent from the field of view of the camera.&amp;amp;#160;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#160;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;[1] Mishra, A.

rayyan-224200614,Assessment of the impact of climate change on groundwater resources using regional climate model projections: comparison of surrogate modeling techniques,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This work compares two different surrogate data-driven models in order to evaluate the effects of climate change on groundwater resources by means of an ensemble of 13 Regional Climate Models (RCM), provided within the Euro-Cordex project, under two different scenarios (RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5). The impact was evaluated for three future periods: 2006-2035 (short term), 2036-2065 (medium term) and 2066-2095 (long term). Both approaches are based on historical data collected in northern Tuscany, covering the period 2005-2020. Historical precipitation and temperature records, observed in 18 gauging stations, and piezometric levels for 14 wells were used to build the surrogate models. The first methodology is based on a linear regression model and adopted standardized indices: the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) and the Standardized Groundwater Index (SGI). First, for each well, the correlations between SPEIs and SGIs were investigated for the period 2005-2020. In case of meaningful correlation, linear regression equations are used to estimate SGIs as function of SPEIs. The linear regression models were then applied to predict future SGIs &amp;amp;#8203;&amp;amp;#8203;using SPEIs computed from the data &amp;amp;#8203;&amp;amp;#8203;provided by the RCMs projections. The second surrogate technique involves the use of a Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) neural network. LSTM allows to work directly with climate variables and normalized groundwater levels. The LSTM network was trained using the historical precipitation and temperature time series for the period 2005-2018 as input and the normalized groundwater levels as output. Rain, temperature and piezometric level data from 2019 to 2020 were used to test the network. Subsequently, the rainfall and temperature time series &amp;amp;#8203;&amp;amp;#8203;provided by the RCMs have been used by the LSTM to predict the future groundwater levels. The analysis highlights, for both approaches, a negative impact of climate change on the groundwater system. In particular, according to the RCP 4.5 in the medium-term period a larger reduction of groundwater availability is expected, while with the RCP 8.5 the long-term period is the most affected by a groundwater level decline.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu22-12836,"",,

Flowing through Guinea, Mali, Senegal and Mauritania, the Senegal River (fig 1) is a strategic water resource for the West-Africa region and riparian countries development. The Senegal River's water management in time and space is possible thanks to the existing and planned hydroelectric dams built along the river. These water developments aim to meet the growing water, food and energy needs of the member states (Senegal, Mali, Guinea, Mauritania). Access to energy and food security will be a significant challenge in the future due to population growth and climate change. In the coming decades, climate change and changes in land use and land cover will further increase the constraints on the already scarce water resources in the Sudano-Sahelian zone of West Africa.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This study is part of the Nexus &amp;quot;Climate change, LULC change, Water, Energy&amp;quot; in the Senegal River basin. The objective is to assess the impact of climate change and land use/land cover on water resources in the upper Senegal River basin and associated socio-economic activities (energy, agriculture, flood support, flood control) for the time horizon 2050. This study aims to develop simulations of streamflow and water storage under assumptions of LULC and climate change for integrated management of dams in a multiple-use context.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Our methodology is based on A multi-model approach including a climate model, a land use/land cover forecasting model (land change modeler) for modelling and elaborating future land use/land cover maps (2050) based on past trends (1986, 2006 and 2020) of LULC map, a hydrological model (Swim) for modelling runoff and projecting flows to 2050, and a reservoir management model (Simulsen) for simulating dam management.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In this presentation or poster, we will present the elaboration of future LULC maps based on past

rayyan-224200778,Large‐Scale Groundwater Monitoring in Brazil Assisted With Satellite‐Based Artificial Intelligence Techniques,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract Here, we develop and test an artificial intelligence (AI)‐based approach to monitor major Brazilian aquifers. The approach combines Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) data and ground‐based hydrogeological measurements from Brazil's Integrated Groundwater Monitoring Network at hundreds of wells distributed in 12 aquifers across the country. We tested model ensembles based on three AI approaches: Extreme Gradient Boost, Light Gradient Boosting Model and CatBoost, followed by a Linear Regression step. The approach is further boosted with wavelet and seasonal decomposition processes applied to GRACE data. To determine the AI‐based model's sensitivity to data availability, we propose four experiments combining hydrogeological measurements from different aquifers. Groundwater storage (GWS) estimates from the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) are used as benchmark. A sensitivity analysis shows that the LR‐based model ensemble is the best suited and to reproduce GWS change in all studied Brazilian aquifers. Results show that the proposed approach outperforms GLDAS in all experiments, with an root mean square error (RMSE) value of 2.68 cm for the experiment that covers all monitored wells in Brazil. GLDAS resulted in RMSE = 6.76 cm. Using our AI model outputs, we quantified the GWS change of two major aquifers, Urucuia and Bauru‐Caiuá, over the past two decades: −31 and −6 km 3 , respectively. Water loss is driven by a prolonged drought across most of the country and intensification of groundwater pumping for irrigation. This study demonstrates that combining satellite data and AI can be a cost‐effective alternative to monitor poorly equipped aquifers at the continental scale, with possible global replicability.","",https://doi.org/10.1029/2022wr033588,"",,
rayyan-224200785,Artificial Intelligence for Sustainable Water Management and Treatment,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Surface water and groundwater levels are steadily declining; therefore, the usage of available or recycled water in agriculture should be efficient and sustainable. It should also be noted that agricultural income is considered as a key factor in controlling a country's economy and growth. Sensor technologies would unquestionably support farmers in making irrigation decisions to promote agricultural development as well as increase crop production. By implementing cutting-edge agricultural technology in irrigation, the crop's total production cost may be lowered, and time can be saved by removing human involvement. It is expected to be expanded up in the near future by integrating wireless sensor networks within agricultural regions. As a result, the current chapter aims to provide information on the most recent technologies used in agricultural systems, specifically the various types of irrigation techniques, the driving forces behind the search for innovative irrigation techniques, and the artificial intelligence sensors that are commonly used for water preservation and conservation. Furthermore, agriculture water management through multi-Intelligent control system is highlighted.","",https://doi.org/10.1201/9781003260455-3,"",,

Global issues including water scarcity and environmental concerns now require creative and sustainable approaches to managing water resources. This chapter will examine how the internet of things (IoT) and cutting-edge technologies like machine learning (ML) are revolutionizing the way that water management is done. In this chapter, the effective uses of machine learning in water resource analysis will be examined. Forecasting water demand requires the use of ML algorithms, which help water managers predict consumption trends with accuracy. Predictive analytics can also be used to evaluate the distribution and availability of water, providing information on how to allocate and optimize water resources. The chapter concluded with revolutionary potential of machine learning and the internet of things in modernizing water management practices globally.","",https://doi.org/10.4018/979-8-3693-1194-3.ch002,"",,

With the growing awareness of the need for water conservation, the world is gearing to accommodate and implement latest technology for the optimum utilisation of the drying up reservoirs. This paper aims at developing a cost effective, portable and ready to plug mechanism labelled as “Innovative Smart Water Management System Using Artificial Intelligence” which shall monitor the proportion of water usage per household and keep a tracking on metric usage on the water usage on a weekly, monthly or a yearly basis. The data generated will be established and collected in the Firebase server. Based on the collected data, it shall also make predictions on the usage and hence allocate resources in a controlled fashion as per requirement. Later the data will be modelled in Time Series fashion to generate real time prediction of water consumption for the household respectively. The water consumer can track the usage by a custom-made android application on MIT App Inventor. Extensive, detailed instructions have been provided on the initial setup procedure and installation. The water monitoring module is used on a daily basis and a tab is kept on the amount of water spilled. This will keep a check on the casual approach of people towards water. It will also encourage a more systematic method to handle water resources and hence would result in better conservation efforts","",https://doi.org/10.17762/turcomat.v12i3.1895,"",,
rayyan-224200901,Assessment of sustainability index for rural water management using ANN,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract The current study proposes a sustainability index (SI) measure based on artificial neural networks (ANN) and globally accepted parameters. Some of the available methods for SI measurement are multi-criteria analysis, external costs, energy analysis, and ecological footprint methods. However, validity remains a concern due to a system's needs, criteria, and requirements. Generally, sustainability is assessed in economic, environmental, and social issues, which varies across regions and countries. Most of the studies accept sub-indices but to a limited extent. Therefore, the proposed study develops an SI evaluation method based on the idea of multi-sustainability incorporating operations, institutions, risks, and climate factors besides economic, environmental, and social issues. All these issues might not be applicable to a single project but may help to develop a complete index when applied. The present study considered different scenarios in building a method to calculate SI using ANN. The results obtained by the ANN model for various input parameters helped to identify the best water conservation strategy. Sensitivity analysis was also performed to determine the uncertainty contribution/significance of the input variables for the water scarcity in the study region.

In this study, we explored the use of statistical machine learning and long-term groundwater nitrate monitoring data to estimate vadose zone and saturated zone lag times in an irrigated alluvial agricultural setting. Unlike most previous statistical machine learning studies that sought to predict groundwater nitrate concentrations within aquifers, the focus of this study was to leverage available groundwater nitrate concentrations and other environmental variables to determine mean regional vertical velocities (transport rates) of water and solutes in the vadose zone and saturated zone (3.50 and 3.75 m yr−1, respectively). The statistical machine learning results are consistent with two primary recharge processes in this western Nebraska aquifer, namely (1) diffuse recharge from irrigation and precipitation across the landscape and (2) focused recharge from leaking irrigation conveyance canals. The vadose zone mean velocity yielded a mean recharge rate (0.46 m yr−1) consistent with previous estimates from groundwater age dating in shallow wells (0.38 m yr−1). The saturated zone mean velocity yielded a recharge rate (1.31 m yr−1) that was more consistent with focused recharge from leaky irrigation canals, as indicated by previous results of groundwater age dating in intermediate-depth wells (1.22 m yr−1). Collectively, the statistical machine learning model results are consistent with previous observations of relatively high water fluxes and short transit times for water and nitrate in the primarily oxic aquifer. Partial dependence plots from the model indicate a sharp threshold in which high groundwater nitrate concentrations are mostly associated with total travel times of 7 years or less, possibly reflecting some combination of recent management practices and a tendency for nitrate concentrations to be higher in diffuse infiltration recharge than in canal leakage water. Limitations to the machine learning approach include the non-uniqueness of different transport rate combinations when comparing model performance and highlight the need to corroborate statistical model results with a robust conceptual model and complementary information such as groundwater age.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-25-811-2021,"",,

In this study, remote sensing-based data were used to develop two deep learning predictive models, long short term memory (LSTM), and convolutional neural network-LSTM (CNN-LSTM) models. The input variables were terrestrial water storage anomaly (TWSA) recorded by the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellites and the GRACE-Follow-On (GRACE-FO) mission, precipitation measured by the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite, average temperature and soil moisture obtained from the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS), and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI) acquired from the Landsat 5 and 8 satellites. A comparison of groundwater storage change predictions by the two deep learning predictive models with in situ measurements of the National Groundwater Monitoring Network (NGMN) in South Korea showed that the CNN-LSTM model was more accurate [root mean square error (RMSE) = 44.92 mm/month, correlation coefficient (r) = 0.70, index of agreement (IOA) = 0.81] than the LSTM model [RMSE = 47.44 mm/month, r = 0.62, and IOA = 0.77]. Furthermore, a comparison of the performance of the two models for three specific regions showed that the CNN-LSTM model captured spatiotemporal variations in groundwater storage better. Additionally, a comparison of cumulative change trends in groundwater storage with the NDVI, MNDWI, and TWSA data showed that changes in land cover and total water storage affect groundwater storage. These comparison results demonstrate that the use of parameters recorded by multiple satellites as training data for deep learning models can play an important role in the model's performance.","",https://doi.org/10.1109/access.2021.3130306,"",,
rayyan-224201107,Modelling of total dissolved solids in water supply systems using regression and supervised machine learning approaches,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract Monitoring of water quality through accurate predictions provides adequate information about water management. In the present study, three different modelling approaches: Gaussian process regression (GPR), backpropagation neural network (BPNN) and principal component regression (PCR) models were used to predict the total dissolved solids (TDS) as water quality indicator for the water quality management. The performance of each model was evaluated based on three different sets of inputs from groundwater (GW), surface water (SW) and drinking water (DW). The GPR, BPNN and PCR models used in this study gave an accurate prediction of the observed data (TDS) in GW, SW and DW, with the R 2 consistently greater than 0.850. The GPR model gave a better prediction of TDS concentration, with an average R 2 , MAE and RMSE of 0.987, 4.090 and 7.910, respectively. For the BPNN, an average R 2 , MAE and RMSE of 0.913, 9.720 and 19.137, respectively, were achieved, while the PCR gave an average R 2 , MAE and RMSE of 0.888, 11.327 and 25.032, respectively. The performance of each model was assessed using efficiency based indicators such as the Nash and Sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency ( E NS ) and the index of agreement (d). The GPR, BPNN and PCR models, respectively, gave an E NS of (0.967, 0.915, 0.874) and d of (0.992, 0.977, 0.965). It is understood from this study that advanced machine learning approaches (e.g. GPR and BPNN) are appropriate for the prediction of water quality indices and would be useful for future prediction and management of water quality parameters of various water supply systems in mining communities where artificial intelligence technology is yet to be fully explored.","",https://doi.org/10.1007/s13201-020-01352-7,"",,

Aquatic pollution, destruction of fish habitats, water abstraction and impacts on aquatic biodiversity are all increasing. Industrial aquaculture has resulted in a far-reaching variety of environments that threatens native wild fish populations. The spread of deadly diseases and parasites is another challenge of aquaculture. These challenges can be overcome by applying proper water quality monitoring. This research suggests potential improvements after analyzing earlier studies regarding water quality prediction. In this research, previous works on water quality prediction have analyzed and proposed a novel smart aquaculture system using machine intelligence (SAS-MI) model. The novel SAS-MI model uses the deep convolutional neural network (D-CNN) and k-means clustering technique. The k-means clustering used in the SAS-MI clusters the unlabeled dataset used for training and testing. The D-CNN predicts the quality of the water for smart aquaculture by automatic feature engineering by the neurons. The proposed model performance was evaluated using the comparative study performed over the existing prediction models such as logistic regression, decision trees, XG boost classifiers, k-Nearest Neighbors, and SVM.

However, most of the existing studies used physical models, which are not accurate enough due to our limited ability to represent the ET process accurately or rarely focused on cropland. In this study, we trained two models of estimating croplands ET. The first is Medlyn-Penman-Monteith (Medlyn-PM) model. It uses artificial neural network (ANN)-derived gross primary production along with Medlyn’s stomatal conductance to compute surface conductance (Gs), and the computed Gs is used to estimate ET using the PM equation. The second model, termed ANN-PM, directly uses ANN to construct Gs and simulate ET using the PM equation. The results showed that the two models can reasonably reproduce ET with ANN-PM showing a better performance, as indicated by the lower error and higher determination coefficients. The results also showed that the performances of ANN-PM without the facilitation of any remote sensing (RS) factors degraded significantly compared to the versions that used RS factors. We also evidenced that ANN-PM can reasonably characterize the time-series changes of ET at sites having a dry climate. The ANN-PM method can reasonably estimate the ET of croplands under different environmental conditions.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/app11188649,"",,

However, few studies have been conducted in semi-arid Africa, even less in Madagascar. Here we report, climate-induced future hydrological prediction in Mangoky river, Madagascar using an artificial neural network (ANN) and the soil and water assessment tool (SWAT). The current study downscaled two global climate models on the mid-term, noted the 2040s (2041–2050) and long-term, noted 2090s (2091–2099) under two shared socioeconomic pathways (SSP) scenarios, SSP 3–7.0 and SSP 5–8.5. Statistical indices of both ANN and SWAT showed good performance (R2 &gt; 0.65) of the models. Our results revealed a rise in maximum temperature (4.26–4.69 °C) and minimum temperature (2.74–3.01 °C) in the 2040s and 2090s. Under SSP 3–7.0 and SSP 5–8.5, a decline in the annual precipitation is projected in the 2040s and increased the 2090s. This study found that future precipitation and temperature could significantly decrease annual runoff by 60.59% and 73.77% in the 2040s; and 25.18% and 23.45% in the 2090s under SSP 3–7.0 and SSP 5–8.5, respectively.

The increase in deforestation has been threatening water availability in this region. In order to assist in the water-resource management of the BCB, this study models the daily streamflow in a basin of the Cerrado, using two approaches: a process-based model (Soil and Water Assessment Tool - SWAT) and the data-driven model (Artificial Neural Network - ANN). The performance of the models was evaluated by the Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient (NSE), coefficient of determination (R2) and flow-duration-curves (FDC). The results indicate that SWAT (NSE &gt; 0.61; R2 &gt; 0.68) and ANN (NSE &gt; 0.91; R2 &gt; 0.79) models are suitable tools in daily streamflow modeling of the studied basin, with the ANN model being the most accurate. Based on FDC, the ANN model was also better than the SWAT model for all frequencies evaluated. Thus, the ANN model is a promising new approach for daily streamflow modelling in this region. Moreover, the results of this study can help water-resource managers in planning and implementing appropriate water allocation and conservation measures in the Brazilian Cerrado biome.","",https://doi.org/10.4136/ambi-agua.2639,"",,
rayyan-224201160,Using Long Short-Term Memory networks to connect water table depth anomalies to precipitation anomalies over Europe,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract. Many European countries rely on groundwater for public and industrial water supply. Due to a scarcity of near-real-time water table depth (wtd) observations, establishing a spatially consistent groundwater monitoring system at the continental scale is a challenge. Hence, it is necessary to develop alternative methods for estimating wtd anomalies (wtda) using other hydrometeorological observations routinely available near real time. In this work, we explore the potential of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for producing monthly wtda using monthly precipitation anomalies (pra) as input. LSTM networks are a special category of artificial neural networks that are useful for detecting a long-term dependency within sequences, in our case time series, which is expected in the relationship between pra and wtda. In the proposed methodology, spatiotemporally continuous data were obtained from daily terrestrial simulations of the Terrestrial Systems Modeling Platform (TSMP) over Europe (hereafter termed the TSMP-G2A data set), with a spatial resolution of 0.11∘, ranging from the years 1996 to 2016. The data were separated into a training set (1996–2012), a validation set (2013–2014), and a test set (2015–2016) to establish local networks at selected pixels across Europe. The modeled wtda maps from LSTM networks agreed well with TSMP-G2A wtda maps on spatially distributed dry and wet events, with 2003 and 2015 constituting drought years over Europe. Moreover, we categorized the test performances of the networks based on intervals of yearly averaged wtd, evapotranspiration (ET), soil moisture (θ), snow water equivalent (Sw), soil type (St), and dominant plant functional type (PFT). Superior test performance was found at the pixels with wtd &lt; 3 m, ET &gt; 200 mm, θ&gt;0.15 m3 m−3, and Sw&lt;10 mm, revealing a significant impact of the local factors on the ability of the networks to process information. Furthermore, results of the cross-wavelet transform (XWT) showed a change in the temporal pattern between TSMP-G2A pra and wtda at some selected pixels, which can be a reason for undesired network behavior. Our results demonstrate that LSTM networks are useful for producing high-quality wtda based on other hydrometeorological data measured and predicted at large scales, such as pra. This contribution may facilitate the establishment of an effective groundwater monitoring system over Europe that is relevant to water management.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-25-3555-2021,"",,
rayyan-224201175,Lightweight Deep Neural Network Method for Water Body Extraction from High-Resolution Remote Sensing Images with Multisensors,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Rapid and accurate extraction of water bodies from high-spatial-resolution remote sensing images is of great value for water resource management, water quality monitoring and natural disaster emergency response. For traditional water body extraction methods, it is difficult to select image texture and features, the shadows of buildings and other ground objects are in the same spectrum as water bodies, the existing deep convolutional neural network is difficult to train, the consumption of computing resources is large, and the methods cannot meet real-time requirements. In this paper, a water body extraction method based on lightweight MobileNetV2 is proposed and applied to multisensor high-resolution remote sensing images, such as GF-2, WorldView-2 and UAV orthoimages. This method was validated in two typical complex geographical scenes: water bodies for farmland irrigation, which have a broken shape and long and narrow area and are surrounded by many buildings in towns and villages; and water bodies in mountainous areas, which have undulating topography, vegetation coverage and mountain shadows all over. The results were compared with those of the support vector machine, random forest and U-Net models and also verified by generalization tests and the influence of spatial resolution changes. First, the results show that the F1-score and Kappa coefficients of the MobileNetV2 model extracting water bodies from three different high-resolution images were 0.75 and 0.72 for GF-2, 0.86 and 0.85 for Worldview-2 and 0.98 and 0.98 for UAV, respectively, which are higher than those of traditional machine learning models and U-Net. Second, the training time, number of parameters and calculation amount of the MobileNetV2 model were much lower than those of the U-Net model, which greatly improves the water body extraction efficiency. Third, in other more complex surface areas, the MobileNetV2 model still maintained relatively high accuracy of water body extraction. Finally, we tested the effects of multisensor models and found that training with lower and higher spatial resolution images combined can be beneficial, but that using just lower resolution imagery is ineffective. This study provides a reference for the efficient automation of water body classification and extraction under complex geographical environment conditions and can be extended to water resource investigation, management and planning.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/s21217397,"",,

Studies on the reliability of these hydropower plants due to climate and land-use/land cover changes on the hydrology of these rivers are scanty. Therefore, this study aimed to model the impact of the changing climate and land-use/cover on hydropower reliability to aid proper planning and management. The hydropower reliability of Muzizi River catchment was determined from its past (1998–2010) and midcentury (2041–2060) discharge at 30 and 95% exceedance probability under Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) of 4.5 and 8.5, respectively. The past and projected hydropower were compared to determine how future climate and land-use changes will impact the discharge and hydropower reliability of Muzizi River catchment. Six LULC scenarios (deforestation, 31–20%; grassland, 19–3%; cropland, 50–77%; water bodies, 0.02–0.01%; settlement, 0.23–0.37%, and Barren land 0.055–0.046% between 2014 and 2060) and three downscaled Regional Climate Model (REMO and RCA4 for precipitation and RACMO22T for temperature from a pool of four CORDEX (Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment) Africa RCMs) were examined. A calibrated SWAT simulation model was applied for the midcentury (2041–2060) period, and a potential change in hydropower energy in reference to mean daily flow (designflow ≥ 30% exceedance probability), firm flow (flow ≥ 95% exceedance probability), and mean annual flow was evaluated under the condition of altered runoff under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 climate change scenarios for an average of REMO and RCA4 RCM. The future land use (2060) was projected using the MOLUSCE (Module for Land Use Change Evaluation) plugin in QGIS using CA-ANN. Three scenarios have been described in this study, including LULC change, climate change, and combined (climate and LULC change). The results suggest that there will be a significant increase in annual hydropower generation capacity (from 386.27 and 488.1 GWh to 867.82 and 862.53 GWh under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, respectively) for the combined future effect of climate and land-use/cover changes.

At the same time, rapid advancements have also been taking place in tracing, mapping, remote sensing, machine learning, and modelling technologies in hydrological research. Despite those programs and advancements, a water crisis is intensifying globally. The missing link is effective interactions between the hydrological research and water resource management to support implementation of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) at multiple spatial scales. Since the watershed is the natural unit for water resources management, watershed science offers the potential to bridge this missing link. This study first reviews the advances in hydrological research and water resources management, and then discusses issues and challenges facing the global water community. Subsequently, it describes the core components of watershed science: (1) hydrological analysis; (2) water-operation policies; (3) governance; (4) management and feedback. The framework takes into account water availability, water uses, and water quality; explicitly focuses on the storage, fluxes, and quality of the hydrological cycle; defines appropriate local water resource thresholds through incorporating the planetary boundary framework; and identifies specific actionable measures for water resources management. It provides a complementary approach to the existing water management programs in addressing the current global water crisis and achieving the UN SDGs.","",https://doi.org/10.1007/s11430-020-9723-4,"",,

We conducted a systematic review of predictive models of fecal indicator bacteria at freshwater recreational sites in temperate climates to identify and describe the existing approaches, trends, and their performance to inform beach water management policies.

The interrelationships among water quality parameters and the relationships between these parameters and taxa groups are complicated in affecting biodiversity. Nevertheless, due to the limited types of Internet-of-Things (IoT) sensors available on the market, a large number of chemical and biological parameters still rely on laboratory tests. With the latest advancement in Artificial intelligence and the IoT (AIoT), this technique can be applied to real-time monitoring of water quality, and further conserving biodiversity. In this article, we conducted a comprehensive literature review on water quality parameters that impact the biodiversity of freshwater and identified the top-10 crucial water quality parameters.

In total, the current daily operation of the short-term low-volume (STLV) seawater desalination plants produces 36,000 m3 and, on the large-scale perspective, the seawater desalination capacity is planned to increase from 150,000 to 300,000 m3 per day by the years 2025 and 2035, respectively. The wastewater treatment and reuse activities are processed through three wastewater treatment plants with a total daily capacity of 130,000 m3 which is proposed to be increased to a capacity of 235,000 m3 by the beginning of 2025. Stormwater collecting and harvesting supply the water sector by about 550–820 cubic meters per day. The proposed stochastic and artificial intelligence model that was developed in this study to simulate the interactive conditions between the groundwater and the water intervention plan showed proper performance in terms of (r) = 0.95–0.99 and the root mean square error (RMSE) = 0.09–0.21. The model outputs reveal that the annual groundwater abstractions will reach 192 million cubic meters by 2040 with an annual increasing rate of +3%. By applying the model, the optimum utilization of the unconventional water resources contributes positively to the recovery of the GCA, which is experiencing a decline hot spot in the water level that reaches to −19 m below mean sea level (MSL) and is expected to drop to −28 m MSL by 2040. The impact of unconventional water resources interventions was investigated by simulating the water table trend using stochastic models and artificial neural networks (ANNs) through three scenarios. The first scenario, which addresses the non-intervention status, indicates that the groundwater table will decline by −1.5% in the northern governorates and by −51% in the southern governorates of the Gaza Strip within 2020–2040. The second scenario demonstrates the impact of the existing water interventions that revealed an interim recovery in the groundwater balance until 2025 in which the water consumption tended to increase rapidly. The third scenario illustrates the impact of applying the full water management intervention plan in which the depression cone in the groundwater level will be restored by about +10 m.","",https://doi.org/10.2166/ws.2021.170,"",,

The ANFIS model is designed to forecast river water levels at the downstream area in hourly lead times. River water level, rainfall, and river flows were considered as input variables located in upstream stations, and one river water level in the downstream station is chosen as flood forecasting point (FFP) target. Particularly, each of these input-output configurations consists of four stations located in different areas. About twenty-seven data with fifteen minutes basis recorded in January 2013 to March 2015 were used in training and testing the ANFIS network.

The monthly weighted observed rainfall exhibited relatively comparable results with SREs, except for the annual peak rainfall shifts noted in all SREs. The PERSIANN-CDR products showed a decreasing trend in rainfall at elevations greater than 2250 m above sea level in a river basin. This demonstrates that elevation and rainfall regimes may affect satellite rainfall data. On the basis of modified Kling–Gupta Efficiency, the SREs from IMERG v06, TRMM 3B43v7, and PERSIANN-CDR performed well in descending order over the ARB. However, GSMaP showed poor performance except in the upland sub-basin. A high frequency of bias, which led to an overestimation of SREs, was exhibited in TRMM 3B43v7 and PERSIANN-CDR products in the eastern and lower basins. Furthermore, the MK test results of SREs showed that none of the sub-basins exhibited a monotonic trend at 5% significance level except the GSMap rainfall in the upland sub-basin. In ARB, except for the GSMaP, all SREs can be used as alternative options for rainfall frequency-, flood-, and drought-monitoring studies. However, some may require bias corrections to improve the data quality.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/rs13071275,"",,
rayyan-224201346,On application of artificial neural networks for modeling of water consumption.,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"The article shows the capabilities of artificial neural networks built on radial basis functions for the study of water consumption by various branches of the Don River basin water system. The use of mathematical models in the form of a system of differentiated equations is hampered by the uncertainty of the coefficients in their right-hand sides, which describe the intensities of processes of different natures: precipitation, water consumption by various sectors of the water management complex, water runoff during snow melting, transpiration, infiltration, etc. As a rule, these parameters are random, and the mathematical models describing the water balance are stochastic. The use of neural networks is very fruitful here. Without going into the physical essence of the processes, they can be used to approximate and make reliable predictions, which is a prerequisite for the development of dynamic-stochastic concepts in the management of water resources.","",https://doi.org/10.35567/1999-4508-2021-1-5,"",,
rayyan-224201414,Construction and Application of Recognition Model for Black-Odorous Water Bodies Based on Artificial Neural Network,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"In the water environment, construction, and civil engineering industries, digital twins have gradually become a popular solution in recent years, and in digital twins, accurate data prediction and category recognition are important parts of it. Artificial neural network (ANN), a widely used data‐driven model, can accurately identify nonlinear relationships in the water environment. In this paper, a recognition model for black‐odorous water bodies based on ANN was established to directly identify the sensory description of water bodies. This study used water quality data and sensory description (color and odor) as samples to train backpropagation (BP) neural networks. The training results show that the accuracy of the color and odor models reaches 86.7% and 85.8%, respectively. It can thus be suggested that the sensory description can be accurately recognized by BP neural network. The application results indicate that all seven rivers had black‐odorous phenomenon within a year. The recognition models have been instrumental in water resource management. Meanwhile, the models provide a reference for the evaluation and early warning of black‐odorous water bodies in other regions.","",https://doi.org/10.1155/2021/3918524,"",,
rayyan-224201475,"Upscaling dryland carbon and water fluxes with artificial neural networks of optical, thermal, and microwave satellite remote sensing",,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Earth&amp;#8217;s drylands are home to more than two billion people, provide key ecosystem services, and exert a large influence on the trends and variability in Earth&amp;#8217;s carbon cycle. However, modeling dryland carbon and water fluxes with remote sensing suffers from unique challenges not typically encountered in mesic systems, particularly in capturing soil moisture stress. Here, we develop and evaluate an approach for joint modeling of dryland gross primary production (GPP), net ecosystem exchange (NEE), and evapotranspiration (ET) in the western United States (U.S.) using a suite of AmeriFlux eddy covariance sites spanning major functional types and aridity regimes. We use artificial neural networks (ANNs) to predict dryland ecosystem fluxes by fusing optical vegetation indices, multitemporal thermal observations, and microwave soil moisture/temperature retrievals from the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) sensor. Our new dryland ANN (DrylANNd) carbon and water flux model explains more than 70% of monthly variance in GPP and ET, improving upon existing MODIS GPP and ET estimates at most dryland eddy covariance sites. DrylANNd predictions of NEE were considerably worse than its predictions of GPP and ET, likely because soil and plant respiratory processes are largely invisible to satellite sensors. Optical vegetation indices, particularly the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and near-infrared reflectance of vegetation (NIRv), were generally the most important variables contributing to model skill. However, daytime and nighttime land surface temperatures and SMAP soil moisture and soil temperature also contributed to model skill, with SMAP especially improving model predictions of shrubland, grassland, and savanna fluxes and land surface temperatures improving predictions in evergreen needleleaf forests. Our results show that a combination of optical vegetation indices, thermal infrared, and microwave observations can substantially improve estimates of carbon and water fluxes in drylands, potentially providing the means to better monitor vegetation function and ecosystem services in these important regions that are undergoing rapid hydroclimatic change.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu23-1824,"",,
rayyan-224201513,Towards hybrid modeling of the global hydrological cycle,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract. Progress in machine learning in conjunction with the increasing availability of relevant Earth observation data streams may help to overcome uncertainties of global hydrological models due to the complexity of the processes, diversity, and heterogeneity of the land surface and subsurface, as well as scale-dependency of processes and parameters. In this study, we exemplify a hybrid approach to global hydrological modeling that exploits the data-adaptiveness of machine learning for representing uncertain processes within a model structure based on physical principles like mass conservation. Our H2M model simulates the dynamics of snow, soil moisture, and groundwater pools globally at 1º spatial resolution and daily time step where simulated water fluxes depend on an embedded recurrent neural network. We trained the model simultaneously against observational products of terrestrial water storage variations (TWS), runoff, evapotranspiration, and snow water equivalent with a multi-task learning approach. We find that H2M is capable of reproducing the key patterns of global water cycle components with model performances being at least on par with four state-of-the-art global hydrological models. The neural network learned hydrological responses of evapotranspiration and runoff generation to antecedent soil moisture state that are qualitatively consistent with our understanding and theory. Simulated contributions of groundwater, soil moisture, and snowpack variability to TWS variations are plausible and within the large range of traditional GHMs. H2M indicates a somewhat stronger role of soil moisture for TWS variations in transitional and tropical regions compared to GHMs. Overall, we present a proof of concept for global hybrid hydrological modeling in providing a new, complementary, and data-driven perspective on global water cycle variations. With further increasing Earth observations, hybrid modeling has a large potential to advance our capability to monitor and understand the Earth system by facilitating a data-adaptive yet physically consistent, joint interpretation of heterogeneous data streams.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-2021-211,"",,

Conventionally ET<sub>0</sub> is calculated by various empirical methods based on rigorous climatic data. However, there are many places where various climatic data may not available for ET<sub>0</sub> estimation. The objective of this study is to evaluate different machine learning (ML) techniques to estimate ET<sub>0</sub> with minimal climatic inputs. In this study, FAO-56 Penman-Monteith model was considered as the standard model and different ML models based on A Long short-term memory neural networks (LSTM), Gradient Boosting Regressor (GBR), Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Regression (SVR) were developed to estimate ET<sub>0</sub> with climatic variables as input parameters. These models were evaluated in two different climatic regions, Hyderabad in India and Waipara in New Zealand. The results indicated that 99 % accuracy could be achieved with all climatic input, whereas accuracy drops to 86% with fewer data. LSTM model performed better than other ML models with all input combinations at both the stations, followed by SVR and RF. Both LSTM and SVR models have been noted as the most robust ML models for estimating ET<sub>0</sub> with minimal climate data. Even though the excellent performance can be achievable when all input variables are used, the study, however, found that even a three-parameter combination (Temperature, Wind Speed and Relative Humidity values) or two-parameter combination (Temperature and Relative Humidity, Temperature and Wind Speed) can also be promising in ET<sub>0</sub> estimation. The presented study will help to estimate ET<sub>0</sub> for data scare regions, which is vital for agricultural water management in semi-arid climates. </abstract>","",https://doi.org/10.3934/geosci.2021016,"",,
rayyan-224201527,A Forecasting and Prediction Methodology for Improving the Blue Economy Resilience to Climate Change in the Romanian Lower Danube Euroregion,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"European Union (EU) policy encourages the development of a blue economy (BE) by unlocking the full economic potential of oceans, seas, lakes, rivers and other water resources, especially in member countries in which it represents a low contribution to the national economy (under 1%). However, climate change represents a main barrier to fully realizing a BE. Enabling conditions that will support the sustainable development of a BE and increase its climate resiliency must be promoted. Romania has high potential to contribute to the development of the EU BE due to its geographic characteristics, namely the presence of the Danube Delta-Black Sea macrosystem, which is part of the Romanian Lower Danube Euroregion (RLDE). Aquatic living resources represent a sector which can significantly contribute to the growth of the BE in the RLDE, a situation which imposes restrictions for both halting biodiversity loss and maintaining the proper conditions to maximize the benefits of the existing macrosystem. It is known that climate change causes water quality problems, accentuates water level fluctuations and loss of biodiversity and induces the destruction of habitats, which eventually leads to fish stock depletion. This paper aims to develop an analytical framework based on multiple linear predictive and forecast models that offers cost-efficient tools for the monitoring and control of water quality, fish stock dynamics and biodiversity in order to strengthen the resilience and adaptive capacity of the BE of the RLDE in the context of climate change. The following water-dependent variables were considered: total nitrogen (TN); total phosphorus (TP); dissolved oxygen (DO); pH; water temperature (wt); and water level, all of which were measured based on a series of 26 physicochemical indicators associated with 4 sampling areas within the RLDE (Brăila, Galați, Tulcea and Sulina counties). Predictive models based on fish species catches associated with the Galati County Danube River Basin segment and the “Danube Delta” Biosphere Reserve Administration territory were included in the analytical framework to establish an efficient tool for monitoring fish stock dynamics and structures as well as identify methods of controlling fish biodiversity in the RLDE to enhance the sustainable development and resilience of the already-existing BE and its expansion (blue growth) in the context of aquatic environment climate variation. The study area reflects the integrated approach of the emerging BE, focused on the ocean, seas, lakes and rivers according to the United Nations Agenda. The results emphasized the vulnerability of the RLDE to climate change, a situation revealed by the water level, air temperature and water quality parameter trend lines and forecast models. Considering the sampling design applied within the RLDE, it can be stated that the Tulcea county Danube sector was less affected by climate change compared with the Galați county sector as confirmed by water TN and TP forecast analysis, which revealed higher increasing trends in Galați compared with Tulcea. The fish stock biodiversity was proven to be affected by global warming within the RLDE, since peaceful species had a higher upward trend compared with predatory species. Water level and air temperature forecasting analysis proved to be an important tool for climate change monitoring in the study area. The resulting analytical framework confirmed that time series methods could be used together with machine learning prediction methods to highlight their synergetic abilities for monitoring and predicting the impact of climate change on the marine living resources of the BE sector within the RLDE. The forecasting models developed in the present study were meant to be used as methods of revealing future information, making it possible for decision makers to adopt proper management solutions to prevent or limit the negative impacts of climate change on the BE. Through the identified independent variables, prediction models offer a solution for managing the dependent variables and the possibility of performing less cost-demanding aquatic environment monitoring activities.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/su132111563,"",,
rayyan-224201576,Towards flood warnings everywhere - data-driven rainfall-runoff modeling at global scale,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"The goal of Google&amp;#8217;s Flood Forecasting Initiative is to provide timely and actionable flood warnings to everyone, globally. Until recently, Google provided operational flood warnings only for specific partner countries, namely India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Colombia, and Brazil. In 2021 our flood alerting system sent out around 115 million flood notifications, reaching over 23 million people in the affected local areas. In all of the regions mentioned above, our operational model relies on partnerships with local governments to provide real-time measurements of observed discharge or water level (Nevo et al. 2021). However, relying on real-time measurement data makes it harder to scale to new regions as a) this data does not exist everywhere, and b) even if it exists, it requires significant per-country time and resource investment.Building on research results from the last few years (e.g., Kratzert et al. 2019a, Kratzert et al. 2019b, Klotz et al. 2021), we built a global rainfall-runoff model that does not rely on real-time measurements in the operational context but only uses globally available forcing data and globally available catchment attributes. It can therefore be deployed everywhere, including in ungauged basins. Following Kratzert et al. (2019a), our rainfall-runoff model is based on the Long Short-Term Memory network (LSTM) and is trained on thousands of hydrologically diverse basins from all around the world. To forecast river discharge for any given river on Earth, the model uses time series data from various meteorological forcing products (IMERG, CPC, ERA5-Land, ECMWF&amp;#8217;s IFS), as well as static catchment characteristics.This new model allows us to scale to new regions more quickly. As of January 2023, we now provide operational flood warnings to hundreds of sites across 48 countries worldwide, with hundreds of more sites being rolled out in the coming months. Besides our previous channels of communicating flood warnings (e.g. Google Search, Google Maps, Google Alerts, and direct communications with NGOs and governments), we also released FloodHub (g.co/floodhub), a new interactive portal that allows for easy access to all operational forecasts.Here, we present more information about the modeling methodology shifts, the challenges we faced and finally showcase the latest advancements made.&amp;#160;References:Klotz, D., et al.

rayyan-224201588,Agricultural Technologies,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Provisioning food and nutritional security for India's 1.4 billion population is a challenge and requires robust agricultural research and extension mechanism to address the complex issues. Further, India has only 2.4% and 4% of global land and water availability, respectively with which it should support 17.5% of the world population. From the position of 'begging bowl' for its 330 million population in the 1950s, India not only became food secure for its ~1.4 billion current population but became a net exporter of food grains. While there was a 5.6 times increase in food grain production since independence, there was also a substantial increase in the production of pulses (3 times), oilseed (5 times), cotton (11.4 times), sugarcane (6.6 times), milk (9.7 times), fish (15.2 times), egg (47.5 times), etc. Except for the British period, there was a steady increase in the development of agricultural technology and subsequent production of agricultural and allied enterprises over the centuries. Scientific integration of crops and livestock, along with the concept of manuring and irrigation, has existed since Indus Valley Civilization. After the Independence, there was enormous growth in the agricultural sector and food production due to different pioneer schemes of the Government of India like Grow More Food Campaign and Integrated Production Program. The introduction of high-yielding varieties (HYVs), fertilizer, provision of irrigation, and improved agronomic practices resulted in the Green revolution in the 1960s and enhanced food grain production significantly over the years. The creation of the Department of Agricultural Research and Education (DARE), Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), and Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK) are the important milestones in Indian agriculture to get operation flood, yellow revolution, blue revolution, etc. Development of HYVs and hybrids of different agricultural and horticultural crops, a scientific package of practices for cultivation of crops, livestock, fisheries, and allied enterprises, availability of farm implements, post harvesting and processing technologies, supply on quality inputs like manures, fertilizer, pesticides, etc. and availability of institutional credit and procurement of produce further strengthen the Indian agriculture. Remote sensing technology is widely used for crop yield estimation, area expansion under specific crops in order to forecast the district/ regional level productivity, and also used to provide crop insurance to farmers for crop loss due to climatic or biotic stress. The use of no-till technology along with drip or sprinkler irrigation is the need of the hour for conserving our scarce natural resources and enhancing productivity and income. While biotechnology and genetic engineering have resulted in the development of varieties with pest resistance and increased crop yields, farm mechanization has led to efficient tilling, harvesting, water use, and a reduction in manual labor requirements. The development of location-specific different integrated farming systems (IFS) or integrated organic farming system (IOFS) models also helped enhance resource use efficiency, system productivity, and income of farmers. The use of information and communication technology and weather-based agro-advisories also help farmers' preparedness for forthcoming sporadic extreme weather events such as flash floods, drought, or pest outbreaks. The Indian population is slated to grow to about 1.7 billion by 2050. Food production has to be increased in the context of worsening land and water scarcity, soil degradation, multinutrient deficiency, and climate-change-related extreme weather events. The challenge is to find ways and means to produce enough quality to ensure food and nutritional security without deteriorating the environment. The challenge of producing more from reduced area and water under agriculture and minimizing post-harvest losses will have a major impact on agricultural development. Digital smart agriculture with the use of artificial intelligence, blockchain, remote sensing and GIS technology, use of drones and robots, etc. may take Indian agriculture to the next paradigm.","",https://doi.org/10.1007/978-981-19-7997-2_4,"",,
rayyan-224201669,Proposed Smart Water Management System,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Human activities, such as farming, heavy industries, energy generation and mining, significantly demand water resources necessary for life. With the population and water demand increasing, water must be efficiently managed to meet human needs with sufficient supply to protect our ecosystems. Reduced aquifer levels worldwide render human civilization vulnerable to escalating climate change. This paper proposes a priority-based embedded smart water management system based on FreeRTOS technology to address a unique problem where existing water supply systems are inefficiently managed due to the absence of a need-based allocation methodology. Sustainability can be achieved by maintaining a real-time balance of supply and demand to disperse the limited water supply. With FreeRTOS backbone, the proposed system can be fully integrated into an AI-based infrastructure to manage water supply with minimum human intervention efficiently. This research demonstrated that a priority-based real-time water resource distribution system could contribute up to 40% of water management improvement for buildings, farms, and cities.","",https://doi.org/10.1109/aca57612.2023.10346741,"",,

In this research, we employ the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) framework, a specific architecture of deep learning networks that is effective in processing time series data, for predicting soil moisture. We have developed the Next Generation Interactive Soil Moisture Forecasting System to advance skillful soil moisture predictions at sub-seasonal timescales by leveraging advanced analytics and deep learning, with LSTM at its core. We combined the state-of-the-art climate model's (Community Earth System Model Version 2) forecast that incorporates the effects of the large-scale climatic drivers, including sea-surface temperature and atmosphere circulation features into soil water forecast with the LSTM-based Deep Learning model. Our Deep Learning model understands the local forecast biases using the weekly hindcast data from 1999 to 2016. We used this trained LSTM model to test its performance from 2017 to 2021 and enhanced the forecast proficiency and aid in analyzing future soil moisture anomalies, i.e., departure from climatology using data fusion and spatial downscaling. For performance assessment, optimal metrics include Mean Absolute Error (MAE) values near 0 (0-0.6), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) around 0.5, and Anomaly Correlation Coefficient (ACC) nearing 1.

rayyan-224201683,Exploring the link between drought‐related terms and public interests: Global insights from LSTM‐based predictions and Google Trends analysis,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract Effective drought monitoring is of paramount importance in hydrology. It aids in mitigating the detrimental effects of water scarcity, facilitates sustainable resource management, and informs policy decisions. Therefore, it is crucial to comprehensively comprehend the dynamics and trends of drought‐related phenomena. This study aims to explore the relationship between six low water quantity terms including drought, water crisis, water scarcity, water shortage, water stress, and water insecurity and some socio‐economic, geographic, and demographic parameters for different regions of the world and to predict the future trend of public interest in the mentioned terms using Long Short‐Term Memory neural network (LSTM) models. Google Trend data analysis was used to examine the public interest in these terms from 2017 to 2022. The LSTM models were trained using historical data on the studied terms, and their performance was evaluated using Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) indicator. The Google Trend data analysis showed that public interest in water shortage and water insecurity increased significantly from 2017 to 2022. The LSTM models showed promising results for predicting future trends in the mentioned water related issues, with RMSE scores (dimensionless) ranging from 0.04 to 0.43. The most significant socio‐economic, geographic and demographic parameters were found to be population, life expectancy, access to drinking water, and access to Internet while there was no correlation between precipitation and searched terms. The results suggest that LSTM models can be an effective tool for forecasting water related issues and emphasizes the importance of socio‐economic, geographic and demographic parameters in the public search behaviour around the world. The study also highlights the increasing public awareness of water related issues and the need for sustainable water management practices, particularly in regions with high water shortage and insecurity. The LSTM‐based prediction models in this study have practical applications in early warning systems for droughts, community education on water conservation, prioritizing vulnerable areas, assessing public perception of climate change's relation to droughts, and evaluating water policies. Further research is needed to improve the accuracy of these models incorporating the effective parameters and to develop effective strategies for managing water resources in regions facing water scarcity.","",https://doi.org/10.1002/hyp.15016,"",,
rayyan-224201731,Modeling the discharge behavior of an alpine karst spring influenced by seasonal snow accumulation and melting based on a deep-learning approach,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Karst systems are challenging to model due to their heterogeneous hydraulic properties resulting in highly variable discharge behavior. Distributed models can be applied to karst aquifers but require detailed system knowledge and extensive hydraulic parameter datasets; lumped-parameter models are less complex, but still require parametrization. In this work, we demonstrate the application of a data-driven approach to model the discharge behavior of the Aubach spring in the Gottesacker karst system in the northern Alps, a well-investigated study site for which previous models are available for comparison (Chen et al. 2018; Fandel et al. 2020). Our approach is based on convolutional neural networks (CNN), which have proved to be well suited for time series forecasting in water-related contexts like runoff modelling or groundwater level prediction (Wunsch et al.). The approach is comparably simple in terms of data requirements as we rely mainly on widely available and easy-to-measure parameters such as precipitation and temperature. By implementing Bayesian techniques (Monte-Carlo dropout) we are able to report the predictive uncertainty of the CNN based forecasts. Our results challenge existing modelling results based on lumped-parameter models in terms of common error measures such as Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency. Furthermore, we explore the important role of snow accumulation and melting by coupling our model with a snow-routine to better represent their influence on spring discharge and further improve model performance.

However, current methods for soil moisture estimation exhibit several limitations that hinder their practical application. This study introduces a novel nowcasting model, which integrates in-situ and remote sensing data through a Predictive Error Compensated wavelet Neural NETwork (PECNET), addressing the drawbacks of existing approaches.Existing SM estimation techniques often suffer from limited accuracy, inadequate contextual information, and no real-time monitoring capabilities. Although remote sensing technologies offer promising advantages, such as wide spatial coverage and frequent data acquisition, they are not immune to limitations. Vegetation coverage and density present challenges in accurately estimating root-zone SM using remote sensing techniques. These factors can introduce uncertainties and errors in the estimation process, thereby impacting the reliability of the results.To overcome these limitations and enhance the accuracy of root-zone SM estimation, this study proposes the integration of remote sensing data with in-situ measurements. Specifically, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) calculations from Landsat 7 and Landsat 8 satellites are fused with evapotranspiration and rainfall data obtained from agrometeorological stations. Combining these datasets generates an 8-day time series for the target parcels, leveraging the contextual information provided by NDVI and seasonality to improve the accuracy of root-zone soil moisture estimation.To develop a robust and efficient model, we introduce PECNET, which ensures the orthogonality of input features and facilitates the learning of non-linear relationships between variables. Notably, PECNET addresses the challenge of limited labeled training data, minimizing the risk of overfitting and enabling accurate estimation with fewer labeled samples. In addition, this study employs discrete wavelet transformation coefficients as inputs for the neural networks, demonstrating superior performance compared to direct measurements.Validation experiments were conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed PECNET model. Comparative analyses with simple regression, Kriging, and feed-forward neural networks reveal the significant advantages of the Predictive Error Compensated wavelet Neural NETwork approach in root-zone soil moisture estimation.In conclusion, this research introduces an advanced nowcasting model for root-zone SM estimation. By integrating in-situ and remote sensing data, harnessing contextual information, and utilizing state-of-the-art machine learning techniques, our approach overcomes the limitations of existing methods. It offers a robust solution for accurate soil moisture estimation, with implications for precision agriculture, water management, and decision-making related to agricultural practices and land resource utilization. However, the limitations imposed by vegetation coverage and density on remote sensing technologies should be considered when interpreting the results.","",https://doi.org/10.1109/agro-geoinformatics59224.2023.10233587,"",,
rayyan-224201860,An efficiency dynamic seasonal regression forecasting technique for high variation of water level in Yom River Basin of Thailand,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"<abstract> The Yom River Basin is one of 25 river basins in Thailand. The Yom River Basin experiences perennial droughts and floods that heavily impact the agricultural sector. In order to reduce the impact, water management, including water level estimation, must be applied to critical basins like the Yom River Basin. An important task of management is the quantitative prediction of water levels. Four different modeling approaches were applied to forecast the average monthly water level (AMWL) data from four water level measurement stations for the wet season (May–October) and dry season (November–April) from 2007 to 2020. The forecast patterns obtained from the four approaches were similar to the observed historical values, except the upstream in wet season and downstream in dry season. Furthermore, the artificial neural network (ANN) approach overestimated forecasts for almost every station in both seasons. All four approaches were more accurate in the dry season than the wet season. This study proposed a forecasting method called dynamic seasonal regression (DSR), which was obtained by combining multiple linear regression (MLR) and the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model of the random error from MLR. DSR was more efficient than ANN, seasonal-ARIMA (SARIMA) and a hybridized SARIMA and ANN approach (SARIMANN). On average, for all stations in wet and dry seasons, DSR reduced RMSE by over 40.86%, 9.10% and 23.07% with respect to ANN, SARIMA and SARIMANN, and MAPE by over 35.01%, 13.02% and 15.96% with respect to ANN, SARIMA and SARIMANN. The RMSE of upstream was higher than the RMSE downstream in the wet season for all methods, and the MAPE of upstream was lower than the downstream in both seasons for all methods. Moreover, the RMSE of upstream was lower than the downstream in the dry season for all methods except the ANN method. </abstract>","",https://doi.org/10.3934/environsci.2021019,"",,

Conventional field studies of plant–water relations are fundamental for understanding the mechanisms of how plants alter and adapt to environmental changes, while large-scale studies can be more practical for regional land use and water management towards mitigating climate change impacts. In this study, we investigated the changes in the total water storage (TWS), aridity index (AI) and vegetation greenness, productivity, and their interactions in the Pearl River basin since April 2002. Results show an overall increasing trend of vegetation greenness and productivity, especially in the middle reaches where TWS also increased. This region dominated by croplands was identified as the hot spot for changes and interactions between water and vegetation in the basin. Vegetation was more strongly affected by TWS than precipitation (P) at both the annual and monthly scales. Further examination showed that the influence of TWS on vegetation in dry years was stronger than wet years, while the impact of P was stronger in wet years than dry years; moreover, vegetation productivity responded slower but stronger to atmospheric dryness in dry years than wet years. The lag effects resulted in nonlinearity between water and vegetation dynamics. This study implies that vegetation in the basin uses rainwater prior to water storage until the soil becomes dry, and their dynamics indicate that vegetation development is subject to water availability, and that vegetation is not dominant in reducing water availability.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-25-4741-2021,"",,
rayyan-224201885,Urban non-point source pollution modelling: A physics-informed neural network approach,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Over the past decades, urban non-point source (NPS) pollution has been the most severe threat to the urban water environment. The sharp increase of impervious surface and the high level of particulate matter from massive human activities exacerbated the water quality of surface runoff, leading to the significant urban NPS pollution globally whereby it is of importance to have a deep knowledge on the accumulation and transport of pollutants. A series of traditional physical models have been developed to simulate the runoff generating as well as the NPS pollution. However, a disadvantage of process-based modelling is its great demand for a large amount of field data which may normally be inaccessible, as well as the demand for the expertise in applying appropriate modelling method on specific study area. Empirical models do not characterize complex physical processes of NPS pollution and thus require fewer data and modelling skills. Nevertheless, the limitation is that these modelling approaches are region-sensitive and spatially untransferable. It is challenging to fill the gap between the requirement of urban water environment management and existing modelling performance on NPS pollution, in the absence of a more effective model with high accuracy, easy employment, and spatial transferability.Machine learning approach has been utilized in environmental studies for decades, and was originally believed to be a black box that can barely provide any physical insight into environmental processes. However, an approach named physics-informed neural networks (PINN) was proposed lately and then applicated in dynamical system. This approach embeds differential equations of priori knowledge into neural network to make modelling interpretable and generalizable. In this study, a physical process embedded LSTM network was proposed to formulate the cumulation and transport of urban NPS pollution in rainfall runoff, based on the coupling of LSTM and differential equations of classic exponential build-up/wash-off processes. Water quality data of urban runoff from sampling and continuous real-time monitoring campaigns distributed in China, USA and New Zealand were collected and fed into proposed network to model the primary NPS pollutant TSS. The results revealed that the hybrid PINN model excels the vanilla LSTM approach and auto-calibrated SWMM approach in accuracy and convenience. The interpretable model also enhanced the cross-catchment transferability of model for urban water management in data-poor area. In addition, the trained parameters of network units were found consistent with the prior knowledge of accumulation and transport of NPS pollutants, indicating the deep coupling of neural network and physical process. As a very early case of hybrid AI modelling in urban NPS pollution, this study provided a new perspective on water quality modelling and can help in improving the standards of urban environment governance.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu23-2543,"",,

However, progress is impeded by limited data access due to privacy concerns or high costs, and by the absence of data that depict rare or extreme events. Rare or extreme events are particularly important for assessing robustness and resilience of systems since they represent the status for which they are designed. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) can address these challenges by learning data distributions to generate artificial data. In this study, first, we explored the potential uses of GANs in urban water management. Next, as a proof of concept, we tested one primary application of GANs, specifically data augmentation. We used GANs to generate synthetic time series to balance our data set. The results demonstrate that the suggested approach slightly enhances the accuracy of combined sewer water depth predictions. Additionally, a model trained using only synthetic data was found to be comparable to one trained using real data.","",https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4379728,"",,
rayyan-224201973,Uncertainty Quantification of Granular Computing-neural Network Model for Prediction of Pollutant Longitudinal Dispersion Coefficient in Aquatic Streams,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract Discharge of pollution loads into natural water systems remains a global challenge that threatens water/food supply as well as endangers ecosystem services. Natural rehabilitation of the polluted streams is mainly influenced by the rate of longitudinal dispersion ( D x ), a key parameter with large temporal and spatial fluctuates that characterizes pollution transport. The large uncertainty in estimation of D x in streams limits evaluation of water quality in natural streams and design of water quality enhancement strategies. This study develops a sophisticated model coupled with granular computing and neural network models (GrC-ANN) to provide robust prediction of D x and its uncertainty for different flow-geometric conditions with high spatiotemporal variability. Uncertainty analysis of D x GrC-ANN model was based on the alteration of training data fed to tune the model. Modified bootstrap method was employed to generate different training patterns through resampling from a 503 global database of tracer experiments in streams. Comparison between the D x values estimated by GrC-ANN to those determined from tracer measurements show the appropriateness and robustness of the proposed method in determining the rate of longitudinal dispersion. GrC-ANN model with the narrowest bandwidth of estimated uncertainty (bandwidth- factor =0.56) that brackets the most percentage of true D x data (i.e., 100%) is the best model to compute D x in streams. Given considerable inherent uncertainty reported in other D x models, the D x GrC-ANN model is suggested as a proper tool for further studies of pollutant mixing in turbulent flow systems such as streams.","",https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1036627/v1,"",,

With the increasing over-utilization of shallow wells in dambos for smallholder irrigation, this study was carried out to investigate whether dambo groundwater reserves could serve as sustainable irrigation water sources and to examine the aquifer characteristics in Linthipe sub basin. Vertical Electrical Sounding (VES) points were established in the basin using the Schlumberger configuration array. Data was analysed using IPI2win and Surfer software applications. Contrary to other commercial software applications which are costly for government departments when analysing geophysical data, partial curve matching and one dimensional (1-D) computer iteration techniques were used to interpret the VES curves and the pseudo-cross section resistivity profiles due to their simplicity and cost-effectiveness. The study has revealed that the aquifer properties in the basin are exceptionally variable in terms of state of weathering, depth, thickness, lithology, aquifer recharge configuration, geologic material and hydraulic gradients. These variations showed that the shallow wells in the basin have significant fractures suggesting high water potential for climate smart irrigation usage in the study area. The potential groundwater zones for climate smart irrigated farming were detected at VES 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 noted by low aquifer resistivity with high values of aquifer thickness. However, VES points, 7, 8 and 9 were likely to be zones of low water bearing potential because they had high values of aquifer resistivity with low aquifer thickness. The findings also validated the effectiveness, timeliness, and efficiency of using vertical electrical resistivity technique in exploring groundwater for irrigation. The results from this study have highlighted that feasible shallow well depth for a sustainable irrigation system is a function of geologic resistance and aquifer thickness when the geologic material has low resistance and broader thickness. This study noted that knowledge of aquifer recharge rates in dambos is required in order to effectively control abstraction rates for sustainable irrigation in basins. There is a need to promote the usage of geophysical studies, reforestation, river basin management trainings and aquifer recharge technologies in exploring sites for shallow well development for irrigation. The study further recommends the usage of geographical information systems (GIS) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) in improving the results of groundwater monitoring studies in Malawi.","",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e08346,"",,
rayyan-224202162,Response of U.S. West Coast Mountain Snowpack to Local Sea Surface Temperature Perturbations: Insights from Numerical Modeling and Machine Learning,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract Sea surface temperature (SST) significantly modulates the precipitation and temperature over land, with important consequences on land surface processes such as snowpack. Compared to the impact of remote SST, the effect of nearshore/local SST is less well understood. In this study, the impact of local SST on the mountain snowpack of the U.S. West Coast is investigated using two 6-km regional climate simulations driven by the same lateral boundary conditions but with time-varying versus time-invariant and warmer local SSTs during 2003–15. Results show that local SST warming leads to warmer winter with more precipitation over the mountains. Meanwhile, the removal of SST temporal variability results in reduced temperature variability but increased precipitation variability. As a result, winter snow accumulation decreases by ~200 mm per season in the Cascade Mountains in the north but increases by ~100 mm per season in the Sierra Nevada in the south. Such a dipole response results from the competing effects of precipitation and temperature change at different elevations and are amplified by the enhanced atmospheric river moisture transport. To further delineate the relative contributions of different meteorological factors to the snowpack response, two neural network models were developed to predict the snow behaviors at seasonal and monthly scales. These models reveal the dominant influence of the total amount and the average temperature of precipitation on the snowpack response. These findings highlight the sensitivity of mountain snowpack to local SST in the western United States and underscore the importance of local SST and atmospheric rives to accurate snowpack estimations for water management.","",https://doi.org/10.1175/jhm-d-20-0127.1,"",,

rayyan-224202215,Convolutional Neural Networks Regression Model with Uncertainty Estimates to predict GEDI Canopy height at 30m resolution using multisource SAR and optical observations,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Accurate estimates of forest aboveground biomass (AGB) are essential for assessing forest carbon stocks and their change over time to support policies for climate change mitigation, resource management, and biodiversity conservation. Among the methodologies to estimate AGB, those that include accurate forest canopy height (CH) information present better estimates due to the direct relationship between AGB and CH. Therefore, to cover large areas, Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) remote sensing technology is preferred because it can provide highly accurate and precise measurements of the distance from the ground to the top of the canopy. However, developing continuous acquisition campaigns using LiDAR technology at continental scales at high-spatial resolution is too expensive. &amp;#160; The Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) offers a unique opportunity to overcome this challenge. The GEDI mission uses a laser instrument mounted on the International Space Station (ISS) to measure the distance from the ISS to the Earth&amp;#8217;s surface with high accuracy and spatial resolution. However, GEDI does not provide a spatially continuous CH map. Instead, it captures 25 m spatial resolution footprint samples over the Earth&amp;#8217;s surface following a sparse-grid-based sampling pattern between 51.6&amp;#176; N and 51.6&amp;#176; S. In this acquisition setup, the samples are spaced every 60 m in the along-track direction and 600 m in the across-track direction. &amp;#160; To estimate CH for areas not covered by the sparse GEDI mission, we propose a non-linear mapping function using Convolutional Neural Networks with Uncertainty estimates (UCNNs) with input data from other satellites and output a continuous estimate of&amp;#160;CH with a measure of uncertainty. Specifically, we use coregistered multitemporal data from Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, and ALOS PALSAR. From Sentinel imagery, we use bimonthly composites each year from April-May, June-July, and August-September to capture the dynamics of the spectral and structural tree information in Canada. From ALOS PALSAR, we use the one-year composite, and from GEDI data, we use strong-beam samples from June to July from the corresponding year, while excluding all low-quality samples. Experiments were conducted for 2020 in the Province of Ontario, Canada, whose climate is considered continental, with temperatures ranging from humid in the south, with cold winters and warm summers, to sub-Arctic in the north. To avoid overfitting, we apply spatial cross-validation splitting the study region into five non-overlapping areas. The cumulative uncertainty histogram shows that 90% of samples present an uncertainty of&amp;#160;CH less than 5 meters. These results are the first step towards spatially continuous mapping of canopy height using multitemporal and multisource satellite data, with implications for improving assessment of forest biomass estimation and carbon monitoring from space.&amp;#160;","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu23-10091,"",,
rayyan-224202281,A Method of Multi-Stage Reservoir Water Level Forecasting Systems: A Case Study of Techi Hydropower in Taiwan,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Reservoirs in Taiwan often provide hydroelectric power, irrigation water, municipal water, and flood control for the whole year. Taiwan has the climatic characteristics of concentrated rainy seasons, instantaneous heavy rains due to typhoons and rainy seasons. In addition, steep rivers in mountainous areas flow fast and furiously. Under such circumstances, reservoirs have to face sudden heavy rainfall and surges in water levels within a short period of time, which often causes the water level to continue to rise to the full level even though hydroelectric units are operating at full capacity, and as reservoirs can only drain the flood water, this results in the waste of hydropower resources. In recent years, the impact of climate change has caused extreme weather events to occur more frequently, increasing the need for flood control, and the reservoir operation has faced severe challenges in order to fulfil its multipurpose requirements. Therefore, in order to avoid the waste of hydropower resources and improve the effectiveness of the reservoir operation, this paper proposes a real-time 48-h ahead water level forecasting system, based on fuzzy neural networks with multi-stage architecture. The proposed multi-stage architecture provides reservoir inflow estimation, 48-h ahead reservoir inflow forecasting, and 48-h ahead water level forecasting. The proposed method has been implemented at the Techi hydropower plant in Taiwan. Experimental results show that the proposed method can effectively increase energy efficiency and allow the reservoir water resources to be fully utilized. In addition, the proposed method can improve the effectiveness of the hydropower plant, especially when rain is heavy.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/en14123461,"",,

Recent projections show that drought events are expected to increase in frequency and intensity due to climate change. According to studies conducted by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), 83% of all damages and losses caused globally by drought between 2006 and 2016 have been absorbed by agriculture, putting a large part of the world’s population at risk of food insecurity. This study shows the advantage of scaling-up FAO’s agricultural drought monitoring and early warning system (ASIS) and building the bridge with the anticipatory action, drought financial mechanisms, social protection and other initiatives for preventing the deterioration of food security and strengthening resilience. The results of the methodology that is based on and supported by the digital innovation, machine learning, matured knowledge and experiences accumulated over the past 10 years are illustrated with practical examples from different countries, ecological environments and crops. A fused time series of Advanced Very-High-Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) data from Meteorological Operational satellite (METOP) and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) was used to produce a consistent time series of a vegetation health index (VHI) at 1 km spatial resolution from 1984 to present. VHI is multiplied by the crop coefficient (kc) to provide more responsiveness to the VHI anomaly that occurs during sensitive phenological phases to water stress such as a flowering and grain filling. The weighted VHI (wVHI) is integrated from the start of the season (SOS) up to the end of season (EOS). Once the temporal analysis of wVHI is completed, the spatial average is calculated using the values of pixels within a specific crop mask and administrative unit. The system proposed different vegetation indices to assess the impact of drought in agriculture; including an agricultural drought forecast that provide more time to the decision makers for implementing anticipatory actions to mitigate the drought in agriculture. Next generation agricultural stress index system (ASIS) offers full capabilities to support: parametric crop insurance, social protection schemes, early action, national drought management plans and to guide public investments.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/rs13050959,"",,

In particular, it can be demonstrated that temporal variations in surface water temperature in a reservoir have strong responses to air temperature. We adopted deep neural networks (DNNs) to understand the long-term relationships between air temperature and surface water temperature, because DNNs can easily deal with nonlinear data, including uncertainties, that are obtained in complicated climate and aquatic systems. In general, DNNs cannot appropriately predict unexperienced data (i.e., out-of-range training data), such as future water temperature. To improve this limitation, our idea is to introduce a transfer learning (TL) approach. The observed data were used to train a DNN-based model. Continuous data (i.e., air temperature) ranging over 150 years to pre-training to climate change, which were obtained from climate models and include a downscaling model, were used to predict past and future surface water temperatures in the reservoir. The results showed that the DNN-based model with the TL approach was able to approximately predict based on the difference between past and future air temperatures. The model suggested that the occurrences in the highest water temperature increased, and the occurrences in the lowest water temperature decreased in the future predictions.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/w13081109,"",,

rayyan-224202476,Modeling reservoir surface temperatures for regional and global climate models: a multi-model study on the inflow and level variation effects,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract. The complexity of the state-of-the-art climate models requires high computational resources and imposes rather simplified parameterization of inland waters. The effect of lakes and reservoirs on the local and regional climate is commonly parameterized in regional or global climate modeling as a function of surface water temperature estimated by atmosphere-coupled one-dimensional lake models. The latter typically neglect one of the major transport mechanisms specific to artificial reservoirs: heat and mass advection due to in- and outflows. Incorporation of these essentially two-dimensional processes into lake parameterizations requires a trade-off between computational efficiency and physical soundness, which is addressed in this study. We evaluated the performance of the two most used lake parameterization schemes and a machine learning approach on high-resolution historical water temperature records from 24 reservoirs. Simulations were also performed at both variable and constant water level to explore the thermal structure differences between lakes and reservoirs. Our results highlight that surface water temperatures in reservoirs differ significantly from those found in lakes, reinforcing the need to include anthropogenic inflow and outflow controls in regional and global climate models. Our findings also highlight the efficiency of the machine learning approach, which may overperform process-based physical models both in accuracy and in computational requirements, if applied to reservoirs with long-term observations available. A relationship between mean water retention times and the importance of inflows and outflows is established: reservoirs with the retention time shorter than ~100 days, if simulated without in- and outflow effects, tend to exhibit a statistically significant deviation in the computed surface temperatures regardless of their morphological characteristics.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-2021-64,"",,

Since the beginning of this century, Europe has been experiencing severe drought events (2003, 2007, 2010, 2018, and 2019) which have had adverse impacts on various sectors, such as agriculture, forestry, water management, health, and ecosystems. During the last few decades, projections of the impact of climate change on hydroclimatic extremes were often capable of reproducing changes in the characteristics of these extremes. Recently, the research interest has been extended to include reconstructions of hydro-climatic conditions to provide historical context for present and future extremes. While there are available reconstructions of temperature, precipitation, drought indicators, or the 20th century runoff for Europe, long-term runoff reconstructions are still lacking (e.g, monthly or daily runoff series for short periods are commonly available). Therefore, we considered reconstructed precipitation and temperature fields for the period between 1500 and 2000 together with reconstructed scPDSI, natural proxy data, and observed runoff over 14~European catchments to calibrate and validate the semi-empirical hydrological model GR1A and two data-driven models (Bayesian recurrent and long short-term memory neural network). The validation of input precipitation fields revealed an underestimation of the variance across most of Europe. On the other hand, the data-driven models have been proven to correct this bias in many cases, unlike the semi-empirical hydrological model GR1A. The comparison to observed historical runoff data has shown a good match between the reconstructed and observed runoff and between the runoff characteristics, particularly deficit volumes.

These freshwater resources are crucial for food and water security, and the sustainability of natural and managed systems. The spatial-temporal properties of groundwater are often overlooked, despite these subsurface reservoirs being linked to aboveground water use and ecosystem processes. In this study, we assessed the spatial-temporal changes of water table depth in the conterminous United States (U.S.) over the last three decades (1989-2019). National Ground-Water Monitoring Network water table depth data were paired with climate and terrain features. Interpolated maps were created by combining machine learning (i.e., gradient boosted regression trees) with traditional interpolation methods (i.e., Kriging). Water table depth is shallower in the eastern U.S., as compared to western U.S., except for high elevation locals which consistently had deeper water tables. The overall change in depth to water table for the conterminous U.S. was ~1m indicating that on average the water is getting deeper. Of the 56 aquifer systems, 41 are in areas where the water table has gotten deeper. These results highlight current “hotspots” of possible depletion where water management efforts should focus. Management of this crucial resource is essential for mitigating negative impacts of depletion, which may ultimately feedback further amplifying changes in climate.","",https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-582187/v1,"",,

Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is one of the vital sensors for monitoring the distribution and change of surface water, especially when encountering severe weather. However, the precision of water extraction from SAR images is still unsatisfactory due to the high false alarms rates over urban fringes and mountainous regions. In this paper, an improved method combining modified Markov random field (MRF) with convolutional neural network (CNN) model is proposed to extract surface water bodies from SAR image. Firstly, the initial water maps are obtained by training CNN-based model. Secondly, the primary water maps are subsequently modified by the MRF model with Gamma distribution, which could significantly reduce the false alarms and misclassifications in the water maps. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy has been validated based on Sentinel-1 SAR images, which are four typical application scenes with different characteristics of water resources. The experimental results show that the overall classification accuracy of the proposed method is much higher than that of the other methods. The proposed framework has the potential for water detection from SAR images, which are essential for water management and monitoring.","",https://doi.org/10.1109/icivc58118.2023.10270690,"",,
rayyan-224202658,A Simple Way to Increase the Prediction Accuracy of Hydrological Processes Using an Artificial Intelligence Model,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Rainfall and evaporation, which are known as two complex and unclear processes in hydrology, are among the key processes in the design and management of water resource projects. The application of artificial intelligence, in comparison with physical and empirical models, can be effective in the face of the complexity of hydrological processes. The present study was prepared with the aim of increasing the accuracy in monthly prediction of rainfall (R) and pan evaporation (EP) by providing a simple solution to determining new inputs for forecasting scenarios. Initially, the prediction of two parameters, R and EP, for the current and one–three lead times, by determining the different input modes, was developed with the SVM model. Then, in order to increase the accuracy of the predictions, the month number (τ) was added to all scenarios in predicting both the R and EP parameters. The results of the intelligent model using several statistical indices (i.e., root mean square error (RMSE), Kling–Gupta (KGE) and correlation coefficient (CC)), with the help of case visual indicators, were compared. The month number (τ) was able to greatly improve the prediction accuracy of both the R and EP parameters under the SVM model and overcome the complexities within these two hydrological processes that the scenarios were not initially able to solve with high accuracy. This is proven in all time steps. According to the RMSE, KGE and CC indices, the highest increase in the forecast accuracy for the upcoming two months of rainfall (Rt+2) for Ardabil station in scenario 2 (SVM-2) was 19.1, 858 and 125%, and for the current month of pan evaporation (EPt) for Urmia station in scenario 6 (SVM-6), this occurred at the rates of 40.2, 11.1 and 7.6%, respectively. Finally, in order to investigate the characteristic of the month number in the SVM model under special conditions such as considering the highest values of the R and EP time series, it was proved that by using the month number of the SVM model, again, the accuracy could be improved (on average, 17% improvement for rainfall, and 13% for pan evaporation) in almost all time steps. Due to the wide range of effects of the two variables studied in the hydrological discussion, the results of the present study can be useful in agricultural sciences and in water management in general and will help owners.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/su13147752,"",,
rayyan-224202689,Food Security and Inaccurate Quantification of Groundwater Irrigation Use,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Maintaining food security for an increasing global population while experiencing global climate change and avoiding ecologic damage is a serious challenge for the scientific community. We know that crop yields from irrigated agriculture are approximately twice that of dry land farming thus, irrigated agriculture is a critical component of that security. Whereas agriculturalists are changing cultivation practices and genetically modifying varieties to “get more crop for the drop,” little is being done to resolve our twin groundwater crises of depletion and pollution. Even worse, there has been a vast underestimation of the volume of groundwater used in irrigation. According to the UN approximately 40% of global irrigation is groundwater from wells, the remaining 60% is from surface water. The United States Geological Survey reports similar estimates with groundwater amounting to approximately 50% of irrigation water used in the United States. This accounting method (wells or surface-water sources) of irrigation water use ignores a fundamental hydrologic tenet that globally, approximately half of the surface water is composed of groundwater baseflow. Thus, groundwater use for global irrigation is approximately 70% of the total (40% from wells plus one half of the 60% classified as surface water). Consequently, the twin groundwater crises are of a much greater impact to food security than is generally recognized. Compounding this error is the prediction that water consumption will likely increase in the future. According to the World Water Assessment Program of the United Nations, increasing water demand follows population growth, economic development and changing consumption patterns. Global water demand has increased by 600% over the past 100 years according to a 2016 study by Wada and others. Current global water demand is projected to grow over the next two decades in agriculture as well as industry and domestic uses, water, however, is a finite non-fungible resource for most uses and in many areas all water is allocated. The groundwater crisis revolves around two components (1) excessive groundwater depletion and (2) pollution of the aquifers. Aquifers are being overdeveloped to such a large degree that this extracted water is contributing approximately 10–15% of the annual sea level rise. The depletion is causing reduction in the flow of the riverine environment at a time when climate change is exacerbating water problems. One third of the world's large aquifers are depleted beyond rejuvenation owing to permanent compression and subsidence. Pollution of groundwater generally decreases its value and limits it use. For example, a significant portion of anthropogenic nitrogen is recharged into groundwater so that anthropogenic nitrate is now three times the geogenic values. Further, the total mass of nitrate in groundwater now being transported in groundwater discharge is a substantial contribution to eutrophication of rivers, lakes, and ocean estuaries. If the input of anthropogenic nitrogen to groundwater were to cease today, it would take five or six decades for this “legacy” nitrogen to be discharged from the aquifer. To understand and manage groundwater resources for food security it is necessary to have effective groundwater monitoring networks that provide transparent results to the citizenry for quality and water levels. This is rare in even the high-income countries. Sadly, most countries are not seriously investing in establishing and modernizing this critical infrastructure, though China has recently established such a network. Part of the problem is the lack of remote sensing of our critical parameters. Whereas atmospheric and ocean science parameters are readily accessible, through new remote sensing methods, groundwater monitoring is largely limited to 19th century technology of wells. We have improved data collection and numerical modeling including Geospatial Machine Learning but not remote access to critical parameters with the exception of GRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment). Consequently, we believe that education and knowledge synthesis, to inform the public for the need for action, is currently the most immediate realistic solution to the crisis. We need to take advantage of the existing vast knowledge and experience that is fragmented and siloed across the globe. Yet effective knowledge synthesis and dissemination are beyond the traditional mandate of existing organizations. In response to this deficiency, the not-for-profit the Groundwater Project (gw-project.org) was created in 2017. The purpose of the group is to lead the way, on a global scale, toward an informed citizenry and groundwater management with the vision: “Providing free knowledge tools for developing groundwater sustainably for humanity and ecosystems.” Education, with the resulting public awareness in the general population, currently appears to be the most likely way out of our global groundwater crisis and consequent lack of food security.","",https://doi.org/10.1111/gwat.13122,"",,
rayyan-224202823,Digital Twin Water Management Platform - Innovative approach for optimal water management,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Recently, digitalization has impacted drought and flood forecasting systems, and makes the application of technologies and advanced data processing techniques in the water management field possible. Especially, digital twin in the field of water management aims to effectively diminish unprecedented water-related issues such as floods and droughts using 3D objects and high-resolution spatial data. Climate change effects are expected to increase flood and drought risk through more frequent heavy precipitation and global temperature rise, and the water disaster sector is so complex, dynamic, and unpredictable that requires sophisticated management systems.

rayyan-224202853,Forecasting discharges through explainable machine learning approaches at an alpine karst spring,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Karst springs provide drinking water for approximately 700 million people worldwide. Complex subsurface flow processes lead to challenges for modelling spring discharges. Machine learning (ML) models possess the ability to learn non-linear patterns and show promising results in forecasting dynamic spring discharge. We compare the performance of three ML models of varying complexity in forecasting karst spring discharges: the multivariate adaptive regression spline model (MARS), a feed-forward neural network (ANN) and a long short-term memory model (LSTM). The well-studied alpine karst spring LKAS2 in Austria is used as test case. We provide model explanations including feature attribution through Shapley additive explanations (SHAP), a method based on Shapley values. Our results show that the higher the model complexity, the higher the accuracy, based on the evaluated symmetric mean absolute percentage error of the three investigated models. With SHAP every prediction can be explained through each feature in each input time step. We found seasonal model differences. For example, snow influenced the model mostly in winter and spring. Analyzing the combinations of input time steps and features provided further insights into the model performance. For instance, the SHAP results showed that a high electrical conductivity in recent time steps, which indicates that the karst water is less diluted with precipitation, leads to a reduced discharge forecast. These feature attribution results coincide with physical processes within karst systems. Therefore, the introduced SHAP method can increase the confidence in ML model forecasts and emphasizes the raison d&amp;#8217;&amp;#234;tre of complex and accurate deep learning models in hydrology. This allows the operator to better understand and evaluate the model&amp;#8217;s output, which is essential for drinking water management.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu23-15604,"",,

Jakarta, Indonesia's capital, faces frequent flooding, mainly due to the overflowing Ciliwung River. Effective flood prevention, like timely warnings, is crucial to reduce losses. Yet, the existing flood early warning system managed by the Ciliwung-Cisadane River Center has limitations. Its hydrological models for short-term predictions lack accuracy, leading to prolonged computational times. To enhance this system, a machine learning approach was introduced for better water level prediction. This model utilizes rainwater and runoff data from four river segments upstream. Two neural network methods, Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) and Recurrent Neural Network-Long Short-Term Memory (RNN-LSTM), were compared. RNN-LSTM outperformed ANFIS, displaying lower error rates and faster computation times. It excelled in predictive capabilities for three of four river segments, evident through improved Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). Despite a minor setback in the third segment's performance, both methods scored well in the coefficient of determination (R2). RNN-LSTM emerged superior due to its minimal error and efficient computational speed, making it the preferred choice for water level prediction. Additionally, RNN-LSTM showcases enhanced predictive ability concerning water level fluctuations, as reflected in its larger standard deviation.","",https://doi.org/10.1109/skima59232.2023.10387360,"",,

Therefore, predicting their occurrence is a crucial task for efficient disaster management and for the protection of life, property, infrastructure and cultural assets. In recent years Deep Learning methods gained popularity on the research field on flood forecasting methods &amp;#8211; Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks being part of them.Efficient disaster management needs a fine temporal resolution of runoff predictions. Past work at TU Dresden on LSTM networks shows certain challenges when using input data with hourly resolution, such as systematically poor timing in peak flow prediction (Pahner et al. (2019) and Morgenstern et al. (2021)). At times, disaster management even requires flood forecasts for hitherto unobserved catchments, so in total a regionally transferable rainfall-runoff model with a fine temporal resolution is needed. We derived the idea for a potential approach from Kratzert&amp;#160;et&amp;#160;al.&amp;#160;(2019) and Fang et al. (2021): they demonstrate that LSTM networks for rainfall(R)-runoff(R)-modeling benefit from an integration of multiple diverse catchments in the training dataset instead of a strictly local dataset, as this allows the networks to learn universal hydrologic catchment behavior. However, their training dataset consists of daily resolution data.Following this approach, in this study we train the LSTM networks using single catchments (""local network training"") as well as combinations of diverse catchments in Saxony, Germany (""regional network training""). The training data (hourly resolution) consist of area averages of observed precipitation as well as of observed discharge at long-term observation gauges in Saxony. The gauges belong to small, fast-responding Saxon catchments and vary in their hydrological and geographical properties, which in turn are part of the network training as well.We show the preliminary results and investigate the following questions:With a finer temporal resolution than daily values, characteristics of flood waves become more pronounced. Concerning the detailed simulation of flood waves, do regional LSTM-based R-R-models enable more accurate and robust flow predictions compared to local LSTM-based R-R-models &amp;#8211; especially for rare extreme events?

rayyan-224202943,Evaluation of lagoon eutrophication potential under climate change conditions: A novel water quality machine learning and biogeochemical-based framework.,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Lagoons are highly valued coastal environments providing unique ecosystem services. However, they are fragile and vulnerable to natural processes and anthropogenic activities. Concurrently, climate change pressures, are likely to lead to severe ecological impacts on&amp;#160;lagoon&amp;#160;ecosystems. Among these, direct effects are mainly through changes in temperature and associated physico-chemical alterations, whereas indirect ones, mediated through processes such as extreme weather events in the catchment, include the alteration of nutrient loading patterns among others that can, in turn, modify the trophic states leading to depletion or to eutrophication. This phenomenon can lead, under certain circumstances, to harmful algal blooms events, anoxia, and mortality of aquatic flora and fauna, or to the reduction of primary production, with cascading effects on the whole trophic web with dramatic consequences for aquaculture, fishery, and recreational activities. The complexity of eutrophication processes, characterized by compounding and interconnected pressures, highlights the importance of adequate sophisticated methods to estimate future ecological impacts on fragile lagoon environments. In this context, a novel framework combining Machine Learning (ML) and biogeochemical models is proposed, leveraging the potential offered by both approaches to unravel and modelling environmental systems featured by compounding pressures. Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and Random Forest (RF) models are used (trained, validated, and tested) within the Venice Lagoon case study to assimilate historical heterogenous WQ data (i.e., water temperature, salinity, and dissolved oxygen) and spatio-temporal information (i.e., monitoring station location and month), and to predict changes in chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) conditions. Then, projections from the biogeochemical model SHYFEM-BFM for 2049, and 2099 timeframes under RCP 8.5 are integrated to evaluate Chl-a variations under future bio-geochemical conditions forced by climate change projections. Annual and seasonal Chl-a predictions were performed out by classes based on two classification modes established on the descriptive statistics computed on baseline data: i) binary classification of Chl-a values under and over the median value, ii) multi-class classification defined by Chl-a quartiles. Results from the case study showed as the RF successfully classifies Chl-a under the baseline scenario with an overall model accuracy of about 80% for the median classification mode, and 61% for the quartile classification mode. Overall, a decreasing trend for the lowest Chl-a values (below the first quartile, i.e. 0.85 &amp;#181;g/l) can be observed, with an opposite rising fashion for the highest Chl-a values (above the fourth quartile, i.e. 2.78 &amp;#181;g/l). On the seasonal level, summer remains the season with the highest Chl-a values in all scenarios, although in 2099 a strong increase in Chl-a is also expected during the spring one. The proposed novel framework represents a valuable approach to strengthen both eutrophication modelling and scenarios analysis, by placing artificial intelligence-based models alongside biogeochemical models.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu23-8409,"",,

rayyan-224202988,Impact of Spatial Distribution Information of Rainfall in Runoff Simulation Using Deep-Learning Methods,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract. Rainfall-runoff modelling is of great importance for flood forecast and water management. Hydrological modelling is the traditional and commonly used approach for rainfall-runoff modelling. In recent years, with the development of artificial intelligence technology, deep learning models, such as the long short-term memory (LSTM) model, are increasingly applied to rainfall-runoff modelling. However, current works do not consider the effect of rainfall spatial distribution information on the results, and the same look-back window is applied to all the inputs. Focusing on two catchments from the CAMELS dataset, this study first analyzed and compared the effects of basin mean rainfall and spatially distributed rainfall data on the LSTM models under different look-back windows (7, 15, 30, 180, 365 days). Then the LSTM+1D CNN model was proposed to simulate the situation of short-term look-back windows (3, 10 days) for rainfall combined with the long-term look-back windows (30, 180, 365 days) for other input features. The models were evaluated using the Nash Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient, root mean square error, and error of peak discharge. The results demonstrate the great potential of deep learning models for rainfall runoff simulation. Adding the spatial distribution information of rainfall can improve the simulation results of the LSTM models, and this improvement is more evident under the condition of short look-back windows. The results of the proposed LSTM+1D CNN are comparable to those of the LSTM model driven by basin mean rainfall data and slightly worse than those of spatially distributed rainfall data for corresponding look-back windows. The proposed LSTM+1D CNN provides new insights for runoff simulation by combining short-term spatial distributed rainfall data with long-term runoff data, especially for catchments where long-term rainfall records are absent.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-2021-371,"",,
rayyan-224202989,Introducing DL-GLOBWB: a deep-learning surrogate of a process-based global hydrological model,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Process-based global hydrological models are an important tool for sustainable development and policy making in today&amp;#8217;s water-scarce world. These models are able to inform national to regional scale water management with basin-scale accounting of water availability and demand and project the impacts of climate change and adaptation on water resources. However, the increasing need for better and higher resolution hydrological information is proving difficult for these state-of-the-art process-based models as the associated computational requirements are significant.Recently, the deep-learning community has shown that neural networks (in particular the LSTM network) can provide hydrological information with an accuracy that rivals, if not exceeds, that of process-based hydrological models. Although the training of these neural networks takes time, prediction is fast compared to process-based simulations. Nevertheless, training is mostly done on historical observations and thus projections under climate change and adaptation are uncertain.Inspired by the complementary strengths and weaknesses of the process-based and deep-learning approaches, we present DL-GLOBWB: a deep-learning surrogate of the state-of-the-art PCR-GLOBWB global hydrological model. DL-GLOBWB predicts all water-balance components from the process-based model, including human water demand and abstraction, with a nRSME of 0.05 (range between 0.0001 and 0.32). The DL-GLOBWB surrogate is orders of magnitudes faster than its process-based counterpart, especially as surrogates trained at low resolutions (e.g. 30 arc-minute) can effectively be downscaled to higher resolutions (e.g. 5 arc-minute).In addition to introducing DL-GLOBWB, our presentation will explore future applications of this deep-learning surrogate, such as (1) improving model calibration and performance by comparing DL-GLOBWB outputs with ins-situ data and satellite observations; (2) training DL-GLOBWB on &amp;#160;future model projections to include global change; and (3) the implementation of DL-GLOBWB to dynamically, and at high resolution, visualize the impact of climate change and adaptation to stakeholders.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu23-4842,"",,
rayyan-224203020,On detecting signals of anthropogenic climate change in basin-scale hydrologic variables,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Anthropogenic climate change is one of the most pressing global environmental challenges faced by society in recent times. Large-scale shifts are observed in precipitation and runoff patterns due to the impact of anthropogenic climate change on the regional water cycle. Understanding these impacts is critical for effectively managing and protecting water resources and for mitigating the impacts of climate change. However, the detection of the impact of anthropogenic climate change on the regional water cycle is challenging. A pattern correlation analysis using fingerprints can be carried out to evaluate the impacts of human-induced climate change. Fingerprints give the expected direction of the anthropogenic signal and help to reduce the detection problem to a univariate or low-dimensional problem. This study adopts a formal fingerprint-based detection method to analyze the trends in monsoon precipitation and streamflow in the Krishna River basin, India. In-situ observations and several climate model outputs are utilized for the analyses. Principal component analysis, statistical downscaling techniques, and an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) based rainfall-runoff model are employed. The fingerprint detection method is illustrated using three scenarios by altering the anthropogenic forcings: aerosols alone, land use alone, and a combination of greenhouse gases with aerosols. The hydrologic variables considered are the gridded monthly monsoon precipitation data for 1951-2005 at 1&amp;#176; latitude by 1&amp;#176; longitude and monthly monsoon streamflow at a downstream gauging station. Leading Empirical Orthogonal Functions (EOFs) and signal strength are used to compare the response pattern of observed hydrologic variables with the response pattern simulated by climate models, including various forcings. The hypothesis that the observed trend in hydrologic variables lies within the range expected from natural internal variability alone is validated at a 95% statistical confidence level for most of the climate models considered. This excludes the possibility of other causal factors, including solar irradiance, volcanic eruption, and other anthropogenic impacts. It is found that the signal of human influence is less distinct from that of natural variability. Hence, it is concluded that applying a formal fingerprint-based method is not fully successful in detecting anthropogenic trends in hydrologic variables at the basin scale. The results emphasize the need for robust observational data and advanced analytical techniques considering a detailed process understanding.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu23-2684,"",,

In the Eastern Mediterranean region, which contains arid and semi-arid areas, the location and timing of rainfall is the most significant factor in the formation of flash floods. Predicting when and where extreme weather events such as storms, heavy rainfall, and flooding are likely to happen is a key challenge in the effort to prevent natural disasters. Here, we present an improved version of a previous work by Ziskin and Reuveni, which investigated the use of precipitable water vapor (PWV) data from ground-based global navigation satellite system (GNSS) stations, along with surface pressure measurements to predict flash floods in an arid region of the eastern Mediterranean. The previous study involved training three machine learning models to perform a binary classification task, using multiple unique flash flood events and testing the models using a nested cross-validation technique.

In this study, we extend the previous work by integrating nearby lightning data as a new feature in our studied dataset. The inclusion of this feature is motivated by the observation that heavy rainfall, which can lead to flood events, is often accompanied before by an increase in lightning activity. The experimental results show that the adding a 24-hour vector of nearby lightning activity improves the precision score significantly.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu23-9979,"",,
rayyan-224203222,Improving thermodynamic profile retrievals from microwave radiometers by including Radio Acoustic Sounding System (RASS) observations,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract. Thermodynamic profiles are often retrieved from the multi-wavelength brightness temperature observations made by microwave radiometers (MWRs) using regression methods (linear, quadratic approaches), artificial intelligence (neural networks), or physical-iterative methods. Regression and neural network methods are tuned to mean conditions derived from a climatological dataset of thermodynamic profiles collected nearby. In contrast, physical-iterative retrievals use a radiative transfer model starting from a climatologically reasonable value of temperature and water vapor, with the model run iteratively until the derived brightness temperatures match those observed by the MWR within a specified uncertainty. In this study, a physical-iterative approach is used to retrieve temperature and humidity profiles from data collected during XPIA (eXperimental Planetary boundary layer Instrument Assessment), a field campaign held from March to May 2015 at NOAA's Boulder Atmospheric Observatory (BAO) facility. During the campaign, several passive and active remote sensing instruments as well as in-situ platforms were deployed and evaluated to determine their suitability for the verification and validation of meteorological processes. Among the deployed remote sensing instruments was a multi-channel MWR, as well as two radio acoustic sounding systems (RASS), associated with 915-MHz and 449-MHz wind profiling radars. Having the possibility to combine the information provided by the MWR and RASS systems, in this study the physical-iterative approach is tested with different observational inputs: first using data from surface sensors and the MWR in different configurations, and then including data from the RASSs. These temperature retrievals are also compared to those derived by a neural network method, assessing their relative accuracy against 58 co-located radiosonde profiles. Results show that the combination of the MWR and RASS observations in the physical-iterative approach allows for a more accurate characterization of low-level temperature inversions, and that these retrieved temperature profiles match the radiosonde observations better than all other approaches, including the neural network, in the atmospheric layer between the surface and 5 km AGL. Specifically, in this layer of the atmosphere, both root mean square errors and standard deviations of the difference between radiosonde and retrievals that combine MWR and RASS are improved by ~0.5 °C compared to the other methods. Pearson correlation coefficients are also improved.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-2021-9,"",,

Severe droughts, resulting in decreased groundwater recharge, led to declining groundwater levels in many regions and even local drinking water shortages have occurred in past summers. We investigate how climate change will directly influence the groundwater resources in Germany until the year 2100. For this purpose, we use a machine learning groundwater level forecasting framework, based on Convolutional Neural Networks, which has already proven its suitability in modelling groundwater levels. We predict groundwater levels on more than 120 wells distributed over the entire area of Germany that showed strong reactions to meteorological signals in the past. The inputs are derived from the RCP8.5 scenario of six climate models, pre-selected and pre-processed by the German Meteorological Service, thus representing large parts of the range of the expected change in the next 80 years. Our models are based on precipitation and temperature and are carefully evaluated in the past and only wells with models reaching high forecasting skill scores are included in our study. We only consider natural climate change effects based on meteorological changes, while highly uncertain human factors, such as increased groundwater abstraction or irrigation effects, remain unconsidered due to a lack of reliable input data. We can show significant (p&amp;lt;0.05) declining groundwater levels for a large majority of the considered wells, however, at the same time we interestingly observe the opposite behaviour for a small portion of the considered locations.

Typically, these statistical relationships, which can be learnt employing many different statistical and machine learning models, are subsequently applied to downscale future global climate model (GCM) simulations, obtaining local projections for the region and variables of interest.&amp;#160;A posteriori random forests (APRFs) were introduced in a recent paper (Legasa et al., 2021) for precipitation downscaling, but can be potentially used to estimate any probabilitydistribution. While performing similarly to other state-of-the-art machine learning methodologies like convolutional neural networks in terms of predictive performance (as measured in terms of correlation of the downscaled series with the observed series), APRFs produce less biased simulations, as measured by several distributional indicators.Furthermore, climate change signals projected by APRFs are consistent with those given by the raw GCM outputs, thus proving suitable for downscaling local climate change scenarios (Legasa et al. 2023, in review). Moreover, they also automatically select the most adequate large-scale variables and geographical domain of interest, a time-consuming task and potential source of uncertainty (Manzanas et al. 2020) when downscaling climate change projections.In this work we show how the APRF methodology can be easily extended to more complex and multivariate distributions. One of the proposed extensions is temporal APRFs, which explicitly model the transition in time for a variable and location of interest (e.g. the rainfall probability conditioned to the dry/wet state of the previous day), thus improving the temporal consistency of the downscaled series in terms of several temporal (e.g. spells) indicators. Other possible extensions within the APRF framework include predicting the joint probability distribution of several geographical locations, thus improving the spatial consistency of the downscaled series; and modeling the multivariate joint distribution of different meteorological variables (e.g. precipitation, humidity and temperature). &amp;#160; References Guti&amp;#233;rrez, J.M., Maraun, D., Widmann, M. et al.

A Case Study in Southern Mexico,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Streamflow simulation is an important aspect for water management and risk assessment. This task requires good-quality meteorological data; however, observations are not easy to obtain. This study evaluates the use of Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Networks (LSTM) in streamflow simulation, and its results were compared with the conceptual hydrological model GR4J. The study site is the Papagayos River basin, located in southern Mexico. Meteorological data from five ground stations as well as three high-resolution gridded meteorological datasets were selected. Results show that the estimates of precipitation and temperature have important differences in terms of correlation, spread, and mean values. The streamflow simulations were compared in terms of the Nash Sutcliffe Efficiency Coefficient, and results show a better performance of LSTM over GR4J. In addition, LSTM better simulate low and medium flows which are overestimated by GR4J. All in all, the use of LSTM provides reliable discharge simulations and can be used as a tool for risk evaluation in basins with scarce observed meteorological data.","",https://doi.org/10.1109/enc60556.2023.10508664,"",,

Predicting river discharge and water levels has been a subject of hydrological modelling and a topic of serious research. However, only in recent years scholars and practitioners have turned to consider earth observation data for their studies, mainly to compare evidence of flood mapping. We present an approach of using earth observation data to feed AI architectures &amp;#8211; EO4AI &amp;#8211; and produce forecasts for discharge and water level with significant degrees of accuracy. &amp;#160;Our starting point is that river discharge and water levels depend on a variety of meteorological and environmental factors like precipitations, snow cover, soil moisture, vegetation index and satellite data offer rich variety of datasets, supplying this information. We adopt a pipeline of deep learning architectures consisting of GAN, CNN, LSTM and EA to actually generate forecasts for river discharge and water level by using historic satellite data of the meteorological features listed above, and in-situ measurements for water level and discharge. The satellite data are provided by ADAM&amp;#160; via the NoR service of ESA. ADAM provides data access to satellite datasets from different satellites with semantic relevance for the construction of sediment transport and deposition forecast model as discussed above.&amp;#160; We explain the purpose of the pipeline components. Our forecast models are calibrated for 3, 5, 7, 30 days ahead, and our experiments provide predictions for one year ahead with each of the calibrated models. We discuss experiment results carried out with data from the Danube and Arda rivers, including three dams from cascade Arda and compare them with predictions derived with other methods. We demonstrate the viability of the approach and the reliability of the forecasting results. We further show how the forecasts can be used in hydrodynamic modelling context, for early warning applications and for routine water resources management and monitoring tasks.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu23-17141,"",,

It has been stated that technical programming for managing groundwater resources is not available given the contemporary industrial revolution. The availability of these solutions will facilitate information access and streamline the groundwater management procedure. The Jukskei River is one of Johannesburg, South Africa's largest rivers. Since then, the population of the Jukskei River has increased to around 400,000. Water supplies in the Jukskei basin are therefore under extreme stress. The Jukskei catchment was surveyed to ascertain the groundwater management status to address the difficulties. The survey was conducted by looking at the readily accessible groundwater records and the rationally written papers of the many research conducted in the area. Groundwater infrastructure was used to identify and track crucial indicators, such as groundwater level, and establish groundwater patterns. The association between the identified groundwater parameters in the catchment region and the identified borehole was plotted using a geographic information system (GIS) at the catchment level. A technology/app based on blockchain, and artificial intelligence is being developed for groundwater monitoring and will be pretested on one borehole in the Jukskei watershed. The results showed that there are gaps in the data records and that the monitoring team needs to be trained and equipped. Since there is no access to regulation terms (such as meters), official accreditation of monitoring capabilities and apparatus (such as meters) is required. There is a need to build many groundwater level monitoring stations in a certain segment, considering demands and human requirements as per normal densities in distinct locations of South Africa. Groundwater level raw data should be transformed into marketable products, such as concise reports on sensitive locations (such as dolomite compartments, wetlands, aquifers, and solitary sources). Groundwater monitoring infrastructure has been vandalized and stolen during the rising civil turmoil. This study's data will be utilized to compare changes in the catchment area to changes in the borehole in terms of the parameters mentioned. This data will be entered into computer processing software, after which an application will be created using that information. Based on data from the borehole, this program will be able to forecast results for the groundwater catchment region.","",https://doi.org/10.1109/icecet58911.2023.10389276,"",,

Selecting the Tarim river basin as an example to deep people's understanding of runoff change, explores the runoff concentration variation, association with extreme climate change as well as its future change under different SSPs with four machine learning methods.New hydrological insights for the region: The Gini coefficient of runoff decreases by 8.3%, while the annual runoff increases by 14.2%. The result is related to the extreme temperature change, leading the uncertainty of hydrology risk increasing. The anomaly of low geopotential high field and Central Asian anticyclones making the total cloud cover (TCC) and precipitation increased, promoting DTR decreased significantly.

However, the climatic effect of warm season runoff is weaker than that in cold season, the sharp increase of runoff in cold season contributes to the runoff concentration decline. Under the three scenarios, the average Gini coefficient of Aksu river and Hotan river decreased by 3% and 4.7%, while the decrease trend in Yarkant river was not significant.

Urbanization has led to an increase in impervious surfaces, which alters hydrological flow pattern and delivers non-point pollutants to the stream more efficiently.

Hence, it is necessary to understand the impact of surrounding environment with specific emphasis on geographical factors (e.g. climate change, land use patterns and landscape metrics) on the RWQ in order to develop sustainable water quality management strategies effectively.

Results:The study showed that various teleconnection patterns were effective depending on the type of sub-basin and time step.Prediction results showed that the difference between observational and modeled data in the training period was small and increased somewhat in the test period and reached about -25.7 to 47.6 mm in the whole sub-basins.Thoughtfulness of the type of analytical model showed that both SVR and MLP models had higher accuracy than GRNN and MLR models, so that the Root Mean Square Error by SVR model in Aras, Atrak, Haraz-Sefidrood, Qarahsu-Gorgan, 7.34, 35.44, 18.25, 19.58, 17.68 and 47.22 mm, respectively, and the coefficient of determination will be 0.94, 0.91, 0.92, 0.84, 0.88, 0.88 and 0.87, respectively.Conclusion: Therefore, the results show a strong relationship between teleconnection indices with autumn rainfall in the study basin.These include NAO, SOI, AO and Caspian and Mediterranean Sea surface temperatures at different time delays.With these results, steps can be taken to more accurately predict and manage the water resources of the Caspian Sea basin.","",https://doi.org/10.52547/jwmr.12.24.228,"",,

While numerous studies have addressed changes in temperature and precipitation patterns at different spatiotemporal scales for assessing hydroclimatic variability, similar analyses on regional evapotranspiration trends are limited. This can be attributed to lack of observed records of ETo at regional scales, and highlights the need for developing better models for estimating this variable. To address this research gap, we developed monthly 0.5&amp;#176; gridded ETo dataset for entire Germany using machine learning techniques and then investigated the temporal trends in ETo over the region. We utilized flux tower data (sensible heat flux, net radiation, soil heat flux, and latent heat flux) from multiple locations in the region to compute observed ETo using the surface energy balance method. Then, fed-forward back-propagation method (BPNN) is used for predicting monthly ETo with easily available input predictors such maximum temperature, minimum temperature, precipitation, soil moisture, short wave radiation, and wind speed. The BPNN is trained with various input combinations in order to estimate ETo with minimal input predictors, and their performance is assessed using metrics: coefficient of determination, mean absolute error, and root mean square error. The results showed that with all the input parameters, the coefficient of determination &amp;#160;for training and testing are 0.89 and 0.93 respectively, while the best parsimonious model (precipitation and downward shortwave radiation as predictors) gives 0.88 and 0.93 respectively.

The increasing occurrence of flash droughts due to climate change calls for a better understanding of the terrestrial ecosystem responses to flash drought events. Here we study the ecological impact of flash drought in Europe between 2001 and 2020. To do this, we define flash drought events based on soil moisture percentiles and compare temporal behaviours of various ecological data obtained from satellite observations and machine learning-supported upscaled in-situ measurements. We find that in arid regions, an abrupt transition to water-stressed conditions occurs within a few weeks, negatively affecting vegetation status and reducing carbon uptake in the initial stages of drought. By contrast, vegetation in humid regions is not as severely affected, given that soil moisture recovers relatively quickly. We also show that soil moisture status before the onset of drought significantly impacts the timing and degree of drought-induced vegetation stress, particularly in arid regions. Our study highlights the regional characteristics of flash drought impacts, contributing to better drought adaptation and management strategies. Moreover, our observational evidence of ecosystem responses to flash drought can be used as a reference to evaluate land surface models&amp;amp;#8217; performance.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu23-10835,"",,

While in-situ soil moisture and vegetation biomass measurements can provide detailed information, their representativeness is limited, and networks of sensors are not widely available. Multispectral satellite observations offer global coverage, but retrievals can be infrequent or too coarse to capture the local extremes. This observation data gap limits the use of such information to adequately represent land surface processes and their initialization conditions for seasonal to sub-seasonal (S2S) prediction models. To bridge this gap, the assimilation of remote sensing observations into land surface models at hyper-resolution spatial scales (&amp;lt; 100 meters) provides a pathway forward to (i) reconcile model and observation scales and (ii) enhance S2S hydroclimate predictability in Earth System Models.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;To this aim, we introduce a scalable approach that leverages advances in machine learning, radiative transfer modeling, and in-situ observations to assimilate satellite observations into unstructured tile-based land surface models. In this approach, a machine learning model is trained to harness information from big environmental datasets and in-situ observations to learn how the physical model and satellite biases are related to specific hydrologic conditions and landscape characteristics and how these biases evolve over time. We demonstrate the added value of this approach for improving soil moisture and vegetation dynamics at the hyper-resolution scales by assimilating MODIS Leaf Area Index and NASA&amp;amp;#8217;s SMAP brightness temperature observations into the LM4.0 &amp;amp;#8211; the land model component of the NOAA-GFDL Earth System Model.

Thereby, the vegetation affects the climate through changes in its structure (such as leaf area index, LAI) and its physiology (such as stomatal conductance); However, their relative contributions and respective processes on the land-atmosphere coupling are not yet understood. For instance, increased LAI, referred to as structural changes, promotes transpiration and vegetation productivity, and increases the surface albedo in most cases. In contrast, decreased surface conductance, referred to as physiological changes, could reduce transpiration and productivity. Therefore, the overall feedback of vegetation to climate change via water, carbon and energy exchange will depend on the relative importance of structural and physiological responses. Here we study to what extent dynamic changes in global vegetation structure and physiology modulate land-atmosphere coupling using satellite remote-sensing, data-driven, and earth system modelled vegetation data, as well ashydro-meteorological reanalysis. The land-atmosphere coupling is quantified through the correlation between soil moisture and lagged vapor pressure deficit determined with a moving time window. We employ random forests to quantify vegetation physiology by accounting for functional variability (e.g. GPP and ET) explained by hydro-meteorological data but not by the vegetation structure. Then using an explainable machine learning approach (SHAP), we determine the contributions of vegetation structure and physiology where we find overall larger contributions of structure on regulating land-atmosphere coupling during the growing season. The relative importance of vegetation structure differs across ecosystems, with stronger contributions in dry ecosystems. Furthermore, we analyze the variations of the relevance of vegetation structure over time and in particular during warm and dry periods. The results are partially backed up by using in-situ measurements of physiological traits to interpret the large-scale observed physiological patterns.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu23-10417,"",,

For this, a river routing model derived from the CETEMPS Hydrological model (CHyM) forced with the CORDEX-CORE total runoff was used to simulate the daily river flow at 0.06&amp;#186; spatial resolution from 1976 to 2099 and under the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5. For the analysis of hydrological droughts, a block minima approach based on the annual minimum 7-day river flow (7AMF) was selected for the nonfrost season (i.e., the period when the upstream area of a given river point presents a mean temperature above 0 &amp;#186;C). These values were fitted to a Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distribution and the minimum flow for different return periods were computed for a reference period and for conditions of 1.5&amp;#186;, 2&amp;#186;, and 3&amp;#186;C above temperatures in the pre-industrial period.

Large-scale network initiatives such as the Fluxnet allow us to better understand the environmental controls on the evapotranspiration and gross primary productivity. An important aspect of such initiatives is that its large number of sites allow for localized knowledge to be upscaled to a region or even globally. This can be either done by employing physics-based global land models or empirically, via data-driven approaches. Particularly, we have seen a significant increase of data-driven approaches with the use of machine learning techniques more recently. Here, we use a similar structure employed in the FLUXCOM initiative to focus particularly on the role of soil moisture information in predicting evapotranspiration and gross primary productivity at several flux sites encompassing a wide range of hydroclimates and biomes around the globe. Our analyses employ a machine learning method to a predictive model of evapotranspiration and gross primary productivity, while focusing primarily on how changes in the way soil moisture is incorporated into the methodology affects such predictions. First, we evaluate the predictive power of this model when soil moisture is directly estimated via observations against more indirect estimates via bucket-type models. Secondly, we evaluate the role of the spatial resolution of different soil moisture estimates in predicting both fluxes. We do this by using three sets of direct estimates covering distinct spatial footprints co-located at all flux sites: (1) point-scale time-domain reflectometers, (2) field-scale cosmic-ray neutron sensors, and (3) regional-scale satellite remote sensing products. In this talk, we summarize which hydroclimatic regions benefit from having direct estimate of soil moisture for evapotranspiration and gross primary productivity, while also providing some insights on the possible role of spatial scale mismatches between the fluxes and soil moisture.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu23-12444,"",,

Water as a natural resource is significantly affected by numerous physical, chemical, and biological factors that negatively impact it. Water pollution can be monitored by collecting water samples for laboratory or in situ analyses using multiparameter analysis. Sensors, models, and artificial intelligence–based techniques have been applied in recent times in the water domain. There are new designs being developed with a system of multiple sensors that monitor water pollution. Some examples of sensor networks used to detect water pollution include wireless networks with several sensor nodes which are used to measure temperature, pH, electrical conductivity, dissolved oxygen (DO), etc. The data or information obtained is employed in assessing current conditions and patterns over time and space to comprehend and manage the influence of extraneous factors, such as land use and climate. Measuring and monitoring the key indicators of water quality aid researchers and environmentalists in achieving a benign aquatic ecosystem, which notably affects underwater flora and fauna, and implementing policies to conserve water domains and encourage biodiversity and the overall protection of the environment.","",https://doi.org/10.1201/9781003260455-6,"",,
rayyan-224204036,The expected effect of climate change on snowfall amounts and snow depth in the major urban areas of Romania,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Snowfall and snow depth are important elements of the climate system which can have a significant impact on the transport sector, local economy, water resources and local thermal regime.This study aims to identify the future trends of snowfall and snow depth in the most important urban areas in Romania, based on high-resolution regional climate models (RCM) data, made available through the EURO-CORDEX, and bias-corrected RCM simulations available &amp;#238;n the RoCliB dataset. Ten different regional climate models with a target resolution of 10 km and two emission scenarios were considered, namely the moderate (RCP4.5) and business-as-usual (RCP8.5) scenarios. The study covers the interval from 2021 to 2100. In order to predict the future snow depth, snow cover duration and snowfall amounts based on the available parameters from the RCM simulations, it was necessary to identify the complex relationship between snowfall, snow melting, temperature and precipitation. In order to do this, we first extracted the ERA5 reanalysis data from 1981 to 2020 for each urban area, and then employed a Bayesian Regularized Neural Network (BRNN). The resulting model was used to predict the future variables for all major urban areas in Romania.A general trend of decreasing snowfall amounts, mean snow depth and snow cover duration was observed for all analyzed areas and for both emission scenarios. Important regional variations were also observed, with some areas no significant change for the 2021 &amp;#8211; 2050 interval compared to the observation period, which could be explained mostly by the increasing winter precipitation predicted by the RCM simulation. The results also showed an increased possibility of some years virtually lacking any snow cover and snowfall precipitation, especially after 2050 in the business-as-usual scenario (RCP8.5). However, an increased variability was also observed, with extreme snowfall events remaining possible even in the latter half of the study interval.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu23-12497,"",,

The aging infrastructure needs more efficient decision support systems to help water utilities make renewal prioritization and renewal decisions. Fortunately, with the developments in computational techniques and data collection through advanced sensors, it is now possible to support prioritization of critical water pipelines with data and knowledge. Previous studies have found that around two trillion gallons of treated drinking water are wasted through 240 000 water main breaks per year in the United States. The costs associated with fixing these water pipeline failures are not only for replacing the pipe but also include many other indirect costs like loss of human-hours due to traffic disruptions, property damage due to flooding, and disruption of service to critical facilities like hospitals, medical centers, and primary schools. This underlines the need to further enhance the consequence of failure (CoF) assessment tools available to water utilities to identify critical pipelines and understand the risk for renewal prioritization. This study was performed to advance the state of the art in assessing the CoF based on a comprehensive list of parameters and utilizing a novel hierarchical fuzzy inference system (FIS) to support better renewal decisions for water pipelines based on criticality. This study will help water utilities to build data-driven decision support systems and to advance their asset management programs. The results in this study are based on analysis of water pipeline data collected from over 500 water utilities in the US and can provide an indication of overall criticality of water pipelines in the US. PIPE i D has been created to help in understanding the critical drinking water pipeline infrastructure. It is envisioned to be a national database platform for advanced asset management addressing the major management levels, including strategic, tactical, and operational, that will assist water utilities of all sizes in sustaining targeted levels of service with acceptable risk. It will also provide secure access to aggregated data, models, and tools, which will enable the synthesis, analysis, querying, and visualization of the data for decision support. With the help of PIPE i D, it becomes possible to incorporate the many previous models and develop a systematic and comprehensive approach in the statistical modeling of water pipeline performance prediction.

rayyan-224204050,Climate Monitoring SAF: Sustained Generation of Satellite-Based Climate Data Records,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"In recent decades climate variability and change have caused impacts on natural and human systems on all continents. Observations are needed to understand and document these impacts and its causes. Such observations are increasingly based on remote sensing from satellites which offer global scale and continuous coverage. Only long-term and consistent observations of the Earth system allow us to quantify climate variability and change and their impacts on the natural and human dimension. Since more than 20 years, the European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT) Satellite Application Facility on Climate Monitoring (CM&amp;#160;SAF, https://www.cmsaf.eu) develops capabilities for a sustained generation and provision of Climate Data Records (CDRs) derived from primarily operational meteorological satellites. The product portfolio of the CM&amp;#160;SAF comprises long time series of Essential Climate Variables (ECVs) related to the energy and water cycles as defined by the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS). Currently available CM&amp;#160;SAF CDRs include, among others, surface and top of the atmosphere radiative fluxes, cloud products, surface albedo as well as latent heat flux/evaporation, precipitation and freshwater flux over the global ice-free oceans. The recent CDR versions cover the WMO reference period from 1991-2020, and several of the CM&amp;#160;SAF CDRs even have a temporal coverage of more than 40 years. In order to serve applications with strong timeliness requirements, CM&amp;#160;SAF also produces so-called Interim Climate Data Records (ICDRs), which are typically released within a few days of the observations. All products are well-documented, carefully validated and have been externally reviewed prior to product release. After a short introduction to CM&amp;#160;SAF and an overview of available and upcoming CDRs and ICDRs from CM&amp;#160;SAF, the presentation will focus on new releases of CDRs and ICDRs of clouds and radiation. The product portfolio was enhanced to also include the surface radiation budget and recent retrieval developments rely on artificial intelligence techniques. Examples from validation and applications using CM&amp;#160;SAF data records will also be introduced.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/ems2023-142,"",,
rayyan-224204130,Machine Learning Assisted Reservoir Operation Model for Long‐Term Water Management Simulation,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"ABSTRACT This study explores strategies for long‐term reservoir simulations by combining generic rule‐based reservoir management model (RMM) and machine learning (ML) models for two major multipurpose reservoirs — Allatoona Lake and Lake Sidney Lanier in the southeastern United States. First, a standalone RMM is developed to simulate daily release and storage during Water Year 1981–2015. Next, using Long‐Short Term Memory (LSTM) as the ML technique, a standalone LSTM model is trained based on reservoir inflow and meteorological observations to simulate reservoir release and estimate reservoir storage through water balance calculation. Three hybrid modeling strategies are developed, one using RMM output as an additional LSTM input (H1), another using LSTM as the initial release estimate in RMM (H2), and the third combining the first two strategies (H3). The Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) for release (NSE‐r), storage (NSE‐s), and their mean (NSE‐avg) are used for model evaluation. Overall, H1 improves NSE‐r to 0.65 and 0.54 for Allatoona and Lanier, respectively, compared to standalone RMM (0.44 and 0.21); however, its storage trajectory did not produce a physically feasible solution, similar to LSTM. H2 and especially H3 show that they can retain the best features from RMM and LSTM, with H3 NSE‐avg being 0.695 and 0.55 for Allatoona and Lanier outperforming RMM (0.615 and 0.29). The findings suggest a robust simulation capacity for large‐scale water management in future studies.","",https://doi.org/10.1111/1752-1688.13060,"",,
rayyan-224204287,Study of Membranes with Nanotubes to Enhance Osmosis Desalination Efficiency by Using Machine Learning towards Sustainable Water Management,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Water resources management is one of the most important issues nowadays. The necessity of sustainable management of water resources, as well as finding a solution to the water shortage crisis, is a question of our survival on our planet. One of the most important ways to solve this problem is to use water purification systems for wastewater resources, and one of the most necessary reasons for the research of water desalination systems and their development is the problem related to water scarcity and the crisis in the world that has arisen because of it. The present study employs a carbon nanotube-containing nanocomposite to enhance membrane performance. Additionally, the rise in flow brought on by a reduction in the membrane's clogging surface was investigated. The filtration of brackish water using synthetic polyamide reverse osmosis nanocomposite membrane, which has an electroconductivity of 4000 Ds/cm, helped the study achieve its goal. In order to improve porosity and hydrophilicity, the modified raw, multi-walled carbon nanotube membrane was implanted using the polymerization process. Every 30 min, the rates of water flow and rejection were evaluated. The study's findings demonstrated that the membranes have soft hydrophilic surfaces, and by varying concentrations of nanocomposite materials in a prescribed way, the water flux increased up to 30.8 L/m2h, which was notable when compared to the water flux of the straightforward polyamide membranes. Our findings revealed that nanocomposite membranes significantly decreased fouling and clogging, and that the rejection rate was greater than 97 percent for all pyrrole-based membranes. Finally, an artificial neural network is utilized to propose a predictive model for predicting flux through membranes. The model benefits hyperparameter tuning, so it has the best performance among all the studied models. The model has a mean absolute error of 1.36% and an R2 of 0.98.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/membranes13010031,"",,

This environment is already highly influenced by the anthropogenic activities, but their importance is expected to rise up due to the forecasted increase of population (from 480 million people to 520-570 million by 2030) and ongoing climate change. These conditions will trigger an increase of human pressures, including urbanization, industrialization, the expansion of intensive agriculture activities (i.e., irrigation) and aquaculture, thus threatening the natural resources availability, and specifically the water availability. Droughts, floods and landslides events are already stepping up in this environment, making it urgent to develop models systems capable to predict the extreme complex and widespread climate variations of this area.ESA recognized the crucial role of this region by funding the Digital Twin Earth (DTE) Hydrology Evolution and the 4dMED projects, specifically dedicated to reconstruct the Mediterranean terrestrial water cycle at 1km spatial and 1 day temporal resolution and to develop a prototype of Digital Twin for the entire Mediterranean basin, which can be used for the prediction of hydrological extremes, the management of the water resource cycle and the simulation of the changes that the system may undergo. To reach those objectives, the latest developments of Earth Observation (EO) data as those derived from the ESA-Copernicus missions will be exploited together with in situ observations, hydrological and hydraulic models, artificial intelligence tools and advanced digital platform functionalities.Among the hydrologic variables datasets generated within these projects, precipitation holds a major role due to its influence on the natural hazards occurrence. Here, we show the procedure adopted to generate the high spatial and temporal resolution precipitation product over the Mediterranean region by downscaling and merging different satellite and in-situ precipitation products. The obtained dataset is evaluated against high resolution observed data in several region of the Mediterranean basin, in order to assess its performance with respect to others EO derived precipitation datasets.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu23-15320,"",,

The combination of these individual models achieved through simple averaging method, and further optimised using weighted averaging by K -nearest neighbour ( K -NN) and genetic algorithm (GA). The effectiveness of the proposed model was evaluated using real case study for Malaysia’s Kelantan River.

rayyan-224204361,Developing a random forest model to quantify streamflow intermittency in Pan-Europe at a spatial resolution of 15 arc-sec,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Intermittent streams, where water ceases to flow during some time, are a unique habitat for freshwater biota that are adapted to these conditions and provide many ecosystem services. Shifts in intermittency patterns, for example due to climate change, are problematic. To quantify streamflow intermittency in all of Europe at a spatial resolution of 15 arc-sec (approx.. 500 m), we developed a machine learning approach that combines daily streamflow observations, the output of a global hydrological model as well as other physiogeographic data to estimate monthly time series of the number of no-flow days.Daily streamflow observations at initially a selection of initially close to 2000 stations gauging stations across Europe from the SMIRES, GRDC and GSIM databases were used as target for training the ML model. We selected those stations with at least 18 complete (no day is missing) monthly records in the period 1980-2019. Predictors include monthly time series of simulated hydrological indicators at two spatial resolutions, 15 arc-sec (high resolution HR) and 0.5 arc-deg (approx. 50 km, low resolution LR) as well as static HR environmental indicators (e.g. drainage area). &amp;#160;The hydrological indicators were derived from the global hydrological model WaterGAP 2.2e. Its native LR output including surface runoff, and groundwater discharge was used for computing HR time series of monthly streamflow across all of Europe. A comparison of streamflow observations shows a reasonable fit to observations. HR hydrological indicators include specific streamflow in current and previous months.&amp;#160; Examples for LR hydrological predictors include the groundwater recharge to total runoff ratio and daily streamflow variability with each month.We considered a sequential statistical modeling approach (in the first stage: binary classification, and in the second stage: multiclass classification) owing to the zero-inflated and imbalanced data issues. In the first stage, a Random Forest (RF) model is built up to classify a binary classification of each month as either intermittent (with at least one no-flow day) or perennial. Then, by taking into account only those stations that were in the first step either predicted or observed to be intermittent, we developed another model to predict four classes of intermittency (e.g. with 1-2, 3-15, 16-27, 28-31 of no-flow days per month). A random oversampling of non-perennial gauging stations was implemented for both stages in order to address the biases in the RF model caused by the class imbalance in the training data. Three cross-validation techniques were applied for estimating the model performance, hyperparameter tuning, and model selection, including non-spatial, spatial, and spatial-temporal cross-validations. Balanced class accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and precision supported the model selected. The most important predictors for streamflow intermittency will be presented as well as the spatial distribution of the four intermittency classes in Europe (without Russia).","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu23-4440,"",,
rayyan-224204388,Monitoring of Inland Excess Water Inundations Using Machine Learning Algorithms,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Nowadays, climate change not only leads to riverine floods and flash floods but also to inland excess water (IEW) inundations and drought due to extreme hydrological processes. The Carpathian Basin is extremely affected by fast-changing weather conditions during the year. IEW (sometimes referred to as water logging) is formed when, due to limited runoff, infiltration, and evaporation, surplus water remains on the surface or in places where groundwater flowing to lower areas appears on the surface by leaking through porous soil. In this study, eight different machine learning approaches were applied to derive IEW inundations on three different dates in 2021 (23 February, 7 March, 20 March). Index-based approaches are simple and provide relatively good results, but they need to be adapted to specific circumstances for each area and date. With an overall accuracy of 0.98, a Kappa of 0.65, and a QADI score of 0.020, the deep learning method Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) gave the best results, compared to the more traditional machine learning approaches Maximum Likelihood (ML), Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and artificial neural network (ANN) that were evaluated.

rayyan-224204400,Comparison of machine learning techniques for reservoir outflow forecasting,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract. Reservoirs play a key role in many human societies due to their capability to manage water resources. In addition to their role in water supply and hydropower production, their ability to retain water and control the flow makes them a valuable asset for flood mitigation. This is a key function, since extreme events have increased in the last few decades as a result of climate change, and therefore, the application of mechanisms capable of mitigating flood damage will be key in the coming decades. Having a good estimation of the outflow of a reservoir can be an advantage for water management or early warning systems. When historical data are available, data-driven models have been proven a useful tool for different hydrological applications. In this sense, this study analyzes the efficiency of different machine learning techniques to predict reservoir outflow, namely multivariate linear regression (MLR) and three artificial neural networks: multilayer perceptron (MLP), nonlinear autoregressive exogenous (NARX) and long short-term memory (LSTM). These techniques were applied to forecast the outflow of eight water reservoirs of different characteristics located in the Miño River (northwest of Spain). In general, the results obtained showed that the proposed models provided a good estimation of the outflow of the reservoirs, improving the results obtained with classical approaches such as to consider reservoir outflow equal to that of the previous day. Among the different machine learning techniques analyzed, the NARX approach was the option that provided the best estimations on average.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-22-3859-2022,"",,
rayyan-224204403,Estimation of irrigation water quality index in a semi-arid environment using data-driven approach,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract The primary objective of this study was to calculate and assess the irrigation water quality index. Furthermore, an effective method for predicting IWQI using artificial neural network (ANN) and multiple linear regression (MLR) models was proposed. The accuracy performance of each model was evaluated at the end of this paper. According to the calculated index based on 49 groundwater samples, the Sidi El Hani aquifer was of good and sufficient quality. Moreover, both the ANN and MLR models performed well in terms of actual and predicted water quality. The ANN model, on the other hand, demonstrated the highest prediction accuracy. The results of this model also revealed that the predicted and computed values were close, with determination coefficients R2, RMSE, and MAE of about 0.95, 1.02, and 0.90, respectively. As a result, the proposed ANN model in this study was consistent and sufficient. These findings will help to guide irrigation water management decisions for the study aquifer in the future. The proposed ANN model can also be used to estimate the irrigation water index of other semi-arid aquifers, but accuracy is dependent on proper training techniques and selection parameters.","",https://doi.org/10.2166/ws.2022.157,"",,
rayyan-224204418,A Hybrid Framework for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting of Daily Urban Water Demand Using Attention-Based Convolutional Neural Network and Long Short-Term Memory Network,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Urban water demand forecasting is beneficial for reducing the waste of water resources and enhancing environmental protection in sustainable water management. However, it is a challenging task to accurately predict water demand affected by a range of factors with nonlinear and uncertainty temporal patterns. This paper proposes a new hybrid framework for urban daily water demand with multiple variables, called the attention-based CNN-LSTM model, which combines convolutional neural network (CNN), long short-term memory (LSTM), attention mechanism (AM), and encoder-decoder network. CNN layers are used to learn the representation and correlation between multivariate variables. LSTM layers are utilized as the building blocks of the encoder-decoder network to capture temporal characteristics from the input sequence, while AM is introduced to the encoder-decoder network to assign corresponding attention according to the importance of water demand multivariable time series at different times. The new hybrid framework considers correlation between multiple variables and neglects irrelevant data points, which helps to improve the prediction accuracy of multivariable time series. The proposed model is contrasted with the LSTM model, the CNN-LSTM model, and the attention-based LSTM to predict the daily water demand time series in Suzhou, China. The results show that the hybrid model achieves higher prediction performance with the smallest mean absolute error (MAE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and largest correlation coefficient (R2).","",https://doi.org/10.3390/su141711086,"",,

The world's water resources and India are under huge pressure because of rising demand and a limited supply. Proper water management is the only solution for ensuring a close gap between demand and supply. Hydrological modeling offers an answer to this issue by establishing relationships between different hydrological processes. Several models have been developed in the past decade to simulate the rainfall and runoff relations. Some models are simple conceptual models based on spatially distributed event-based or continuous and artificial intelligence (AI) models. This study aims to compare two conceptual daily-based models and one AI model developed for the Hemavathi sub-watershed in the Cauvery Basin (India). Two daily runoff models are implemented using conceptual models, i.e., Sacramento and the Australian water balance model (AWBM) using Rainfall-Runoff Library (RRL) tool and Feed forward Backpropagation neural network (FFBPNN) model. The models were calibrated for daily streamflow values from 1990 to 2006 and then validated from 2007 to 2015. The effectiveness of model runoff predictions is evaluated using statistical parameters such as Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) and Correlation coefficient (CC) values. The NSE values for the FFBPNN is 0.88 (calibration) and 0.74 (validation), Sacramento model is 0.66 (calibration) and 0.48 (validation), and 0.63 (calibration) and 0.44 (validation) for the AWBM model. From the obtained results, the FFBPNN model performs well in terms of NSE and CC compared to Sacramento and AWBM models.","",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.geogeo.2022.100153,"",,
rayyan-224204430,Hydrological Modelling and Climate Adaptation under Changing Climate: A Review with a Focus in Sub-Saharan Africa,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Empirical evidence continues to show that climate change remains a threat to the stability of the hydrologic system. As the climate system interacts with the hydrologic cycle, one significant repercussion of global warming includes changes in water availability at both regional and local scales. Climate change adaptation is intrinsically difficult to attain due to the dynamic earth system and lack of a comprehensive understanding of future climate and its associated uncertainties. Mostly in developing countries, climate adaptation is hampered by scarcity of good quality and adequate hydro-meteorological data. This article provides a synopsis of the modelling chain applied to investigate the response of the hydrologic system under changing climate, which includes choosing the appropriate global climate models, downscaling techniques, emission scenarios, and the approach to be used in hydrologic modelling. The conventional criteria for choosing a suitable hydrological model are discussed. The advancement of emission scenarios including the latest Shared Socioeconomic Pathways and their role in climate modelling, impact assessment, and adaptation, are also highlighted. This paper also discusses the uncertainties associated with modelling the hydrological impacts of climate change and the plausible approaches for reducing such uncertainties. Among the outcomes of this review include highlights of studies on the commonly used hydrological models for assessing the impact of climate change particularly in the sub-Saharan Africa region and some specific reviews in southern Africa. Further, the reviews show that as human systems keep on dominating within the earth system in several ways, effective modelling should involve coupling earth and human systems models as these may truly represent the bidirectional feedback experienced in the modern world. The paper concludes that adequate hydro-meteorological data is key to having a robust model and effective climate adaptation measures, hence in poorly gauged basins use of artificial neural networks and satellite datasets have shown to be successful tools, including for model calibration and validation.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/w14244031,"",,
rayyan-224204435,Training machine learning with physics-based simulations to predict 2D soil moisture fields in a changing climate,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"The water content in the soil regulates exchanges between soil and atmosphere, impacts plant livelihood, and determines the antecedent condition for several natural hazards. Accurate soil moisture estimates are key to applications such as natural hazard prediction, agriculture, and water management. We explore how to best predict soil moisture at a high resolution in the context of a changing climate. Physics-based hydrological models are promising as they provide distributed soil moisture estimates and allow prediction outside the range of prior observations. This is particularly important considering that the climate is changing, and the available historical records are often too short to capture extreme events. Unfortunately, these models are extremely computationally expensive, which makes their use challenging, especially when dealing with strong uncertainties. These characteristics make them complementary to machine learning approaches, which rely on training data quality/quantity but are typically computationally efficient. We first demonstrate the ability of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to reproduce soil moisture fields simulated by the hydrological model ParFlow-CLM. Then, we show how these two approaches can be successfully combined to predict future droughts not seen in the historical timeseries. We do this by generating additional ParFlow-CLM simulations with altered forcing mimicking future drought scenarios. Comparing the performance of CNN models trained on historical forcing and CNN models trained also on simulations with altered forcing reveals the potential of combining these two approaches. The CNN can not only reproduce the moisture response to a given forcing but also learn and predict the impact of altered forcing. Given the uncertainties in projected climate change, we can create a limited number of representative ParFlow-CLM simulations (ca. 25 min/water year on 9 CPUs for our case study), train our CNNs, and use them to efficiently (seconds/water-year on 1 CPU) predict additional water years/scenarios and improve our understanding of future drought potential. This framework allows users to explore scenarios beyond past observation and tailor the training data to their application of interest (e.g., wet conditions for flooding, dry conditions for drought, etc…). With the trained ML model they can rely on high resolution soil moisture estimates and explore the impact of uncertainties.","",https://doi.org/10.3389/frwa.2022.927113,"",,

The use of artificial intelligence (AI) in tracking and predicting water quality parameters has surpassed the use of other conventional methods. This study presents the assessment of three main models: adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), artificial neural network (ANN) and multiple linear regression (MLR) on water quality parameters of Wangchu river located at capital city of Bhutan. The performance and predictive ability of these models are compared and the optimal model for predicting the parameters are recommended based on the coefficient correlation (CC), root mean square error (RMSE) and Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) evaluation criteria. Overall NSE and RMSE, the ANN model predicted parameters with maximum efficiency of 97.3 percent and minimum error of 8.57. The efficiency of MLR and ANFIS model are 95.9 percent and 94.1 percent respectively. The overall error generated by MLR and ANFIS are 10.64 and 12.693 respectively. From the analysis made, the ANN is recommended as the most suitable model in predicting the water quality parameters of Wangchu river. From the six-training function of ANN, trainBR (Bayesian Regularization) achieved the CC of 99.8%, NSE of 99.3% and RMSE of 9.822 for next year data prediction. For next location prediction, trainBR achieved CC of 99.2%, NSE of 98.4% and RMSE of 6.485, which is the higher correlation and maximum efficiency with less error compared to rest of the training functions. The study represents first attempt in assessing water quality using AI technology in Bhutan and the results showed a positive conclusion that the traditional means of experiments to check the quality of river water can be substituted with this reliable and realistic data driven water models. Article highlights Total dissolved solids (TDS), electrical conductivity (EC), potential of hydrogen (pH) and dissolved oxygen (DO) are selected as main water quality parameters as data for modeling. Artificial neural network model gives highest efficiency and accuracy compared to MLR and ANFIS model. Use of artificial intelligence shows better performance to provide water quality and future predictions over conventional methods leading to conservation of water resources and sustainability.","",https://doi.org/10.1007/s42452-022-05181-y,"",,
rayyan-224204481,"Ecology of Lake Erie - Nutrients, microbes, algae, and dreissenid mussels: A synthesis",,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"The Lake Erie ecosystem, including its physical, chemical, and biological components, has changed considerably during recent decades owing to human-induced environmental stress (Fraker et al., 2022; Makarewicz and Bertram, 1991; Munawar and Munawar, 1976; Sinclair et al., 2021). While much has been learned from monitoring and research activities, a full understanding of how and why the ecosystem has changed is lacking (Fraker et al., 2023; Fussell et al., 2016; Sterner et al., 2017; Scavia et al., 2023), which has hampered the development of management strategies that can help sustain the integrity of the lake and its valued ecosystem services (e.g. clean water, safe recreation, food production). This AEHM special issue is the first of four focused on Lake Erie, all of which will aim to display the science being conducted to enhance ecosystem understanding and guide management decision-making.This special issue centers on watershed, nutrient, microbial (including cyanobacteria), algal, and dreissenid mussel dynamics, including their causes and consequences. Specifically, it focuses on understanding factors that have driven changes in: 1) nutrient loading and in-lake nutrient dynamics; 2) algal and cyanobacteria dynamics; and 3) dreissenid growth, impacts, and spatial variation. After recapping each paper's major messages and management implications, we offer some concluding remarks.Since the early 2000s, Lake Erie has shown signs of intensified eutrophication, including increases in the extent and duration of hypoxia and harmful algal blooms dominated by cyanobacteria (hereafter, cyanoHABs; Scavia et al., 2014; Watson et al., 2016). Some of those symptoms have been linked to altered nutrient dynamics in Lake Erie's watersheds and, particularly, significant increases in dissolved reactive phosphorus loads (Baker et al., 2014; Stumpf et al., 2016). The source of most phosphorus entering Lake Erie is agriculture (Wilson et al., 2018); however, this source is dispersed across the landscape (Kast et al., 2021) and difficult to mitigate. Thus, delineating the characteristics of watersheds that export the largest amount of nutrients is important to identifying locations where nutrient reduction will be most effective. While reducing nutrient input is critical, the behavior of nutrients once they have entered the lake is likely to influence where and when cyanoHABs occur. Toward improving our understanding of eutrophication, two of this AEHM special issue's contributors focused on identifying causes of variation in the dynamics of nutrient loading and approaches to model the availability of these loads on chemicophysical conditions.Johnson et al. (2023) sought to identify how watershed characteristics have influenced nutrient and sediment inputs into western Lake Erie. To this end, these authors used a suite of physical attributes, land uses, and point-source contributions to characterize seven tributary watersheds, six of which are Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement Annex 4 priority watersheds, and five sub-watersheds. The authors then used principal components regression analysis to determine their relationship with nutrient and sediment yields into Lake Erie. Briefly, their results demonstrated spatial (regional) variation in contributions of nutrients and sediments from each river during 2017-2021 that was related to watershed attributes. For example, nutrient inputs into Lake Erie from watersheds were positively related to the percentage of land supporting cultivated crops and poorly drained soils, with higher slopes and lower amounts of pasture being positively correlated with sediment yields. These authors then discussed their findings in the context of impending nutrient reductions aimed at mitigation of Lake Erie's recent re-eutrophication (Baker et al., 2019), explaining how consideration of regional differences in nutrient and sediment yields could benefit nutrient management planning.While Johnson et al. centered on factors that influence nutrient and sediment loading into Lake Erie, Bocaniov et al. (2023) focused how nutrient (total phosphorus, TP) inputs affect within-lake TP movement and distribution. These authors used an updated phosphorus mass-balance model (2003-2016) to derive TP load-response relationships and response matrices to predict steady-state lake TP concentrations as a function of variable external TP inputs. A key finding is that inter-basin transfer of TP plays a large role in driving basin-specific TP concentrations (e.g. inflow from the central basin contributes ∼70% of the resident TP in the eastern basin). Bocaniov et al.'s modeling also demonstrated that western Lake Erie is likely to respond quickly (93 days) to reduced TP inputs, with longer response times estimated in the central and eastern basins (540 and 303 days, respectively). These authors then discuss how their findings can help guide where in the watershed to manage nutrients and what timeframes may be needed before agencies can expect to see impacts of nutrient abatement efforts.An outcome of excessive agricultural nutrient loading into aquatic ecosystems is enhanced primary production. Lake Erie has experienced increases in benthic algae (e.g. Cladophora), pelagic algae, and cyanobacteria during both past (1960s-1970s) and more recent eutrophication events (Munawar and Munawar, 1996; O'Donnell et al., 2023; Vollenweider et al., 1974; Watson et al., 2016). Lake Erie is a large and complex ecosystem, however, and the specific type or location of algal blooms cannot be predicted by nutrient loading alone. Rather, how and where blooms form will depend on complex processes such as gazing pressure and nutrient availability within the lake, as well as water warming that will interact with high nutrient availability. With this backdrop, four papers in this AEHM special issue sought to enhance our ability to understand and describe the dynamics of primary producers, including algae and cyanobacteria.To help better understand the mechanisms responsible for benthic Cladophora outbreaks in eastern Lake Erie since dreissenid mussels colonized the lake, Depew et al. (2023) quantified the enzymatically hydrolysable portion (EHP) of dissolved organic phosphorus (DOP). Samples were collected during May through September 2019 at varying depths along the north shore of the eastern basin. These authors found that the EHP substantially contributed to the dissolved P pool, with this contribution averaging 53% of the total dissolved P and 63% of the DOP concentration. Hence, a large amount of DOP appears bioavailable owing to enzymatic hydrolysis. This result, combined with the fact that bioavailable DOP concentrations often exceeded dissolved reactive P concentrations, indicates an increased role of the benthic contributions to P bioavailability in the eastern basin since the establishment of dreissenid mussels. In turn, Depew et al. highlight the need to consider EHP when designing management strategies to control Cladophora outbreaks in the eastern basin.In contrast to Depew et al., Hoffman et al. (2023) quantified seasonal nitrification in Lake Erie's water column and explored its potential role in driving microbial dynamics, including cyanoHABs dominated by Microcystis spp. To do so, these authors used the stable isotope, 15NH4+, to track nitrification and qPCR to determine the relative abundances of ammonia oxidizing organisms (i.e. bacteria and Archaea, AOO) during 2015-2017. Hoffman et al. found that nitrification rates were lower during cyanoHABs, suggesting that AOOs were not good competitors with cyanobacteria for ammonia. These low rates can in part explain why cyanoHABs dominated by Microcystis spp. (non-nitrogen fixers) can persist despite low bioavailable nitrogen (N). Further, the removal of bioavailable N via coupled nitrification-denitrification is lower than the increase in bioavailable N through regeneration and external N loading. Using these findings, Hoffman et al. discuss the importance of reducing N loading into Lake Erie as a means to help reduce seasonal cyanoHABs.Hounshell et al. (2023) also focused on understanding cyanoHAB dynamics, exploring the role of P as a driver instead of N. While total bioavailable P (TBP) loading from the Maumee River (Ohio, USA) during spring has been shown to be a strong predictor of cyanoHAB severity in western Lake Erie (Baker et al., 2014; Bertani et al., 2016; Stumpf et al., 2016), much unexplained variation in cyanoHAB severity remains. Thus, Hounshell et al. (2023) sought to identify environmental variables that could improve the predictive relationship between the Maumee River spring TBP load and cyanoHAB severity. Their modeling showed that at both low (< 273 MTA) and high (> 332 MTA) TBP loads levels, no other environmental factors improved predictive accuracy of cyanoHABs in western Lake Erie. However, during years with intermediate springtime TBP loads (273-332 MTA), predictions of cyanoHABs could be improved by considering winter and July TBP loads, as well as ice extent and phenology. While their work is still ongoing, Hounshell et al.'s research highlights the value of both tributary and in-lake monitoring, as well as process-based modeling to cyanoHAB forecasting.Wang et al. (2023) also sought to use modeling to predict the distribution of cyanoHABs in Lake Erie. Specifically, these authors compared the performance of the one-dimensional (1D) Aquatic Ecosystem Dynamics–General Lake Model (AED–GLM) and the three-dimensional (3D) Aquatic Ecosystem Model (AEM3D–iWQ) in predicting cyanoHABs, phytoplankton biomass (as measured by chlorophyll a), and associated physicochemical conditions (e.g. water temperature, nutrients), among other things, in western Lake Erie during 2008 and 2011-2014. By qualitatively comparing their results to in situ observations, Wang et al. showed that the 3D model better reproduced seasonal and spatial variation in nutrients and phytoplankton with less error than the 1D model. Conversely, cyanoHABs were better predicted by the 1D model. As detailed in their paper, Wang et al. explain how the scale at which these models are calibrated can drive differences in model performance. These authors also discuss the implications of their findings for choosing the appropriate model to support management endeavors, including how to best calibrate them to achieve desired goals.The final set of papers centered on invasive dreissenid mussels, which have become a ubiquitous part of the Great Lakes since their introduction nearly four decades ago (Nalepa et al., 2005). Owing to their potential to negatively impact native mussels (Schloesser et al., 2006), zooplankton communities (Johannsson et al., 2000), phytoplankton biomass (Bocaniov et al., 2014), and nutrient cycling (Hecky et al., 2004), Zebra (Dreissena polymorpha) and Quagga (D. rostiformis bugensis) Mussels have garnered the interest of researchers and management agencies alike. Much of this effort has been devoted to understanding the mechanisms that influence dreissenid demographics and impacts of the food web, which are the focus of the last set of papers in this AEHM special issue.To understand the growth dynamics of dreissenid mussels and their impact on phytoplankton in western Lake Erie, Carter et al. (2023) combined field surveys, in situ growth experiments, and laboratory excretion and grazing experiments. Their results, which are important in interpreting two of the remaining AEHM special issue papers, showed that dreissenid communities have lower clearance rates and excretion rates compared to previously reported rates. This understanding, combined with reduced dreissenid densities in Lake Erie during recent decades, led Carter et al. to conclude that the ability of dreissenids to compound the effect of eutrophication that causes cyanoHABs may be less than previously thought (e.g. Vanderploeg et al., 2009; but see Carrick et al., 2023 and Vanderploeg et al., 2023). Carter et al. (2023) acknowledge, however, that the impact of dreissenids could be locally high at times, owing to their patchy distribution across the basin. In turn, these authors stress the need for frequent, fine-scale benthic surveys, which could improve ability to understand and forecast the impacts of dreissenids on the ecosystem.Carrick et al. (2023) also sought to quantify the impact of dreissenid mussels on plankton assemblages (heterotrophs and phototrophs) in western Lake Erie. Using controlled experiments conducted monthly during May through October 2018, these authors show that dreissenids graze actively throughout the growing season, consuming nano-sized heterotrophic and phototrophic plankton (e.g. phototrophic cryptophytes, centric diatoms, and non-pigmented chrysomonads). By contrast, lower clearance rates of cyanobacteria (e.g. Microcystis spp.), dinoflagellates, and some colonial chlorophytes were observed. Carrick et al. further suggest that selective dreissenid grazing on ""non-harmful"" plankton species in the nanoplankton size range, combined with lower grazing rates on larger cyanobacteria and chlorophyte species, could contribute to western Lake Erie's cyanoHAB problem. Notably, the small-scale experimental results of Carrick et al. contrast those from Carter et al.'s (2023) field-based study. This discrepancy highlights the value of both experimental and field-based approaches, as well as the need to carefully consider the spatiotemporal context of the investigation, when to quantifying the role of dreissenid grazing as a secondary promoter (above nutrient loading) of cyanoHABs.Vanderploeg et al. (2023) also used an experimental approach to quantity the impacts of dreissenid mussel grazing on the phytoplankton community. Their experiments showed that grazing pressure on phytoplankton varied during May through October, with grazing on cryptophytes and diatoms being high during late May through early July. Despite cyanophytes dominating the phytoplankton beginning in late July, dreissenid grazing on them was non-existent or low. Interestingly, 16S rRNA gene-sequencing analyses showed a diverse cyanobacteria community with Planktothrix dominating during the spring and Cyanobium dominating most of the summer through fall. By contrast, Microcystis, which is largely thought to dominate cyanoHABs in Lake Erie, only dominated during late June. Further, Microcystis was preferentially rejected by Quagga Mussels relative to other cyanobacteria. Using these findings, Vanderploeg et al. draw a similar conclusion as Carrick et al. (2023) by suggesting that dreissenid grazing can favor specific cyanobacteria such as Microcystis. Importantly, however, the final effect of dreissenid grazing as a secondary promoter of cyanoHABS depends on the population density of dreissenids, which is currently low (Carter et al., 2023).In this special issue's final paper, Elgin et al. (2023) conducted an in situ study to quantify spatial variation in colonization potential, growth rates, and abundance of dreissenid mussels at two sites with contrasting water-column conditions in western Lake Erie. Despite finding comparable dreissenid colonization potential and growth between study sites, both on and in the experimental cages, Elgin et al. found fewer mussels in the surrounding sediment at the site nearer the Maumee River. These authors use this finding to conclude that water-column conditions appear to favor dreissenid settlement and growth on hard surfaces suspended above the substrate across the western basin, but that conditions on or near the substrate may inhibit mussel settling and growth. Elgin et al. eventually discuss how substrate-driven bottlenecks could inform our understanding of dreissenid recruitment and distribution, as well as nutrient dynamics, in western Lake Erie. These authors also suggest how better characterization of substrate conditions could support dreissenid control efforts.Owing to the impact of humans, the world's ecosystems have been experiencing dramatic change, which has threatened their structure, function, and dynamics, as well as their capacity to support services valued by society. The world's Great Lakes are no exception with these ecosystems being degraded by numerous anthropogenic stressors, including nutrient alteration (both eutrophication and oligotrophication), non-native species invasions, habitat destruction, and climate change, among many others (Allan et al., 2013; Jenny, 2020; Odada et al., 2003). The magnitude, multitude, and simultaneous nature of these stressors have in turn challenged both researchers seeking to understand the dynamics of these ecosystems and agencies charged with managing the valued natural resources (e.g. fish, wildlife) and other services (e.g. safe drinking water, recreational opportunities) that these ecosystems provide (Allan et al., 2013; Odada and Olago, 2006; Sterner et al., 2017). Such challenges highlight the need for continued research aimed at understanding the causes and consequences of anthropogenic change.While all the large lakes of the world have been altered by anthropogenic stress, Lake Erie is among the most degraded. Its susceptibility to anthropogenic stress is largely due to its small size, shallow depth, high connectivity via shipping, and large watershed that supports both large cities and agricultural production (Fraker et al, 2022; Ludsin et al., 2001; Reutter, 2019). Most relevant to this AEHM special issue, Lake Erie has shifted trophic states multiple times in response to human impacts and subsequent mitigation efforts. Prior to the 1950s, Lake Erie was primarily in a pre-industrial state of mesotrophy-oligotrophy and shifted to a state of hypertrophy-mesotrophy during the 1960s-1970s. During the 1980s-1990s, it shifted back to more mesotrophic conditions in response to both mitigation efforts designed to reduce point-source inputs of TP and the invasion of dreissenid mussels. Most recently (post 2000), Lake Erie returned to a more eutrophic state due to non-point source runoff of dissolved reactive phosphorus (Kane et al., 2014; Ludsin et al., 2001; Sinclair et al., 2023; Vollenweider et al., 1974). Concomitantly, Lake Erie has currently been experiencing increases in the magnitude and extent of both bottom hypoxia and cyanoHABs (Scavia et al., 2014; Watson et al., 2016), which are threatening: human health through cyanotoxin exposure (e.g. Francy et al., 2016; Wituszynski et al., 2017); fish populations and the fisheries that they support (e.g. Stone et al., 2020; Wolf et al., 2017); and the regional economy through effects on tourism and property values (Smith et al., 2019; Wolf et al., 2022). These threats have increased the need for the science necessary to make informed management decisions (Fraker et al., 2023; Fussell et al., 2016; Sterner et al., 2017; Scavia et al., 2023), which includes describing the current state of the Lake Erie ecosystem and understanding the causal mechanisms of recent ecosystem change.The contributions to this AEHM special issue have provided new insights into the drivers of nutrient inputs, in-lake nutrient concentrations, benthic algae (Cladophora), planktonic heterotrophs, microbial autotrophs (including cyanobacteria responsible for cyanoHABs), algae (e.g. diatoms, cryptophytes), and dreissenid mussels. Further, each study has provided information that could benefit management, whether it be ecological understanding that could support ecosystem modeling (e.g. quantifying dreissenid distributions and their impacts on grazing rates and nutrient excretion; Carter et al., 2023; Elgin et al., 2023) or tools that could support nutrient management decision-making (e.g. Bocaniov et al., 2023; Johnson et al, 2023), cyanoHAB severity (e.g. Carrick et al.,. 2023; Hounshell et al., 2023; Vanderploeg et al., 2023) or chemicophysical conditions, including algal and cyanobacteria biomass (e.g. Depew et al., 2023; Hoffman et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023). While many additional messages can be found in the papers, collectively, three key conclusions can be made. First, findings from each of the three focal areas of this AEHM special issue highlight the need to consider fine spatial and/or temporal scales in both the watershed and the lake proper. Doing so offers a means to fully appreciate the complex array of processes driving the dynamics of Lake Erie's chemicophysical conditions and lower food web (e.g. primary producers, dreissenid mussels). Second, while the papers in this special issue showed the value of field-, laboratory-, and modeling-based research to describing, understanding, or predicting ecosystem conditions, they also pointed to challenges that can arise when integrating findings. For example, discrepancies can arise owing to studies being conducted in different settings (e.g. in the laboratory vs. in the field) or at different spatiotemporal scales (e.g. see Carrick et al., 2023; Carter et al., 2023; Vanderploeg et al., 2023). Finally, most papers demonstrated the need for continued and intensified monitoring (e.g. broader coverage at finer spatial and temporal scales), which will challenge agencies responsible for tracking ecosystem conditions. We expect, however, that continued improvement in our ability to cost-effectively monitor Lake Erie and its watershed via remote sensing technologies (Yang et al., 2022; Yin et al., 2021), combined with continually improving data-analytic approaches (e.g. machine and deep learning; Sun and Scanlon, 2019), will help agencies meet this challenge.While the research described in this AEHM special issue has addressed many knowledge gaps, many more remain. Our hope is that continued reporting of findings as part of this AEHM Ecology of Lake Erie series will increase our ability to understand and model the structure, function, and dynamics of the ecosystem. Such understanding and tools should facilitate our continued movement towards ecosystem-based management in the Great Lakes, which could help agencies rehabilitate the lake and sustainably manage its valued resources in the face of continued anthropogenic stress.We thank Ken Minns for providing helpful feedback on a previous version of this synthesis.","",https://doi.org/10.14321/aehm.026.04.131,"",,
rayyan-224204570,A Convolutional Neural Network approach for downscaling climate model data in Trentino-South Tyrol (Eastern Italian Alps),,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Statistical downscaling is a very popular technique to increase the spatial resolution of existing global and regional climate model simulations and to provide reliable climate data at local scale. The availability of tailored information is particularly crucial for conducting local climate assessments, climate change studies and for running impact models, especially in complex terrain. A crucial requirement is the ability to reliably downscale the mean, variability and extremes of climate data, while preserving their spatial and temporal correlations.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Several machine learning-based approaches have been proposed so far to perform such task by extracting non-linear relationships between local-scale variables and large-scale atmospheric predictors and they could outperform more traditional statistical methods. In recent years, deep learning has gained particular interest in geoscientific studies and climate science as a promising tool to improve climate downscaling thanks to its greater ability to extract high-level features from large datasets using complex hierarchical architectures. However, the proper network architecture is highly dependent on the target variable, time and spatial resolution, as well as application purposes and target domain.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This contribution presents a Deep Convolutional Encoder-Decoder Network (DCEDN) architecture which was implemented and evaluated for the first time over Trentino-South Tyrol in the Eastern Italian Alps to derive 1-km climate fields of daily temperature and precipitation from ERA-5 reanalysis. We will show that in-depth optimization of hyper-parameters, loss function choice and sensitivity analyses are essential preliminary steps to derive an effective architecture and enhance the interpretability of results and of their variability. The validation of downscaled fields of both temperature and precipitation confirmed the improved representation of local features for both mean and extreme values, even though lower performances were obtained for precipitation in reproducing small-scale spatial features. In all cases, DCEDN was found to outperform classical schemes based on linear regression and the bias adjustment procedures used as benchmarks. We will discuss in detail the advantages and recommendations for the integration of DCEDN as an efficient post-processing block in climate data simulations supporting local-scale studies. The model constraints in feature extraction, especially for precipitation, over the limited extent of the study domain will also be explained along with potential future developments of such type of networks for improved climate science applications.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu22-10120,"",,
rayyan-224204579,Future Changes in High and Low Flows under the Impacts of Climate and Land Use Changes in the Jiulong River Basin of Southeast China,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Climate change and human activities have profoundly affected the world with extreme precipitation, heat waves, water scarcity, frequent floods and intense droughts. It is acknowledged that climate change will persist and perhaps intensify in the future, and it is thus meaningful to explore the quantitative impacts of these changes on hydrological regimes. The Jiulong River basin serves as an important watershed on the southeast coast of China. However, future hydrological changes under the combined impacts of climate change and land use change have been barely investigated. In this study, the climate outputs from five general circulation models (GCMs) under the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) were corrected and spatially downscaled by a statistical downscaling method combining quantile mapping and machine learning. The future high-resolution land use maps were projected by the CA–Markov model with land use changes from the Land-Use Harmonization 2 (LUH2) as constraints. The future dynamic vegetation process was projected by the Biome-GBC model, and then, the future hydrological process under four representative concentration pathways and shared socioeconomic pathways (RCP–SSP) combined scenarios was simulated by a distributed hydrological model. Based on the copula method, the flood frequency and corresponding return periods were derived. The results demonstrated that future precipitation and air temperature would continue to rise, and future land use changes would have different developing pathways determined by the designs in various SSP–RCPs. Under the combined impacts of climate and land use change, the total available water resources will increase due to increasing precipitation, and the high flow and low flow will both increase at three stations under the four SSP–RCPs. The annual 1-day maximum discharge is projected to increase by 67–133% in the last decade of the 21st century, and the annual 7-day minimum discharge is projected to increase by 19–39%. The flood frequency analysis showed that the Jiulong River basin would face more frequent floods in the future. By the end of the 21st century, the station-average frequency of a historical 100-year flood will increase by 122% under the most optimistic scenario (SSP126) and increase by 213% under the scenario of greatest regional rivalry (SSP370). We demonstrated that climate change would be the major cause for the increase in future high flows and that land use change would dominate future changes in low flows. Finally, we recommend integrated and sustainable water management systems to tackle future challenges in this coastal basin.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/atmos13020150,"",,

Low spatial representativeness limits gauge measurements of rainfall and low spatial resolution limits satellite-derived rainfall. SM2RAIN-based products, which exploit the inversion of the water balance equation to derive rainfall from soil moisture (SM) observations, can be an alternative. However, the quality of SM data limits the accuracy of rainfall. The goal of this work was to improve the accuracy of rainfall estimation through merging multiple soil moisture (SM) datasets. This study proposed an integration framework, which consists of multiple machine learning methods, to use satellite and ground-based soil moisture observations to derive a precipitation product. First, three machine learning (ML) methods (random forest (RF), long short-term memory (LSTM), and convolutional neural network (CNN)) were used, respectively to generate three SM datasets (RF-SM, LSTM-SM, and CNN-SM) by merging satellite (SMOS, SMAP, and ASCAT) and ground-based SM observations. Then, these SM datasets were merged using the Bayesian model averaging method and validated by wireless sensor network (WSN) observations. Finally, the merged SM data were used to produce a rainfall dataset (SM2R) using SM2RAIN. The SM2R dataset was validated using automatic meteorological station (AMS) rainfall observations recorded throughout the Upper Heihe River Basin (China) during 2014–2015 and compared with other rainfall datasets. Our results revealed that the quality of the SM2R data outperforms that of GPM-SM2RAIN, Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station data (CHIRPS), ERA5-Land (ERA5) and multi-source weighted-ensemble Precipitation (MSWEP). Triple-collocation analysis revealed that SM2R outperformed China Meteorological Data and the China Meteorological Forcing Dataset. Ultimately, the SM2R rainfall product was considered successful with acceptably low spatiotemporal errors (RMSE = 3.5 mm, R = 0.59, and bias = −1.6 mm).","",https://doi.org/10.3390/rs14215355,"",,

In particular, the SmartCampus, as an essential part of S&amp;CC, acquires a transverse protagonism. On the one hand, SmartCampuses are a realistic representation of more complex systems (i.e., intelligent cities or territories) where to deploy sensors and plan specific goals. Nevertheless, on the other hand, Smartcampuses allow the coexistence of different technologies and networks of experts that facilitate the development, testing, and evolution of technologies.

The physically based computational water quality models would require large spatial and temporal information databases of climatic, hydrologic, and environmental variables and solutions of nonlinear, partial differential equations at each grid point in a river basin. These models suffer from estimability, convergence, stability, approximation, dispersion, and consistency issues. In such a problematic modeling scenario, an artificial neural network (ANN) modeling of 22 stream water quality parameters (SWQPs) is performed from easily measurable data of precipitation, temperature, and novel land use parameters obtained from Geographic Information System (GIS) analysis for the Godavari River Basin, India. The ANN models are compared with the more traditional, statistical linear, and nonlinear regression models for accuracy and performance statistics. This study obtains regression coefficients of 0.93, 0.78, 0.83, and 0.74 for electrical conductivity, dissolved oxygen, biochemical oxygen demand, and nitrate in testing using feedforward ANNs compared with a maximum of 0.45 using linear and nonlinear regressions. Principal component analysis (PCA) is performed to reduce the input data dimension. The subsequent modeling using radial basis function and ANNs is found to improve the overall regression coefficients slightly for the chosen four water quality parameters (WQPs). A closed form equation for electrical conductivity has been derived from MATLAB simulations. The successful modeling results indicate the effectiveness and potential of ANNs over the statistical regression approaches for estimating the highly nonlinear problem of stream water quality distributions.","",https://doi.org/10.2166/h2oj.2022.019,"",,

First, the climate change impacts were analyzed with the Long Ashton Research Station Weather Generator (LARS-WG) downscaling approach by using General Circulation Models (GCMs) including the European Consortium Earth System Model (EC-EARTH), Hadley Centre Global Environment Model version 2 (HADGEM2), Model for Interdisciplinary Research on Climate, version 5 (MIROC5), and Max Planck Institute Earth System Model (MPI-ESM), from Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5 (CMIP5) under Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP4.5, RCP8.5) scenarios for 2021–2080. Afterward, the downscaled variables were utilized as inputs to the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model to predict future runoff under the climate change impact. Finally, the system dynamics (SD) model was employed to simulate various scenarios for assessing water balance utilizing the Vensim software. The results of downscaling models suggested that the temperature of the basin will increase by 0.47 and 0.91 °C under RCPs4.5 and 8.5 by 2040, respectively. Additionally, the precipitation will decrease by 3.5 percent under RCP4.5 and 14 percent under RCP8.5, respectively. Moreover, simulation results revealed that the water demand in various sectors will be enormously increased. The contribution of the climate change impact on the future run-off was a seven percent decrease, on average, over the basin. The SD model, according to presented plausible scenarios including decreasing agriculture product and shifting irrigation efficiency, cloud-seeding, population control, and household consumption reduction, reducing meat and animal-husbandry production, and groundwater consumption control, resulted in a water balance equilibrium over five years. However, the performance of individual scenarios was not effective; instead, a combination of several scenarios led to effective performance in managing reduced runoff under climate change.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/su14063376,"",,
rayyan-224204623,Impact of spatial distribution information of rainfall in runoff simulation using deep learning method,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract. Rainfall-runoff modeling is of great importance for flood forecast and water management. Hydrological modeling is the traditional and commonly used approach for rainfall-runoff modeling. In recent years, with the development of artificial intelligence technology, deep learning models, such as the long short-term memory (LSTM) model, are increasingly applied to rainfall-runoff modeling. However, current works do not consider the effect of rainfall spatial distribution information on the results. Focusing on 10 catchments from the Catchment Attributes and Meteorology for Large-Sample Studies (CAMELS) dataset, this study compared the performance of LSTM with different look-back windows (7, 15, 30, 180, 365 d) for future 1 d discharges and for future multi-day simulations (7, 15 d). Secondly, the differences between LSTMs as individual models trained independently in each catchment and LSTMs as regional models were also compared across 10 catchments. All models are driven by catchment mean rainfall data and spatially distributed rainfall data, respectively. The results demonstrate that regardless of whether LSTMs are trained independently in each catchment or trained as regional models, rainfall data with spatial information improves the performance of LSTMs compared to models driven by mean rainfall data. The LSTM as a regional model did not obtain better results than LSTM as an individual model in our study. However, we found that using spatially distributed rainfall data can reduce the difference between LSTM as a regional model and LSTM as an individual model. In summary, (a) adding information about the spatial distribution of the data is another way to improve the performance of LSTM where long-term rainfall records are absent, and (b) understanding and utilizing the spatial distribution information can help improve the performance of deep learning models in runoff simulations.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-2387-2022,"",,

In this study, a deep neural network and a long short-term memory model were applied for water level predictions between 2000 and 2020 in the Phan Rang River Basin of Nihn Thuan located in Vietnam. In addition, a complex network model was utilized to improve the predictive ability of both models for water level prediction at the outlet point of the basin. The water level prediction by each model was compared with the observed water level data, and the predictive power for each model was evaluated using three statistical metrics: the correlation coefficient (CC), the Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (NSE), and the normalized root-mean-squared error (NRMSE). Using all data from nearby stations, there may be distortions in the prediction due to unnecessary data for model learning. Therefore, the complex network method was applied to find best data sources providing factors contributing to water level behaviors. The results of this study showed that a combination of the long short-term memory model and the complex network provided the best predictive performance (CC: 0.99; NSE: 0.99; and NRMSE: 0.17) and was selected as the optimal model for water level prediction in this study. As the need for disaster management is gradually increasing, it is expected that the deep learning model with the complex network method have sufficient potential to reduce the damage from natural disasters and improve disaster response systems, such as in the outskirts of Vietnam.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/w14030466,"",,

This study explores machine learning, particularly deep-learning techniques in developing computer emulators for a commonly used process model, the Delta Simulation Model II (DSM2), used for salinity estimation in California’s Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta (Delta). We apply historical daily input data to DSM2 and corresponding salinity simulations at 28 study locations from 1990 to 2019 to train two machine-learning models: a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and Long-Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks in a multi-task learning framework. We assess sensitivity of both networks to the amount of antecedent input information (memory) and training data to determine appropriate memory size and training data length. We evaluate network performance according to several statistical metrics as well as visual inspection. The study further investigates two additional networks, the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) and Residual Network (ResNet) in salinity modeling, and compares their efficacy against MLP and LSTM. Our results demonstrate strong performance of the four neural network models over the study period, achieving absolute bias below 4%, plus near-perfect correlation coefficients and Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency coefficients. The high complexity LSTM shows slight performance edge. We further show that deeper and wider versions of MLP and LSTM yield only marginal benefit over their baseline counterparts. We also examined issues related to potential overfitting by the proposed models, training data selection strategies, and analytical and practical implications. Overall, this new study indicates that machine-learning-based emulators can efficiently emulate DSM2 in salinity simulation. They exhibit strong potential to supplement DSM2 in salinity modeling and help guide water resource planning and management practices for the Delta region.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/w14132030,"",,

First, the second-generation Canadian earth system model (CanESM2) was adopted to predict future climate conditions. The Statistical DownScaling Model (SDSM) was then applied to downscale the generated data. To analyze the water quality of the river, concentrations of dissolved oxygen (DO) and total dissolved solids (TDSs) from the river were collected. Using the collected climate and hydrometric data, the ANNs were trained to simulate (i) the ratio of snowfall-to-total precipitation based on the temperature, (ii) the river flow rate based on the temperature and precipitation; and (iii) DO and TDS concentrations based on the river flow and temperature. Finally, the generated climate change data were used as inputs to the ANN model to investigate the climate change impacts on the river flow as well as DO and TDS concentrations within the selected region. Hydrologic alteration of the river was evaluated via the Range of Variability Approach (RVA) under historical and climate change scenarios. The results under climate change scenarios were compared with those under historical scenarios and indicated that climate change would lead to a heterogeneous change in precipitation and temperature patterns. These changes would have serious degrading impacts on the river discharge as well as DO and TDS concentration levels, causing deterioration in the sustainability of the river system and ecological health of the region.","",https://doi.org/10.2166/wcc.2022.106,"",,

Climate change and rapid urbanization contribute to the occurrence of natural disasters. In addition, their destructive impact has been altered, posing significant challenges to the efficiency, equity, and sustainability of water resources allocation and management. Uncertainty estimation in hydrology is essential for water resources management. By quantifying the associated uncertainty of reliable hydrological forecasting, an efficient water resources management plan is obtained. Moreover, reliable forecasting provides significant future information to assist risk assessment. Currently, the majority of hydrological forecasts utilize deterministic approaches. Nevertheless, deterministic forecasting models cannot account for the intrinsic uncertainty of forecasted values. Using the Bayesian deep learning approach, this study developed a probabilistic forecasting model that covers the pertinent subproblem of univariate time series models for multi-step ahead daily streamflow forecasting to quantify epistemic and aleatory uncertainty. The new model implements Bayesian sampling in the Long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network by using variational inference to approximate the posterior distribution. The proposed method is verified with three case studies in the USA and three forecasting horizons. LSTM as a point forecasting neural network model and three probabilistic forecasting models, such as LSTM-BNN, BNN, and LSTM with Monte Carlo (MC) dropout (LSTM-MC), were applied for comparison with the proposed model. The results show that the proposed Bayesian long short-term memory (BLSTM) outperforms the other models in terms of forecasting reliability, sharpness, and overall performance. The results reveal that all probabilistic forecasting models outperformed the deterministic model with a lower RMSE value. Furthermore, the uncertainty estimation results show that BLSTM can handle data with higher variation and peak, particularly for long-term multi-step ahead streamflow forecasting, compared to other models.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/w14223672,"",,

Accurate and reliable groundwater level (GWL) prediction is crucial for groundwater resources management and land subsidence risk assessment. In this study, a representative deep learning model, long short-term memory (LSTM), is adopted to predict groundwater level with the selected predictors by partial mutual information (PMI), and bootstrap is employed to generate different samples combination for training many LSTM models, and the predicted values by many LSTM models are used for the uncertainty assessment of groundwater level prediction. Two wells of different climate zones in the USA were used as a case study. Different significant predictors of GWL for two wells were identified by PMI from candidate predictors incorporating teleconnection patterns information. The results show that GWL is significantly affected by antecedent GWL, AO, Niño 3.4, Niño 1 + 2, and precipitation in humid areas, and by antecedent GWL, AO, Niño 3.4, Niño 3, Niño 1 + 2, and PNA in arid areas. Predictor selection can assist in improving the prediction performance of the LSTM model. The relationship between GWL and significant predictors were modeled by the LSTM model, and it achieved higher accuracy in humid areas, while the performance in arid areas was poorer due to limited precipitation information. The performance of LSTM was improved by increasing correlation coefficient (R2) values by 10% and 25% for 2 wells compared to generalized regression neural network (GRNN). Three uncertainty evaluation metrics indicate that LSTM reduced the uncertainty compared to GRNN model.

Therefore, anticipating their occurrence and understanding the main factors related to CyanoHABs are critical to improve decision-making processes and water resource management. In this context, we present two modelling options for the analysis and prediction of cyanoHABs in two drinking water reservoirs from Spain. This case represents a unique opportunity to combine efforts from different academic disciplines (i.e., aquatic ecology and data science), environmental companies, and public water managers to address this increasingly severe issue. Susqueda (Ter basin, Catalonia) is a eutrophic, large and deep reservoir (Zmax = 110 m) where monitoring efforts in recent years have focused on a monthly measurement in more than 30 physico-chemical, hydrological, meteorological and biological parameters, some of them involving expert intervention and costly efforts that could not be held at a higher temporary frequency. Cuerda del Pozo (Duero basin, Castilla y León) is a deep reservoir (Zmax = 30 m) where monitoring efforts have focused on daily data collection through probes mounted in automatic profilers. This strategy allowed a higher monitoring frequency for fewer parameters and a narrower time span. In both cases, the parameter chosen as a proxy of cyanobacterial proliferation (output of models) is fluorometric measurements of chlorophyll-a and phycocyanin. The results of our machine-learning-based analyses suggest that the selected modelling path mainly depends on two aspects: (1) the time span where data are collected, and (2) the frequency and type of data measured (i.e., one discrete measurement at the surface vs. many measurements along the water column). Thus, a Susqueda dataset analysis led to more interpretative results, allowing for a better understanding of the system and the main factors related to CyanoHABs with limited predictive capacity. Meanwhile, the Cuerda del Pozo dataset is treated as a time series where autoregressive forecasting techniques, combined with information of exogenous parameters, are applied to foresee cyanobacterial blooms before they occur, losing part of the interpretability in the process. The results from this work are expected to provide an effective tool to boost smart and goal-orientated sampling planning, while improving data-driven decision-making processes essential for the water management of cyanobacterial blooms.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/blsf2022014038,"",,

The major goal of this study was to evaluate the applicability of uninterrupted monthly GRACE-derived terrestrial water storage (TWSGRACE) records in facilitating detection of long- and short-term hydroclimatic events affecting the GWS in a coastal area. The TWSGRACE data gap was filled with reconstructed values from multi-linear regression (MLR) and artificial neural network (ANN) models and used to estimate changes in GWS in the Texas coastal region (Gulf Coast and Carrizo–Wilcox Aquifers) between 2002 and 2019.

Reservoirs play a key role in many human societies due to their capability to manage water resources. In addition to their role in water supply and hydropower production, their ability to retain water and control the flow makes them a valuable asset for flood mitigation. This is a key function since extreme events have increased in the last decades as a result of climate change, and therefore, the application of mechanisms capable of mitigating flood damage will be key in the coming decades. Having a good estimation of the outflow of a reservoir can be an advantage for water management or early warning systems. When historical data are available, data-driven models have been proven a useful tool for different hydrological applications. In this sense, this study analyses the efficiency of different machine learning techniques to predict reservoir outflow, namely multivariate linear regression (MLR) and three artificial neural networks: multilayer perceptron (MLP), nonlinear autoregressive exogenous (NARX) and long short-term memory (LSTM). These techniques were applied to forecast the outflow of eight water reservoirs of different characteristics located in the Miño River (northwest of Spain). In general, the results obtained showed that the proposed models provided a good estimation of the outflow of the reservoirs, improving the results obtained with classical approaches such as to consider reservoir outflow equal to that of the previous day. Among the different machine learning techniques analyzed, the NARX approach was the option that provided the best estimations on average.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-2022-171,"",,

This study investigates the performance of dynamic artificial neural network (ANN) models in prediction of water inflow into the Sefidruod dam reservoir (Iran). For this purpose, first, the discharge time series of tributaries of the Sefidruod dam are analyzed for trends for a 47 year time period (1345-1392) using parametric regression and non-parametric Mann-Kendall tests considering independence, short-term, and long-term persistence assumptions. Also, the homogeneity of the data is investigated using three statistical tests including Cumulative Deviations, Worsley's Likelihood Ratio, and Bayesian inference. Then, the inflow discharges into the reservoir of Sefidruod dam from GhezelOzan and Shahroud tributaries are simulated using dynamic Nonlinear Auto-Regressive (NAR) and Nonlinear Auto-Regressive with exogenous input (NARX) models. Further, water inflow values of both rivers are predicted for the next 5 years in future using dynamic NAR and NARX models. Finally, the obtained results are investigated using trend analysis approach. Obtained results show a significant decreasing trend in both rivers. Results also show a continuous downward trend for the following 5-year period predicted by NAR and NARX models. In addition, it was found that the results obtained by the NARX model are less accurate compared to those by the NAR model.","",https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1028907/v1,"",,

The ET 0 calculated by the Penman-Monteith - FAO method requires several input data. However, in the Minas Gerais region, the meteorological data are limited. The aim of this study was to evaluate the performance of Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) to estimate the monthly mean ET 0 with different input data combinations and scenarios. Three scenarios were evaluated: at the state level, where all climatological stations were used (Scenario I - SI) ; and at regional level, where the Minas Gerais state was divided according to the climatic classification of Thornthwaite (Scenario II - SII) and by Köppen (Scenario III - SIII). ANN and RF performed better in ET 0 estimating among the models evaluated in the SI, SII and SIII scenarios with the following data combination: i) latitude, longitude, altitude, month, mean, maximum and minimum temperature, and relative humidity; and ii) latitude, longitude, altitude, month, mean temperature, and relative humidity. Also, the SVM and MLR models are recommended for all scenarios in situations with limited climatic data, where only air temperature and relative humidity data are available. Although dividing into scenarios results in less input data for models training, SII and SIII showed a slightly better result in the southern areas of the Minas Gerais state.","",https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-2002124/v1,"",,
rayyan-224204926,Hybrid forecasting: using statistics and machine learning to integrate predictions from dynamical models,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract. Hybrid hydroclimatic forecasting systems employ data-driven (statistical or machine learning) methods to harness and integrate a broad variety of predictions from dynamical, physics-based models – such as numerical weather prediction, climate, land, hydrology and Earth system models – into a final prediction product. They are recognised as a promising way of enhancing prediction skill of meteorological and hydroclimatic variables and events, including rainfall, temperature, streamflow, floods, droughts, tropical cyclones, or atmospheric rivers. Hybrid forecasting methods are now receiving growing attention due to advances in weather and climate prediction systems at sub-seasonal to decadal scales, a better appreciation of the strengths of machine learning, plus expanding access to computational resources and methods. Such systems are attractive because they may avoid the need to run a computationally-expensive offline land model, can minimize the effect of biases that exist within dynamical outputs without explicit bias correction and downscaling, benefit from the strengths of machine learning models, and can learn from large datasets, while combining different sources of predictability with varying time-horizons. Here we review recent developments in hybrid hydroclimatic forecasting and outline key challenges and opportunities. These include obtaining physically-explainable results, assimilating human influences from novel data sources, integrating new ensemble techniques to improve predictive skill, creating seamless prediction schemes that merge short to long lead times, incorporating modelled initial land surface and ocean/ice conditions, acknowledging spatial variability in landscape and atmospheric forcing, and increasing the operational uptake of hybrid prediction schemes.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-2022-334,"",,
rayyan-224204928,Coupling agricultural system models with machine learning to facilitate regional predictions of management practices and crop production,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract Process-based agricultural system models are a major tool for assessing climate-agriculture-management interactions. However, their application across large scales is limited by computational cost, model uncertainty, and data availability, hindering policy-making for sustainable agricultural production at the scale meaningful for land management by farmers. Using the Agricultural Production System sIMulator (APSIM) as an example model, the APSIM model was run for 101 years from 1980 to 2080 in a typical cropping region (i.e., the Huang-Huai-Hai plain) of China. Then, machine learning (ML)-based models were trained to emulate the performance of the APSIM model and used to map crop production and soil carbon (which is a key indicator of soil health and quality) dynamics under a great number of nitrogen and water management scenarios. We found that ML-based emulators can accurately and quickly reproduce APSIM predictions of crop yield and soil carbon dynamics across the region under different spatial resolutions, and capture main processes driving APSIM predictions with much less input data. In addition, the emulators can be easily and quickly applied to identify optimal nitrogen management to achieve yield potential and sequester soil carbon across the region. The approach can be used for modelling other complex systems and amplifying the usage of agricultural system models for guiding agricultural management strategies and policy-making to address global environmental challenges from agriculture intensification.","",https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/ac9c71,"",,
rayyan-224204950,Submarine Cables as Precursors of Persistent Systems for Large Scale Oceans Monitoring and Autonomous Underwater Vehicles Operation,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Long-term and reliable marine ecosystems monitoring is essential to address current environmental issues, including climate change and biodiversity threats. The existing oceans monitoring systems show clear data gaps, particularly when considering characteristics such as depth coverage or measured variables in deep and open seas. Over the last decades, the number of fixed and mobile platforms for in situ ocean data acquisition has increased significantly, covering all oceans' regions. However, these are largely dependent on satellite communications for data transmission, as well as on research cruises or opportunistic ship surveys, generally presenting a lag between data acquisition and availability. In this context, the creation of a widely distributed network of SMART cables (Science Monitoring And Reliable Telecommunications) - sensors attached to submarine telecommunication cables - appears as a promising solution to fill in the current ocean data gaps and ensure unprecedented oceans health continuous monitoring. The K2D (Knowledge and Data from the Deep to Space) project proposes the development of a persistent oceans monitoring network based on the use of telecommunications cables and Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs). The approach proposed includes several modules for navigation, communication and energy management, that enable the cost-effective gathering of extensive oceans data. These include physical, chemical, and biological variables, both registered with bottom fixed stations and AUVs operating in the water column. The data that can be gathered have multiple potential applications, including oceans health continuous monitoring and the enhancement of existing ocean models. The latter, in combination with geoinformatics and Artificial Intelligence, can create a continuum from the deep sea to near space, by integrating underwater remote sensing and satellite information to describe Earth systems in a holistic manner.","",https://doi.org/10.1109/oceans47191.2022.9977360,"",,

To this end, the datasets used are composed of daily records of flow and rainfall stations between 2010 to 2013, made available by the National Water Agency (ANA) and the INEA (Environment State Institute of Rio de Janeiro) Flood Alert System.The adopted methodology investigates the influence of the input variables and ANN architecture on the models' performance.The results obtained were considered very satisfactory and support the proposition of the potential of Artificial Neural Networks for hydrological forecasting. It was found that of the 189 models created, 42.3 \% had the coefficient of determination R2 above 0.80.Conclusions, The best ANN developed received daily data from six rainfall stations and one fluviometric station, obtaining for metrics R2 and MAE the values of 0.88, 7.03 cm, respectively.Finally, the results were compared with related works and are similar or superior even with shorter time series.","",https://doi.org/10.5335/rbca.v14i1.12964,"",,

Europe has seen what could be the most severe drought conditions to hit the continent for more than 500 years [1], with exceptionally low water levels impacting navigation of inland waterways and leaving insufficient cooling water for power plants. French fire fighters struggled with wildfires on a dramatic scale. The Yangtze River in China reached historically low levels. In the Western USA, the drought has broken previous records for the driest 22-year period in the region since the year 800 CE [2], depriving farmers of water and further impacting fragile ecosystems in the Colorado River basin. Examining these various manifestations of drought reveals a series of interlinked phenomena that are examined in this themed issue of the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society.First, it is clear that droughts are profoundly human-influenced, and we expect them to be even more so in the future. The title of this themed issue—Drought risk in the Anthropocene—reflects the recognition that the Earth System is human-influenced to an extent that we are said to be living in a new geological era [3]. Droughts are a manifestation of the Anthropocene in a number of different senses. As the paper by Vicente-Serano et al. (Global drought trends and future projections) [4] explains, greenhouse gas emissions are driving some of the conditions that are making droughts more severe. Human influences both warm the planet and intensify contrasts between wet and dry conditions, and drought has been impacted particularly by increased evaporation linked to warming. Human influences may also be implicated in circulation changes that are shifting the patterns of meteorological drought conditions. Marvel et al. (Using machine learning to identify novel hydroclimate states) [5] use a new combination of empirical data and machine learning methods to identify the increasing frequency of drought conditions in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries.Besides anthropogenic climatic changes, human activity has impacted the Earth's surface and catchments through land use change, urbanization and infrastructure construction. These changes have modified the ways in which meteorological droughts propagate into hydrological droughts. The expansion of irrigated agriculture and water use in cities and industries means that human water withdrawals are often the most significant drivers of water scarcity. Since the introduction of the concept of planetary boundaries by Rockström et al. in [6], there has been debate about whether human exploitation of fresh water is now so voluminous that a planetary boundary for water has already been exceeded. Pastor et al. (Understanding the transgression of global and regional freshwater planetary boundaries) [7] continue their investigation of this question, by examining water stress at regional as well as global scales.Second, the processes by which droughts materialize are extraordinarily complex. They vary enormously across space. Readers will obtain insights into the complexity of local processes by reading the basin-scale and regional analyses in this themed issue, including Mishra et al.'s article (Benchmark worst droughts during the summer monsoon in India) [8], which examines the severity of monsoon droughts, and Quentin Grafton et al.'s article (Resilience to Anthropogenic Drought in the Northern Murray-Darling Basin, Australia) [9], which adds to the important literature on the complex hydrology and contested water use in the Murray–Darling Basin. The paper by Murgatroyd et al. (Strategic analysis of the drought resilience of water supply systems) [10] illustrates the complexity of how meteorological droughts translate into hydrological droughts and water shortages for people. The interactions are influenced above all by human water management: storage, transfers and the allocation of water to different users. These papers illustrate the role of basin-scale and national-scale studies in understanding the complexity of droughts. Though there have been very impressive steps in global hydrology and water resource systems modelling over the last two decades, it has far from replaced the insights that can be gained from more local-scale studies that can mobilize much more data to expose the complexity of hydrological processes.Finally, droughts have multiple impacts and those impacts are profoundly modified by adaptation responses. Quentin Grafton et al.'s article examines the response of birds in the Murray-Darling Basin, which adds to ongoing debates in the literature on the ecological impacts of droughts. Ecosystems are naturally resilient to droughts, but when they are already degraded because of other anthropogenic impacts, extreme droughts may push ecosystems into a state from which they cannot recover—more research is required to establish under what conditions that hypothesis is true. This emphasizes the point that climate change needs to be viewed in the context of multiple stressors on the environment.Barbier's [11] review article on the economics of managing water crises examines the economic impacts of droughts and argues that misallocation of water is a consequence of inadequate pricing of scarce water resources. Few economists would argue with that assertion, though they may also point to the very rare instances of functioning water markets and question why the governance conditions to create such markets are so elusive.This themed issue documents important scientific advances that are improving understandings of droughts and the evidence needed for drought management. There have been rapid advances in drought forecasting, which are documented in the paper by AghaKouchak et al. (Status and prospects for drought forecasting: opportunities in artificial intelligence and hybrid physical-statistical forecasting) [12]. These advances have been enabled by a combination of new data sources, in particular from satellite Earth observation, and increasingly powerful methods to analyse these vast datasets, notably with machine learning (also employed by Marvel et al. [5] for analysis of climate data) and artificial intelligence. AghaKouchak et al. [12] demonstrate how physical insights can help to constrain and improve the performance of data-based methods. Increasing computational resources are enabling climatic, hydrological and water resource systems modelling on scales that were hitherto considered to be infeasible—for example the paper by Murgatroyd et al. [10] applies water resource system simulation modelling, driven by more than 9000 years of synthetic daily climate data to analyse water supply shortages on an unprecedented national scale. The paper by Goodwin et al. (The contribution of a catchment-scale advice network to successful agricultural drought adaptation in Northern Thailand) [13] reports on lessons learnt from social network analysis, applied to data gathered from an extensive on-the-ground survey of farmers, in guiding ways forward for improved adaptation to foster improved agricultural drought resilience in the region.As one would expect from the Chief Executive of England's Environment Agency (which has responsibility for regulating the water environment and drought planning), Sir James Bevan's concluding article (Drought risk in the Anthropocene: from the jaws of death to the waters of life) [14] focuses upon what can and should be done to manage drought risk. The article follows the speech by Sir James in 2019, which used the 'jaws of death' analogy to draw attention to the combined effects on future water shortages of increasing demand for water and climate-driven water scarcity. In his article for this themed issue, Sir James points out opportunities for a more drought-resilient future, which may be achieved through reductions in water consumption, strategic augmentations of supply and reallocating more water to the aquatic environment to build its resilience to climate-related shocks. Such an approach will need to be underpinned by a better scientific understanding of the causes and management of droughts, which this themed issue seeks to provide.Data accessibilityThis article has no additional data.Authors' contributionsJ.W.H.: writing—original draft; J.H.: writing—review and editing; G.H.: writing—review and editing.All authors gave final approval for publication and agreed to be held accountable for the work performed therein.Conflict of interest declarationThis theme issue was put together by the Guest Editor team under supervision from the journal's Editorial staff, following the Royal Society's ethical codes and best-practice guidelines.

rayyan-224205006,County-Level Irrigation Water Demand Estimation Using Machine Learning: Case Study of California,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Irrigated agriculture is the largest consumer of freshwater globally. Despite the clarity of influential factors and deriving forces, estimation of the volumetric irrigation demand using biophysical models is prohibitively difficult. Data-driven models have proven their ability to predict geophysical and hydrological phenomena with only a handful of influential input variables; however, the lack of reliable input data in most agricultural regions of the world hinders the effectiveness of these approaches. Attempting to estimate the irrigation water demand, we first analyze the correlation of potential influencing variables with irrigation water. We develop machine learning models to predict California’s annual, county-level irrigation water demand based on the statistical analysis findings over an 18-year time span. Input variables are different combinations of deriving meteorological forces, geographical characteristics, cropped area, and crop category. After testing various regression machine learning approaches, the result shows that Gaussian process regression produces the best results. Our findings suggest that irrigated cropped area, air temperature, and vapor pressure deficit are the most significant variables in predicting irrigation water demand. This research also shows that Gaussian process regression can predict irrigation water demand with high accuracy (R2 higher than 0.97 and RMSE as low as 0.06 km3) with different input variable combinations. An accurate estimation of irrigation water use of various crop categories and areas can assist decision-making processes and improve water management strategies. The proposed model can help water policy makers evaluate climatological and agricultural scenarios and hence be used as a decision support tool for agricultural water management at a regional scale.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/w14121937,"",,

Haditha Dam is one of the major projects on the Euphrates River in Iraq that is used for flood control and water management. The area downstream of the dam contains many strategic agricultural and industrial projects that are highly affected by the variation in the river water level. In this study, a neural network model (ANN) was created to forecast the levels of the Euphrates downstream of Haditha Dam. The model was trained in MATLAB with four inputs representing water levels at present and previous times. The data was utilized for training a daily model for 496 days and a monthly model for 241 months. The results indicated that ANN can estimate water level (t+1) with a high degree of accuracy. Furthermore, the results provide that the ANN is an effective technique to predict daily and monthly water levels and that the empirical equation can be used to compute daily and monthly levels with a regression coefficient greater than 92 percent for (training, validation, testing, and all data) for the daily model and greater than 84 percent for the monthly model.

rayyan-224205013,Novel Salinity Modeling Using Deep Learning for the Sacramento–San Joaquin Delta of California,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Water resources management in estuarine environments for water supply and environmental protection typically requires estimates of salinity for various flow and operational conditions. This study develops and applies two novel deep learning (DL) models, a residual long short-term memory (Res-LSTM) network, and a residual gated recurrent unit (Res-GRU) model, in estimating the spatial and temporal variations of salinity. Four other machine learning (ML) models, previously developed and reported, consisting of multi-layer perceptron (MLP), residual network (ResNet), LSTM, and GRU are utilized as the baseline models to benchmark the performance of the two novel models. All six models are applied at 23 study locations in the Sacramento–San Joaquin Delta (Delta), the hub of California’s water supply system. Model input features include observed or calculated tidal stage (water level), flow and salinity at model upstream boundaries, salinity control gate operations, crop consumptive use, and pumping for the period of 2001–2019. Meanwhile, field observations of salinity at the study locations during the same period are also utilized for the development of the predictive use of the models. Results indicate that the proposed DL models generally outperform the baseline models in simulating and predicting salinity on both daily and hourly scales at the study locations. The absolute bias is generally less than 5%. The correlation coefficients and Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency values are close to 1. Particularly, Res-LSTM has slightly superior performance over Res-GRU. Moreover, the study investigates the overfitting issues of both the DL and baseline models. The investigation indicates that overfitting is not notable. Finally, the study compares the performance of Res-LSTM against that of an operational process-based salinity model. It is shown Res-LSTM outperforms the process-based model consistently across all study locations. Overall, the study demonstrates the feasibility of DL-based models in supplementing the existing operational models in providing accurate and real-time estimates of salinity to inform water management decision making.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/w14223628,"",,
rayyan-224205055,Stream Temperature Predictions for River Basin Management in the Pacific Northwest and Mid-Atlantic Regions Using Machine Learning,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Stream temperature (Ts) is an important water quality parameter that affects ecosystem health and human water use for beneficial purposes. Accurate Ts predictions at different spatial and temporal scales can inform water management decisions that account for the effects of changing climate and extreme events. In particular, widespread predictions of Ts in unmonitored stream reaches can enable decision makers to be responsive to changes caused by unforeseen disturbances. In this study, we demonstrate the use of classical machine learning (ML) models, support vector regression and gradient boosted trees (XGBoost), for monthly Ts predictions in 78 pristine and human-impacted catchments of the Mid-Atlantic and Pacific Northwest hydrologic regions spanning different geologies, climate, and land use. The ML models were trained using long-term monitoring data from 1980–2020 for three scenarios: (1) temporal predictions at a single site, (2) temporal predictions for multiple sites within a region, and (3) spatiotemporal predictions in unmonitored basins (PUB). In the first two scenarios, the ML models predicted Ts with median root mean squared errors (RMSE) of 0.69–0.84 °C and 0.92–1.02 °C across different model types for the temporal predictions at single and multiple sites respectively. For the PUB scenario, we used a bootstrap aggregation approach using models trained with different subsets of data, for which an ensemble XGBoost implementation outperformed all other modeling configurations (median RMSE 0.62 °C).The ML models improved median monthly Ts estimates compared to baseline statistical multi-linear regression models by 15–48% depending on the site and scenario. Air temperature was found to be the primary driver of monthly Ts for all sites, with secondary influence of month of the year (seasonality) and solar radiation, while discharge was a significant predictor at only 10 sites. The predictive performance of the ML models was robust to configuration changes in model setup and inputs, but was influenced by the distance to the nearest dam with RMSE &lt;1 °C at sites situated greater than 16 and 44 km from a dam for the temporal single site and regional scenarios, and over 1.4 km from a dam for the PUB scenario. Our results show that classical ML models with solely meteorological inputs can be used for spatial and temporal predictions of monthly Ts in pristine and managed basins with reasonable (&lt;1 °C) accuracy for most locations.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/w14071032,"",,

Despite its importance and finite availability, local‐scale monitoring of groundwater withdrawals required for sustainable water management practices is not carried out in most countries, including the United States. In this study, we combine publicly available datasets into a machine learning framework for estimating groundwater withdrawals over the state of Arizona. Here we include evapotranspiration, precipitation, crop coefficients, land use, annual discharge, well density, and watershed stress metrics for our predictions. We employ random forests to predict groundwater withdrawals from 2002 to 2020 at a 2 km spatial resolution using in situ groundwater withdrawal data available for Arizona Active Management Areas (AMA) and Irrigation Non‐Expansion Areas (INA) from 2002 to 2009 for training and 2010–2020 for validating the model respectively. The results show high training () and good testing () scores with normalized mean absolute error (NMAE) ≈ 0.62 and normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) ≈ 2.34 for the AMA/INA region. Using this method, we spatially extrapolate the existing groundwater withdrawal estimates to the entire state and observe the co‐occurrence of both groundwater withdrawals and land subsidence in South‐Central and Southern Arizona. Our model predicts groundwater withdrawals in regions where production wells are present on agricultural lands and subsidence is observed from Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR), but withdrawals are not monitored. By performing a comparative analysis over these regions using the predicted groundwater withdrawals and InSAR‐based land subsidence estimates, we observe a varying degree of subsidence for similar volumes of withdrawals in different basins. The performance of our model on validation datasets and its favourable comparison with independent water use proxies such as InSAR demonstrate the effectiveness and extensibility of our combined remote sensing and machine learning‐based approach.","",https://doi.org/10.1002/hyp.14757,"",,
rayyan-224205088,Prediction of Future Lake Water Availability Using SWAT and Support Vector Regression (SVR),,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Lakes are major surface water resource in semi-arid regions, providing water for agriculture and domestic use. Prediction of future water availability in lakes of semi-arid regions is important as they are highly sensitive to climate variability. This study is to examine the water level fluctuations in Pakhal Lake, Telangana, India using a combination of a process-based hydrological model and machine learning technique under climate change scenarios. Pakhal is an artificial lake built to meet the irrigation requirements of the region. Predictions of lake level can help with effective planning and management of water resources. In this study, an integrated approach is adopted to predict future water level fluctuations in Pakhal Lake in response to potential climate change. This study makes use of the NASA Earth Exchange Global Daily Downscaled Projections (NEX-GDDP) dataset which contains 21 Global Climate Models (GCMs) at a resolution of 0.25 × 0.25° is used for the study. The Reliability Ensemble Averaging (REA) method is applied to the 21 models to create an ensemble model. The hydrological model outputs from Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) are used to develop the machine-learning based Support Vector Regression (ν-SVR) model for predicting future water levels in Pakhal Lake. The scores of the three metrics, correlation coefficient (R2), RMSE and MEA are 0.79, 0.018 m, and 0.13 m, respectively for the training period. The values for the validation periods are 0.72, 0.6, and 0.25 m, indicating that the model captures the observed lake water level trends satisfactorily. The SWAT simulation results showed a decrease in surface runoff in the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) 4.5 scenario and an increase in the RCP 8.5 scenario. Further, the results from ν-SVR model for the future time period indicate a decrease in future lake levels during crop growth seasons. This study aids in planning of necessary water management options for Pakhal Lake under climate change scenarios. With limited observed datasets, this study can be easily extended to the other lake systems.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/su14126974,"",,
rayyan-224205217,Reliability of Gridded Precipitation Products for Water Management Studies: The Case of the Ankavia River Basin in Madagascar,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Hydrological modeling for water management in large watersheds requires accurate spatially-distributed rainfall time series. In case of low coverage density of ground-based measurements, gridded precipitation products (GPPs) from merged satellite-/gauge-/model-based rainfall products constitute an attractive alternative. The quality of which must, nevertheless, be verified. The objective of this study was to evaluate, at different time scales, the reliability of 6 GPPs against a 2-year record from a network of 14 rainfall gauges located in the Ankavia catchment (Madagascar). The GPPs considered in this study are the African Rainfall Estimate Climatology (ARC2), the Climate Hazards Group Infrared Precipitation with Station data (CHIRPS), the European Centre Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ECMWF Reanalysis on global land surface (ERA5-Land), the Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for Global Precipitation Measurement V06 Final (IMERG), the Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks Cloud Classification System (PERSIANN-CCS), and the African Rainfall Estimation (RFEv2) products. The results suggest that IMERG (R2 = 0.63, slope of linear regression a = 0.96, root mean square error RMSE = 12 mm/day, mean absolute error MAE = 5.5 mm/day) outperforms other GPPs at the daily scale, followed by RFEv2 (R2 = 0.41, a = 0.94, RMSE = 15 mm/day, MAE = 6 mm/day) and ARC2 (R2 = 0.30, a = 0.88, RMSE = 16 mm/day, MAE = 6.7 mm/day). All GPPs, with the exception of the ERA5, overestimate the ‘no rain’ class (0–0.2 mm/day). ARC2, IMERG, PERSIANN, and RFEv2 all underestimate rainfall occurrence in the 0.2–150 mm/day rainfall range, whilst CHIRPS and ERA5 overestimate it. Only CHIRPS and PERSIANN could estimate extreme rainfall (&gt;150 mm/day) satisfactorily. According to the Critical Success Index (CSI) categorical statistical measure, IMERG performs quite well in detecting rain events in the range of 2–100 mm/day, whereas PERSIANN outperforms IMERG for rain events larger than 150 mm/day. Because it performs best at daily scale, only IMERG was evaluated for time scales other than daily. At the yearly and monthly time scales, the performance is good with R2 = 0.97 and 0.87, respectively. At the event time scale, the probability distribution function PDF of rain gauge values and IMERG data show good agreement. However, at an hourly time scale, the correlation between ground-based measurements and IMERG data becomes poor (R2 = 0.20). Overall, the IMERG product can be regarded as the most reliable gridded precipitation source at monthly, daily, and event time scales for hydrological applications in the study area, but the poor agreement at hourly time scale and the inability to detect extreme rainfall &gt;100 mm/day may, nevertheless, restrict its use.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/rs14163940,"",,

Implementing a smart irrigation system using IoT devices has various advantages but also presents some problems. The purpose of the study was to create a smart irrigation system that uses IoT sensors and machine learning algorithms to optimize water usage in small-scale farms, decreasing waste while increasing crop output. The suggested system uses IoT sensors to monitor soil moisture and meteorological conditions, with data processed in real time via edge computing.

This study introduces a method to support the design of groundwater quality monitoring networks through machine learning spatial predictions. Several supervised classification algorithms were trained to identify spatially distributed variables explaining the presence of nitrates in the groundwater of various aquifers in central Spain, including the Madrid Tertiary Detrital Aquifer. The dataset comprised over 240 nitrate concentration measurements and 20 explanatory variables related to geology, climatic factors, and pressures such as agricultural land, urban areas or intensive farming location. Subsequently, the algorithms with the best predictive capability were used to map nitrate contamination in order to locate unmonitored sites where contamination is likely to occur. Ensemble tree-based classifiers, such as random forests or gradient boosting, showed the most accurate predictions of groundwater contamination, with area under the curve scores around 0.8. The map-based output of this approach facilitates identifying new areas of interest requiring observation points. This method provides an alternative to expert-based criteria for locating new groundwater monitoring stations and is easily transferable to other environments.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu24-10066,"",,
rayyan-224205380,Neural Network Driven Early Warning System for Groundwater Flooding: A Comprehensive Approach in Lowland Karst Areas,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Enhancing flood prediction is imperative given the profound socio-economic impacts of flooding and the projected increase in its frequency due to the impacts of climate change. In this context, artificial intelligence (AI) models have emerged as valuable tools, offering enhanced accuracy and cost-effective solutions to simulate physical flood processes. This study addresses the development of an early warning system for groundwater flooding in the lowland karst area of south Galway, Ireland, employing neural network models with Bayesian regularization and scaled conjugate gradient training algorithms. The lowland karst area is characterised by several groundwater fed, intermittent lakes, known as turloughs that fill when the underlying karst system becomes surcharged during periods of high rainfall. The training datasets incorporate several years of field data from the study area and outputs from a highly calibrated semi-distributed hydraulic/hydrological model of the karst network. Inputs for training the models include flood volume data from the past 5 days, rainfall data, and tidal amplitude data over the preceding 4 days. Both daily and hourly models were developed to facilitate real-time flood predictions. Results indicate strong performance by both Bayesian and Scaled Conjugate Gradient models in real-time flood forecasting. The Bayesian model shows forecasting capabilities extending up to 45 days into the future, with a Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) of 1.00 up to 7 days ahead and 0.95 for predictions up to 45 days ahead. The Scaled Conjugate Gradient model offers the best performance up to 60 days into the future with NSE of 0.98 up to 20 days ahead and 0.95 for predictions up to 60 days ahead, coupled with the advantage of significantly reduced training time compared to the Bayesian model. Additionally, both models exhibit a Co-efficient of Correlation (r) value of 0.98 up to 60 days ahead. Evaluation measures such as Kling Gupta Efficiency reveal high performance, with values of 0.96 up to 15 days ahead for both Bayesian and Scaled Conjugate Gradient models, and 0.90 up to 45 days ahead in the future. The integration of diverse data sources and consideration of both daily and hourly models enhance the resilience and reliability of such an early warning system. In particular, the Scaled Conjugate Gradient model emerges as a versatile tool. It balances predictive accuracy with reduced computational demands, thereby offering practical insights for real-time flood prediction, and aiding in proactive flood management and response efforts.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu24-13138,"",,
rayyan-224205402,Decadal trends in groundwater quality observed in national groundwater monitoring wells - assessment of climate change effects using machine learning.,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"As pressures on water resources are expected to increase due to climate change and population growth, ensuring sufficient quantity and quality of drinking water emerges as a global challenge. Climate change can affect groundwater quantity and quality through changes in chemical equilibria, reaction kinetics, and soil processes induced by shifting temperature, precipitation, and evapotranspiration. However, the impact of climate change on groundwater quality has not been studied thoroughly and thus is identified as an important scientific challenge and knowledge gap. To address this challenge, we analyzed high-quality long-term datasets, spanning from 1993 to 2022 of several environmental and hydroclimatic factors, as well as groundwater quality and quantity, available at national scale in Denmark. Initial results from around 200 groundwater monitoring wells distributed across Denmark show a decrease in pH and oxygen content in most of the wells for the period 1993-2022. Expected results will show the temporal change of selected geogenic compounds and other major chemicals and physical properties and their trends for this climatic period. Machine learning analysis will be applied in future work to identify the main drivers of change in concentrations of selected geogenic compounds, oxygen, and pH, and to create baseline maps of the recent period (2017-2022/23). The baseline maps, representing current conditions, will be derived by geospatial machine learning modelling frameworks linking covariate maps with borehole scale information of water quality parameters. How to distinguish the impacts of climate change from human-induced changes such as pumping, as well as link observed trends in the past, current baseline maps, and expected future hydroclimatic changes to investigate groundwater quality patterns under future conditions still needs to be studied. As some geogenic compounds are harmful to human health and the environment, decrease drinking water quality and increase purification costs, a better understanding of the linkages between climate change and groundwater chemistry will be vital for future groundwater management in Denmark. The developed machine learning model and its potential for global upscaling could contribute to sustainable groundwater management worldwide.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu24-16289,"",,
rayyan-224205415,Biodiversity Assessment in Drylands Using Augmented Satellite Imagery Through Deep Learning Models,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"As global biodiversity faces increasing threats from climate change, habitat loss, and human activities, effective methods for assessing and monitoring biodiversity are crucial. Drylands are particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, and integrating remote sensing technology with ecological research can help protect these environments. Identification of individual trees and shrubs is fundamental to assess biodiversity and can also improve carbon stocks estimates. However, identifying individual trees using medium resolution satellite images is often not feasible. The use of advanced technologies, such as machine learning and satellite imagery in environmental management plays a key role in biodiversity conservation and can potentially fill this gap. The use of readily available Maxar satellite imagery makes conservation approaches accessible and cost-effective, which is crucial for widespread adoption, especially in resource-limited settings or for large-scale studies. This study aims to improve the identification of vegetation in dryland ecosystems by integrating deep learning methods to remote sensing. The primary objective was to distinguish vegetation from rocks or shadows in these areas, which is often challenging due to the dark appearance of vegetation and the similar visual features of the landscape, such as landforms textures, water bodies or man-made objects.. To address this challenge, a Vision Transformer (ViT) deep learning model was developed to estimate near infrared (NIR) spectral bands from high resolution Maxar Satellite images. By enhancing the spectral richness, the model aids in the differentiation of vegetation. Maxar satellite imagery was primarily used because of its accessibility through Google services, making it ideal for planning initial surveys to identify areas of interest for more detailed study. The accuracy of the model was validated against high-resolution SkySat NIR imagery, and achieved an R2 of 0.92. The obtained NIR band helped to clearly distinguish vegetation from non-vegetative surfaces such as soil, rocks, and water, which were not as discernible in RGB imagery alone. The use of a deep learning method to estimate a synthetic NIR band proved to be cost-effective and efficient for large-scale identification of individual trees and shrubs in drylands, overcoming the limitations of medium-resolution satellite imagery. The findings of the study are crucial to the conservation of biodiversity and offer a practical approach for environmentalists and researchers. Future work includes expanding the dataset to include various dryland environments, and integrating additional data sources such as soil data and topographic features for a more comprehensive analysis.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu24-20836,"",,

In modern era of high technology, artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things have an important role to play in decision‐making approaches. According to hydro‐agrological studies, an accurate assessment of evapotranspiration is necessary for irrigation control, and to have an in‐depth understanding of the environmental factor interactions, a sensitivity analysis should be carried out. One of the tools, alongside empirical equations, is artificial intelligence for time‐series prediction. Thus, we compared several models for Penman–Monteith ET 0 estimation to see which one performs better in the arid area of Morocco using meteorological data from the region of Fes. They were evaluated according to the MSE, RMSE, MAE, MAPE, and R 2 and the variance of error distribution to show the performances of linear regression, K‐Nearest Neighbor, decision tree, random forest, support vector regression, long short‐term memory, and artificial neural network. According to the findings, LSTM outperformed the models with satisfactory results and an accuracy rate of 99.82%. An underlying mechanism of sensitivity analysis was also introduced to find the contribution of each element and estimate the target with a limited dataset. The findings show satisfactory results of R 2 = 98.97%. The distribution and reliability of the prediction were proven using the Taylor diagram and Kruskal–Wallis test for the effectiveness of the study.

Real-time flood forecasting is crucial for early warning systems and disaster risk reduction. However, traditional forecasting methods often have limitations in terms of accuracy and timeliness. This paper, developed under the framework of AI4Copernicus 5th Calls project, presents a data-driven approach for real-time flood and water level forecasting using AI and machine learning algorithms. The proposed system is based on a hybrid model that combines multiple machine learning algorithms, including DLinear/NLinear, LSTM Hindsight Modelling, and FLEX. The system is trained on historical data on hydrological and meteorological features, and is able to predict water levels at river gauging stations up to the next 9 hours. The system has been tested on data from the Lamone River in Italy, and has been shown to achieve a mean-absolute-error of only a few (&lt;5) centimetres. This is a very low error margin for this kind of river, and is comparable to or better than the performance of other alternative forecast approaches. The system has been integrated into GECOSistema's Flood Risk Intelligence platform, named SaferPlaces (www.saferplaces.co). This platform provides a user-friendly interface for accessing flood risk information, and includes features such as real-time flood maps, early warning alerts, and detailed flood risk assessments.

rayyan-224205576,A framework tool for conceptualizing integrated water resources for sustainable water management,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract As the pressures on water resources are ever increasing, the organization of complex disparate data and scientific information to inform the actions to protect and enhance the resilience of freshwater resources is key for sustainable development and implementation of integrated water resource management (IWRM). Methodologies supporting IWRM implementation have largely focused on water management and governance, with less attention to evaluation methods of ecologic, economic, and social conditions. To assist in assessing water resource sustainability, the Integrated Hydro‐Environment Assessment Tool (IHEAT) has been developed to create a framework for different disciplines and interests to engage in structured dialogue. The IHEAT builds on the considerable body of knowledge developed around IWRM and seeks to place this information into a single framework that facilitates the cogeneration of knowledge between managers, stakeholders, and the communities affected by management decisions with the understanding that there is a need to merge expert analysis with traditional knowledge and the lived experience of communities. IHEAT merges the driver‐pressure‐state‐impact‐response (DPSIR) framework, the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment's ecosystem services and human well‐being (HWB) framework, sustainability criteria for water resource systems, and water resources indexes and sets of indicators to better understand spatiotemporal interactions between hydrologic, socioeconomic, and ecologic systems and evaluate impacts of disturbances on ecological goods and services and HWB. IHEAT consists of a Conceptual Template (IHEAT‐CT) which provides a systematic framework for assessing basin conditions and guiding indicator selection as well as an Assessment Interface (IHEAT‐AI) for organizing, processing, and assessing analytical results. The IHEAT‐CT, presented herein, is a rapid screening tool that connects water use directly, or through ecosystem goods and services (EGS), to constituents of HWB. Disturbance Templates for eight pressure types, such as land‐use change, climate change, and population growth, are provided to guide practitioners regarding potential changes to landscape elements in the hydrological cycle, impacts on EGS, and societal implications on HWB. The basin screening results in a summary report card illuminating key freshwater ecosystems, the EGS they provide, and potential responses to drivers and pressures acting on the hydrologic system. This screening provides a common understanding by technical and nontechnical parties and provides the foundation for more complex conceptual models should they be required. An indicator list guides the selection of hydrologic, ecologic, economic, and social analytical methods to support IWRM technical input.","",https://doi.org/10.1002/rvr2.14,"",,
rayyan-224205586,Towards a Deep Learning-based Spatio-temporal Fusion Approach for Accurately Improving Snow Cover Mapping: A Case Study in the Moroccan Atlas Mountains with Performance Evaluation,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Remote sensing technologies provide continuous and detailed observations of various land surface parameters, including snow cover, vegetation, land surface temperature, soil moisture, and evapotranspiration, offering invaluable information at various scales and contexts. One of the major uses is the precise mapping and monitoring of seasonal snow cover dynamics, which are essential for water management and global water balance modeling. Since an intelligent ecosystem based on accurate snow cover estimation requires a collection of high-resolution satellite images, both temporally and spatially, to capture snow dynamics, particularly in semi-arid areas where snowfall is extremely variable. These requirements can be difficult to achieve based on a single sensor, mainly due to the trade-offs between the temporal, spectral, and spatial resolutions of the available satellites. In addition, atmospheric conditions and cloud contamination can increase the number of missing satellite observations. However, there is a promising solution to these limitations. Exploiting the complementary capabilities of the new-generation multispectral sensors aboard Landsat-8 (L8) and Sentinel-2 (S2), with spatial resolutions ranging from 10 to 30 meters, offers an unprecedented opportunity to significantly advance the accuracy of snow cover mapping. Hence, this study aims to investigate the effectiveness of the combined use of optical sensors through deep learning-based spatiotemporal image fusion to capture snow dynamics and produce detailed and dense Normalized Snow Difference Index (NDSI) time series in a semi-arid context. Three distinct deep learning models, namely Very Deep Super Resolution (VDSR), Super Resolution Unet (SR-Unet), and Residual Convolutional Neural Network (RCNN), were evaluated and compared to fuse L8 and S2 data. The findings indicate that all three approaches can provide accurate estimates for a coarse-resolution image at a given fusion date, although there are notable disparities in prediction quality between the different approaches. Specifically, R-squared values were measured at 0.94, 0.92, and 0.96 for RCNN, SR-Unet, and VDSR, respectively, with corresponding root mean square error (RMSE) values of 0.09, 0.11, and 0.08. Our results suggest that the VDSR model is particularly effective in producing high-resolution merged snow time series and can compensate for the absence of ground snow cover data.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu24-13030,"",,
rayyan-224205595,Modeling reservoir surface temperatures for regional and global climate models: a multi-model study on the inflow and level variation effects,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract. The complexity of the state-of-the-art climate models requires high computational resources and imposes rather simplified parameterization of inland waters. The effect of lakes and reservoirs on the local and regional climate is commonly parameterized in regional or global climate modeling as a function of surface water temperature estimated by atmosphere-coupled one-dimensional lake models. The latter typically neglect one of the major transport mechanisms specific to artificial reservoirs: heat and mass advection due to inflows and outflows. Incorporation of these essentially two-dimensional processes into lake parameterizations requires a trade-off between computational efficiency and physical soundness, which is addressed in this study. We evaluated the performance of the two most used lake parameterization schemes and a machine-learning approach on high-resolution historical water temperature records from 24 reservoirs. Simulations were also performed at both variable and constant water level to explore the thermal structure differences between lakes and reservoirs. Our results highlight the need to include anthropogenic inflow and outflow controls in regional and global climate models. Our findings also highlight the efficiency of the machine-learning approach, which may overperform process-based physical models in both accuracy and computational requirements if applied to reservoirs with long-term observations available. Overall, results suggest that the combined use of process-based physical models and machine-learning models will considerably improve the modeling of air–lake heat and moisture fluxes. A relationship between mean water retention times and the importance of inflows and outflows is established: reservoirs with a retention time shorter than ∼ 100 d, if simulated without inflow and outflow effects, tend to exhibit a statistically significant deviation in the computed surface temperatures regardless of their morphological characteristics.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-15-173-2022,"",,

We developed a modeling approach for seasonal streamflow forecasts using a machine learning technique, random forest (RF), for runoff season flows (April 1–July 31 total) at the important gauge of Lees Ferry, Arizona, on the CRB. The model predictors include antecedent basin conditions, large-scale climate teleconnections, climate model projections of temperature and precipitation, and the mean ESP forecast from CBRFC. The RF model is fitted and validated separately for lead times spanning 0 to 18 months over the period 1983–2017. The performance of the RF model forecasts and CBRFC ESP forecasts are separately assessed against observed streamflows in a cross validation mode. Forecast performance was evaluated using metrics including relative bias, root mean square error, ranked probability skill score, and reliability. Measured by ranked probability skill score, RF outperforms a climatological benchmark at all lead times and outperforms CBRFC's ESP hindcasts for lead times spanning 6 to 18 months. For the 6- to 18-month lead times, the RF ensemble median had a root mean square error that was between ∼410- and ∼620-thousand acre-feet lower than that of the ESP ensemble median (i.e., RF reduced ensemble median RMSE by −9% to −12% relative to ESP). Reliability was comparable between RF and ESP. More skillful long-lead cross-validated forecasts using machine learning methods show promise for their use in real time forecasts and better informed and efficient water resources management; however, further testing in various decision models is needed to examine RF forecasts' downstream impacts on key water resources metrics like robustness, reliability, and vulnerability.","",https://doi.org/10.1061/jwrmd5.wreng-6167,"",,
rayyan-224205707,Reliability of Satellite-Based Rainfall Products for Water Management Studies: the Case of The Ankavia River Basin in Madagascar,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Hydrological modeling for water management in large watersheds requires accurate spatially-distributed rainfall time series. In case of low coverage density of ground-based measurements, satellite precipitation products (SPP) constitute an attractive alternative, the quality of which must nevertheless be verified. The objective of this study was to evaluate, at different time scales, the reliability of six SPPs against a 2-year record from a network of 14 rainfall gauges located in the Ankavia catchment (Madagascar). The SPPs considered in this study are the African Rainfall Estimate Climatology (ARC2), the Climate Hazards group Infrared Precipitation with Station data (CHIRPS), the ECMWF Reanalysis (ERA5), the Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for Global Precipitation Measurement (IMERG), the Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks (PERSIANN), and the African Rainfall Estimation (REF2) products. The results suggest that IMERG (R&amp;sup2; = 0.63, slope of linear regression a = 0.96, root mean square error RMSE = 12 mm/day, mean absolute error MAE = 5.5 mm/day) outperforms other SPPs at the daily scale, followed by REF2 (R&amp;sup2; = 0.41, a = 0.94, RMSE = 15 mm/day, MAE = 6 mm/day) and ARC2 (R&amp;sup2; = 0.30, a = 0.88, RMSE = 16 mm/day, MAE = 6.7 mm/day). All SPPs, with the exception of the ERA5, overestimate the &amp;lsquo;no rain&amp;rsquo; class (0 &amp;ndash; 0.2 mm/day). ARC2, IMERG, PERSIANN, and REF2 all underestimate rainfall occurrence in the 0.2 &amp;ndash; 150 mm/day rainfall range, whilst CHIRPS and ERA5 overestimate it. Only CHIRPS and PERSIANN could estimate extreme rainfall (&amp;gt;150 mm/day) satisfactorily. According to the Critical Success Index (CSI) categorical statistical measure, IMERG performs quite well in detecting rain events in the range 2-150 mm/day, whereas PERSIANN outperforms IMERG for rain events larger than 150 mm/day. Because it performs best at daily scale, only IMERG was evaluated for time scales other than daily. At the yearly and monthly time scales, the performance is good with R&amp;sup2; = 0.97 and 0.87, respectively. At the event time scale, the probability distribution function PDF of rain gauge values and IMERG data show good agreement. However, at hourly time scale, the correlation between ground-based measurements and IMERG data becomes poor (R&amp;sup2; = 0.20). Overall, the IMERG product can be regarded as the most reliable satellite precipitation source at monthly, daily and event time scales for hydrological applications in the study area, but the poor agreement at hourly time scale and the inability to detect extreme rainfall &amp;gt;200 mm/day may nevertheless restrict its use.","",https://doi.org/10.20944/preprints202207.0146.v2,"",,

These trends pose serious threats to the agricultural sector, directly impacting food production and security. Moreover, increasing drought incidence increases the risks associated with agricultural and forestry disasters, including reduced crop yields, soil degradation, and wildfires. Given these challenges, the ability to accurately monitor and predict drought conditions is critical. Effective drought forecasting plays an important role in establishing agricultural and water management policies and enabling better handling of the impacts of these events. This will enable timely and informed decisions to ensure that appropriate measures are in place to mitigate the adverse impacts of drought on ecosystems, food supplies and overall environmental health. The development and improvement of tools for drought time series forecasting is therefore essential to ongoing efforts to adapt to and mitigate the impacts of climate change. This study introduces a model designed to predict Vegetation Health Index (VHI) time series data using the Predictive Recurrent Neural Network Version 2 (PredRNN-V2). The VHI, which effectively integrates land surface temperature and vegetation status, has been widely used in drought assessment. The study focuses on South Korea, utilizing long-term weekly VHI data from NOAA for short-term prediction. The PredRNN-V2 model utilizes a network of interconnected spatio-temporal LSTM cells to learn and predict the temporal and spatial characteristics of time series images. This architecture can properly handle the complex spatial and temporal dynamics inherent in satellite-based drought data and can therefore be an effective tool for drought prediction.

rayyan-224205784,Application of Machine Learning Technique for Rainfall-Runoff Modelling of Highly Dynamic Watersheds,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Nowadays, great attention has been attributed to the study of runoff and its fluctuation over space and time. There is a crucial need for a good soil and water management system to overcome the challenges of water scarcity and other natural adverse events like floods and landslides, among others. Rainfall-runoff modeling is an appropriate approach for runoff prediction, making it possible to take preventive measures to avoid damage caused by natural hazards such as floods. In the present study, several data driven models, namely: Multiple linear regression (MLR), Multiple adaptive regression splines (MARS), Support vector machine (SVM), and Random Forest (RF), were used for rainfall-runoff prediction of the Gola watershed, located in the south-eastern part of the Uttarakhand. The performance of the models was evaluated based on the coefficient of determination (R2), root mean square error (RMSE), Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), and percent bias (PBAIS) indices. In addition to the numerical comparison, the models were evaluated and their performances were evaluated base on graphical plotting, i.e., line diagram, scatter plot, Violin plot, relative error plot and Taylor diagram (TD). The comparison results revealed that the four heuristic methods gave higher accuracy than the MLR model. Among the machine learning models, the RF (RMSE (m3/s), R2, NSE, and PBIAS (%) = 6.31, 0.96, 0.94, and -0.20 during the training period, respectively, and 5.53, 0.95, 0.92, and -0.20 during the testing period, respectively) surpassed the MARS, SVM, and the MLR models in forecasting daily runoff for all cases studies. Among all four models, the RF model outperformed in the training and testing periods. It can be summarized that the RF model is best-in-class and delivers a strong potential for runoff prediction of the Gola watershed.","",https://doi.org/10.20944/preprints202206.0163.v1,"",,

Here, we employ high-resolution land surface modeling, advanced satellite observations, global climate model data, and deep learning to estimate GWS changes in the past and future. We find a 3.51&amp;#177;2.40 Gt yr-1 increase in GWS from 2002&amp;#8211;2018, especially in exorheic basins, attributed to glacier melting. The GWS will persistently increase in the future, but the growth rate is slowing down (0.14 Gt yr-1 for 2079&amp;#8211;2100). Increasing GWS is projected over most endorheic basins, which is associated with increasing precipitation and decreasing shortwave radiation. In contrast, decreasing GWS is projected over the headwaters of Amu Darya, Yangtze, and Yellow river basins. These insights have implications for sustainable water resource management in a changing climate.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu24-2331,"",,
rayyan-224205877,"Novel Machine Learning Approaches for Predicting Soil Moisture Content Using Hydrological and Soil Characteristics: A Comparative Analysis of ANN, SVM, and ANFIS Models",,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"<title>Abstract</title> The agricultural system's ability to make decisions on water management and irrigation scheduling depends on knowledge of the soil moisture content. However, when used with large datasets, standard techniques for estimating soil moisture content, like time-domain reflectometry and gravimetric analysis, need a significant amount of time and manual labor. The moisture content of soil is significantly influenced by numerous critical hydrological and soil parameters. As a result, these characteristics can be used to calculate and predict the soil moisture content. This work offers an alternative machine learning (ML) method for modeling and predicting moisture content of soil based on hydrological and soil characteristics. To predict the moisture content of soil from various hydrological and soil properties, such as average water depth (feet), average soil bulk density (g/cm<sup>3</sup>), average organic matter (%), Cation-Exchange capacity (meq/100g), percentages of clay and sand content (%), and tonnage of residuals (ton/acre), three machine learning techniques were employed: artificial neural network (ANN), and support vector machine (SVM) and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) were employed for the prediction of the soil moisture content. The findings demonstrated that all three methods (ANN, SVM, and ANFIS) could accurately predict moisture content, with different prediction error rates. The average prediction error (APE) of ANN, SVM, and ANFIS is 9.057%, 10.834%, and 5.753%, respectively, of which the lowest root mean square error (RMSE) was observed for ANFIS of the testing (0.9979) and training (1.0049) datasets. In nutshell, the created models may be used to forecast the moisture in the soil of any farms with given hydrological and soil characteristics to control the water management system, saving money, effort and scarce water resources in the process of figuring out the soil moisture content.","",https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-5404605/v1,"",,

rayyan-224205966,Towards a comprehensive optical workflow for monitoring and estimation of water levels and discharge in watercourses,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Coping with natural disasters such as floods places special demands on the emergency units. From the point of view of command-and-control operators, observations of watercourses are desirable in the event of flooding in order to obtain an accurate picture of the situation. Optical measurement methods using cameras offer thereby advantages as they do not require water contact and hence can be used safely. Therefore, the project ""KIWA: Artificial Intelligence (AI) for Flood Warning"" (http://kiwa.hydro.tu-dresden.de/) is developing AI-based tools for the robust quantification of water levels, flow velocities and flow rates from surveillance cameras. In this article, we present the workflow for an exclusive optical measurement of time series of water level and discharge from single images and short video sequences. The basis is a high-precision (i.e., at centimetre level), georeferenced 3D terrain model of the measurement site including the riverbed. The terrain model is created using the structure-from-motion (SfM) technique and georeferenced via ground control points (GCPs) measured with a multiband GNSS receiver. To determine the water level, the water area in the single images is automatically segmented using AI based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and then intersected with the terrain model. Changes of the camera geometry influence the measurement accuracy during long-term observations. Therefore, the GCPs are automatically detected in the individual images with an adapted AI-based keypoint detector to frequently update the estimated camera orientation. To estimate the discharge, the water surface flow velocity is determined using short video sequences and applying the particle tracking (PTV) method, whereby the segmented water area narrows down the search area for the particle detection. Afterwards, the ""OptiQ"" modelling approach is used to derive the discharge times series based on the PTV measurements. Thereby, data filtering and error correction methods are used to achieve continuous time series.&amp;#160; The methods were developed at three different measuring gauges, whose cameras record single images and videos every 15 minutes over several months. The accuracy of the water level measurement is in the centimetre range, even at night with the support of infrared emitters. Depending on the water level, there are deviations in the flow rate, which average less than 10%.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu24-12507,"",,
rayyan-224205967,An exploration of using large language models to integrate farmer behaviour into an agricultural systems model of the Peruvian Andes,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"The implications of climate change on agro-pastoral farming systems in the Peruvian Andes are not fully understood. There is already a significant impact on agricultural productivity from current climate variability and extreme weather in the region. This is exacerbated by chronic poverty in many rural areas and the need for improved government-led strategic planning. Tools to assist with policy planning for climate change adaptations that achieve environmental and social resilience are vital, and these require collaboration with rural communities to incorporate the complexities of behavioural responses to climate change, market dynamics, and policy shifts in agricultural and water management.&amp;#160; In this study we further develop a recent agricultural systems model (the TELLUS model; Pilditch et al., in review). The model is an agent-based simulation focussed on the behaviour of interacting populations of individual farming agents. TELLUS offers the opportunity to analyse the impact of interventions/policies in light of key scenarios and conditions of interest, with potential to uncover unforeseen emergent behaviours within farming systems (e.g., tipping points, amplifiers, system adaptations) and potential unintended consequences of scenarios and policies (e.g., increasing in equalities; increased system fragility). A difficulty in applying such models to specific case studies is in choosing valid parameter values, especially for model behaviour associated with human behaviour and decision-making. Our work over recent years includes extensive fieldwork in the Cordillera Negra and Cordillera Blanca, involving interviews and workshops with farming communities, and collaboration with regional NGOs. These interactions have been instrumental in understanding local challenges and priorities. The challenge in terms of modelling this system is turning information gained from qualitative methods (e.g. interviews) into parameter values for the model. Our novel approach is to assess the extent to which modern AI systems, specifically, Large Language Models (LLMs) can help perform this task. &amp;#160;We leverage the reasoning abilities of LLMs to directly estimate relevant model parameters from automated interview transcription/translations. We will discuss the extent to which this integration has aided the creation of a TELLUS model tuned specifically to the Peruvian Andes context. Our approach will hopefully serve as a novel tool, combining empirical research, community involvement, and advanced computational modelling, to explore future climate scenarios and the potential effects of policy interventions.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu24-18078,"",,

Notably, rural inhabitants in both rich and low-income countries are becoming increasingly concerned about the quality of their water. Even while artificial intelligence (AI) can help with the majority of environmental sustainability issues, including water management, machine learning models can maximize water resource conservation. There is a large knowledge gap regarding the application of AI to water pollution mitigation. Long-term performance under ideal conditions for water resource conservation is decided by the ability to implement adaptive and sustainable water management techniques and technologies that ensure the successful use and conservation of water resources in the foreseeable future. Furthermore, the amount of pollution-related research—particularly advanced pollution control—published in the literature has expanded dramatically over the years and continues to do so. This review focuses on six key components of advanced water pollution management technologies: adsorption, ion exchanges, electrokinetic processes, chemical precipitation, phytobial remediation, and membrane technology. It also discusses how artificial intelligence can be used to regulate water pollution to protect environmental health, sustainability, and security. Water source protection involves the protection of surface water sources (e.g. lakes, rivers, man-made reservoirs) and groundwater sources (e.g. spring protection, dug well protection, and drilled well protection) to avoid water pollution (see also pathogens and contaminants). Water quality is more difficult to maintain due to data gaps and pollution's impact on dimi water quality. As a result, a complete system or strategy for water security and pollution management is required to handle water-related challenges and give a thorough approach to water problem solving.","",https://doi.org/10.9734/bpi/raeges/v4/510,"",,

rayyan-224206035,Patterns and drivers of Holocene moisture variability in mid-latitude eastern North America,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Proxy data for North American hydroclimate (e.g., pollen and other microfossils, sedimentological data, and stable isotopes) indicate major variations in moisture balance including persistent multimillennial droughts during the Holocene. When synthesised with paleoclimate model simulations, the proxies also allow the testing of hypotheses about the drivers and feedbacks involved in the past moisture variations. Recently, advances in (A) the availability of high-resolution proxy records, (B) the numerical methods used to extract the hydroclimate signal from the proxies, and (C) the transient Earth system model simulations of the Holocene, have opened exciting new avenues in unraveling the spatiotemporal progress, magnitudes, and causes of Holocene North American droughts. Here, we apply new machine-learning based (boosted regression tree) pollen&amp;#8211;climate calibrations to reconstruct annual water balance and July temperature from 66 fossil pollen sequences from the eastern North American mid-latitudes. Based on these data, we prepare synthesis paleoclimate reconstructions for three regions, spanning from the prairie&amp;#8211;forest ecotone to the eastern seaboard, designated as Midwest (MW), Great Lakes (GL), and Northeast (NE). The proxy reconstructions are complemented by state-of-the-art model simulations, including the EC-Earth and MPI-ESM transient runs for 8&amp;#8211;0 ka and CESM1 equilibrium runs for 12, 11, and 9 ka. Our water balance reconstructions confirm the major regional offset in drought timing suggested by earlier proxy data, with NE reaching peak drought by 11 ka but with a progressively later timing seen westward in GL (~10 ka) and MW (~7 ka). This spatiotemporal pattern is also reproduced in the model simulations. In the early Holocene simulations, the dipole of wet conditions in MW vs. dry in NE can be clearly linked to dynamical changes in atmospheric circulation, linked to anticyclonic blocking over the residual Laurentide Ice Sheet. This confluence between our water balance reconstructions and the new-generation model simulations gives strong support to the hypothesis that the broadscale drought progress can be explained by the combination of decreasing summer insolation and the waning of the Laurentide glacial anticyclone, which diverted the northward moisture advection from the mid-continent towards the eastern seaboard. Beyond these multimillennial patterns, our proxy reconstructions show coherent centennial events in moisture and temperature. Wavelet analyses of the reconstructions and the transient simulations reveal significant periodicities in both water balance and July temperature, most commonly in the 0.2&amp;#8211;0.6 ka wavelength range in the reconstructions and at 0.1&amp;#8211;0.2 ka in the simulations. In the MPI-ESM and EC-Earth simulations, the mid-Holocene drought is driven by a combination of lower-than-preindustrial precipitation together with increased potential evapotranspiration due to warmer summer temperatures. The relative drought through most of the Holocene, seen in both the reconstructions and the simulations, suggests that the recent and modern climate is unusually wet while drier conditions seem to be the norm during the Holocene. Looking towards the future, it is hence plausible that reverting the natural neoglacial cooling of the recent millennia with anthropogenic global warming might cause a return of drier conditions due to a higher evaporative demand that is not compensated by higher precipitation.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu24-2429,"",,

rayyan-224206130,Merging Earth Observation imagery and model simulations to monitor long-term global snow cover dynamics,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Remote sensing imagery offers a unique tool to monitor the snow cover evolution both at global and regional scales. However, the availability of the time series of normally 3-4 decades limits the applicability of the data to understand the dynamics of snow processes at longer time scale (Pulliainen et al., 2020). In this perspective the possibility to generate hybrid dataset merging satellite records with model simulations is offering the chance to both cross-validate the model simulations and to extent the time series (Lenton et al 2024). In this work, an approach proposed by Notarnicola 2022, with the aim to merge earth observation imagery and modelled data was adapted to generate longer time series. The method is a machine learning approach based on Artificial Neural Network (ANN), where the uncertainties on the ANN trained model were obtained through a bootstrap procedure with a resampling technique. As modelled data, the NOAA-CIRES-DOE 20th Century Reanalysis V3 contains land surface and meteorological maps and their uncertainty available in the period 1806-2015 was addressed (Slivinski et al., 2019). For satellite data, the longest time series on snow parameters were used derived from ESA Climate Change Initiative (CCI) Snow project, namely Snow Water Equivalent (SWE) data available from 1979 to 2020 (https://climate.esa.int/en/odp/#/project/snow). As predictors for the ANN training and test, dynamics variables such as air temperature and precipitation were considered as they regulate the snow dynamics and rainfall events. As static parameters, the location in terms of latitude and longitude, mean elevation, the land cover type, and percentage of vegetation cover were inserted. The target variable to be improved is the snow water equivalent value at pixel level.&amp;#160; Before the application of the ANN approach, a comparison between the SWE values in two data sets for the overlapping period (1979-2015) indicated an averaged correlation coefficient of around 0.52, a bias in the range 35-42 mm, the latter one being strongly depending on the different months. After the application of the model derived by the trained ANN applied to the test dataset, the correlation coefficients raised on average to 0.87, and the RMSE is reduced to around 20 mm.

Lakes are also key components of biogeochemical processes and regulate climate through cycling of carbon. Thus the estimation of trends and variability of the lake surface water storage is very critical, the direct human activities (damming and water consuption) and the natural factors (precipitation, runoff, temperature and potential evaporation) is gradually changing this environmentally sensitive region, especially the glacier retreat and permafrost thawing partially drive alpine lake expansion. The objective is mainly estimating the trends and variability of lake surface water storage using the deep learning module and long-term multi-source remote sensing data from the source region of the Yellow River. Optical remote sensing time-series images (Landsat 5-9, MODIS, and Sentinel-2) are employed to generate high-resolution, complete and closed lake surface shorelines and areas based on the Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGAN) deep learning method. Additionally, radar altimeters (GFO, T/P, Jason-1/2/3, Sentinel-6, ERS-2, Envisat, Cryosat-2, Saral/AltiKa, Sentinel 3/SRAL, ICESat, and ICESat-2) are utilized to recover lake water levels through the application of the Spatial-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (ST-GAN) deep learning method, providing insights into the long-term changes in lake water surface storage from 1992 to 2022.

rayyan-224206242,Exploring Water Management Strategies for Mitigating Local Drought Impacts in the Netherlands using Data-Driven methods previously used for Simulations to Projections,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Extreme events like droughts and floods can have significant impact on the environment and society. As a result effective water management strategies are necessary to limit and mitigate these impacts. In the past decade, the Netherlands has experienced several extreme drought events, raising increasing interest in adapting water management practices, traditionally focused on floods, to address droughts more directly and effectively. Machine learning techniques have previously been tested for the same region in terms of seasonal forecasting1 &amp;#160;and projections2 under different warming scenarios3, showing the additional benefit of these techniques in downscaling large-scale input data to local-scale relevant information for water managers. This recent work aims to go a step further to explore water management options for drought mitigation by incorporating machine learning in a framework of hydrological simulations, water management scenarios and impact functions. By incorporating the insights gained from previous work, a closer focus is given on human aspects and its impact on local drought management. We developed a Multi-Target Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model which facilitates the exploration of different water management options. An essential finding is that taking proactive actions earlier can further limit drought impacts and help to mitigate long recovery periods that would have been observed otherwise. With the Multi-LSTM water management model we can potentially reduce drought impact by 3-5% for the droughts in 2003, 2015 and 2018. As a results, this work yields valuable insights for operational water management and potential improvements in water management strategies with machine learning techniques to effectively address future drought events. 1) Hauswirth, S.

This research paper attempts to discover the automated water regulation systems that utilize advanced technologies like Artificial Intelligence (AI), the Internet of Things (IoT), and data interpretation to upgrade irrigation practices and boost sustainable resource management. By using sensors that keep the soil moisture and the environmental conditions in check, accurate modifications can be made to the irrigation being provided. Keeping a check can help reduce water wastage by up to 30% and increase crop yield by an average of 15%. This study amplifies the productivity of smart meters and the demand for AI-driven prediction models that are capable of providing accurate forecasts and real-time data, both of which are very necessary for efficient water management. However, there exist challenges like the question of data security, high initial costs, and user acceptance. These challenges need to be addressed to make sure that these systems are widely adopted. The considerable potential of the automated water management systems to promote sustainable practices in agriculture and to ensure food security when water scarcity is increasing are highlighted via the findings made in this paper. 1 This paper has been written after taking several research papers written by scholars and professors in this field.

rayyan-224206288,Reliability of Satellite-Based Rainfall Products for Water Man-agement Studies: the Case of The Ankavia River Basin in Madagascar,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Hydrological modeling for water management in large watersheds requires accurate spatially-distributed rainfall time series. In case of low coverage density of ground-based measurements, satellite precipitation products (SPP) constitute an attractive alternative, the quality of which must nevertheless be verified. The objective of this study was to evaluate, at different time scales, the reliability of six SPPs against a 2-year record from a network of 14 rainfall gauges located in the Ankavia catchment (Madagascar). The SPPs considered in this study are the African Rainfall Estimate Climatology (ARC2), the Climate Hazards group Infrared Precipitation with Station data (CHIRPS), the ECMWF Reanalysis (ERA5), the Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for Global Precipitation Measurement (IMERG), the Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks (PERSIANN), and the African Rainfall Estimation (REF2) products. The results suggest that IMERG (R&amp;sup2; = 0.63, slope of linear regression a = 0.96, root mean square error RMSE = 12 mm/day, mean absolute error MAE = 5.5 mm/day) outperforms other SPPs at the daily scale, followed by REF2 (R&amp;sup2; = 0.41, a = 0.94, RMSE = 15 mm/day, MAE = 6 mm/day) and ARC2 (R&amp;sup2; = 0.30, a = 0.88, RMSE = 16 mm/day, MAE = 6.7 mm/day). All SPPs, with the exception of the ERA5, overestimate the &amp;lsquo;no rain&amp;rsquo; class (0 &amp;ndash; 0.2 mm/day). ARC2, IMERG, PERSIANN, and REF2 all underestimate rainfall occurrence in the 0.2 &amp;ndash; 150 mm/day rainfall range, whilst CHIRPS and ERA5 overestimate it. Only CHIRPS and PERSIANN could estimate extreme rainfall (&amp;amp;gt;150 mm/day) satisfactorily. According to the Critical Success Index (CSI) categorical statistical measure, IMERG performs quite well in detecting rain events in the range 2-150 mm/day, whereas PERSIANN outperforms IMERG for rain events larger than 150 mm/day. Because it performs best at daily scale, only IMERG was evaluated for time scales other than daily. At the yearly and monthly time scales, the performance is good with R&amp;sup2; = 0.97 and 0.87, respectively. At the event time scale, the probability distribution function PDF of rain gauge values and IMERG data show good agreement. However, at hourly time scale, the correlation between ground-based measurements and IMERG data becomes poor (R2 = 0.20). Overall, the IMERG product can be regarded as the most reliable satellite precipitation source at monthly, daily and event time scales for hydrological applications in the study area, but the poor agreement at hourly time scale and the inability to detect extreme rainfall &amp;gt;200 mm/day may nevertheless restrict its use.","",https://doi.org/10.20944/preprints202207.0146.v1,"",,

As climate change continues to affect these interactions, identifying the specific drivers of LAC variability has become increasingly important. However, due to the complexity of the coupling mechanism, a quantitative understanding of the potential drivers is still lacking. Recently, deep learning has been considered as an effective approach to capture nonlinear relationships within the data, which provides a useful window into complex climatic processes. In this study, we will explore the LAC variability under climate change and its potential drivers by using Convolutional Long Short-term Memory (ConvLSTM) together with explainable AI techniques for attribution analysis.

This impact has led to a rising likelihood of over-extraction of groundwater by Taiwanese farmers due to insufficient water resources. Quantifying groundwater pumping activities is challenging, thereby prompting this study to introduce a hybrid AI model combining a Convolutional-based Autoencoder with LSTM. The objective is to explore the spatiotemporal relationship between hydrometeorology and groundwater for providing a quantitative assessment of groundwater resources. To construct the model, a comprehensive dataset spanning two decades (2000-2019) is utilized, incorporating information from 33 groundwater monitoring wells in the Jhuoshuei River basin of Taiwan. Two types of datasets, observation and simulation, are employed for a robust analysis. The hybrid AI model yields accurate three-month-ahead forecasts for shallow groundwater in the Jhuoshuei River basin, with R2 performance ranging from 0.70 to 0.87 for T+1 (short-term forecasts) and from 0.42 to 0.69 for T+3 (long-term forecasts). The significance of these forecasts lies in their potential to empower farmers to increase crop cultivation efficiency. The long-term forecasts aid in formulating strategic plans for crop cultivation and fallow periods, promoting efficient agricultural management. Simultaneously, the short-term forecasts empower farmers to enhance irrigation efficiency, leading to a reduction in regional water consumption. This proactive approach aligns with Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 11 and 12, fostering sustainable water resource management practices.

Machine-learning methods, especially deep networks, have strong predictive skills yet are unable to answer specific scientific questions. A recently proposed genre of physics-informed machine learning, called &amp;#8220;differentiable&amp;#8221; modeling (DM, https://t.co/qyuAzYPA6Y), trains neural networks (NNs) with process-based equations (priors) together in one stage (so-called &amp;#8220;end-to-end&amp;#8221;) to benefit from the best of both NNs and process-based paradigms. The NNs do not need target variables for training but can be indirectly supervised by observations matching the outputs of the combined model, and differentiability critically supports learning from big data. We propose that differentiable models are especially suitable as global hydrologic models because they can harvest information from big earth observations to produce state-of-the-art predictions (https://mhpi.github.io/benchmarks/), enable physical interpretation naturally, extrapolate well (due to physical constraints) in space and time, enforce known physical laws and sensitivities, and leverage progress in modern AI computing architecture and infrastructure.

rayyan-224206402,Advancing water resource management: Insights and implications from global machine learning models in groundwater prediction,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Accurate and reliable predictions of groundwater levels are essential for sustainable water resource management. Faced with the impacts of climate change and the increasing stress on groundwater resources, there is a growing necessity to balance domestic, agricultural, and industrial utilization. To address these challenges, innovative and progressive approaches in predicting groundwater levels are necessary, such as the application of machine learning (ML) methods. The advancement of these ML-based prediction models is a crucial component of the BMBF project KIMoDIs. Within this research initiative, an AI-based monitoring, data management, and information system for coupled prediction and early warning of low groundwater levels and groundwater salinisation is being developed. Currently, the state-of-the-art in hydrogeology involves individual models for each groundwater monitoring well (local models). While local models can achieve high predictive accuracy, their application to a multitude of measurement points is impractical. Conversely, global models allow training and prediction for multiple measurement wells simultaneously. This model class has the potential to learn and capture dynamics beyond a single well and their dependency on dynamic input variables (e.g., meteorological parameters) as well as static variables (e.g., specific hydro(geo)logical or morphometric site properties). Particularly with extensive training datasets, global model approaches can provide predictions at measurement points sharing similar site properties to those used in training (generalization). Additionally, they offer advantages in terms of computational requirements as well as model management, as only one model needs to be trained and applied over a large area. The objective of this study is to demonstrate the predictive capabilities of modern ML methods in the context of groundwater level prediction. Further, it provides insights and recommendations regarding the extent to which global models, with a wealth of spatial and temporal information, can contribute to improve prediction accuracy. Global ML models are used for short-term prediction of groundwater levels on a regional scale: Two model architectures (Temporal Fusion Transformer and Neural Hierarchical Interpolation for Time Series Forecasting) are applied to over 5000 groundwater monitoring points in Germany in order to predict groundwater levels for up to 12 weeks. Meteorological data and historical groundwater level data dating back to 1990 (dynamic features) as well as hydrogeological, soil and morphometric properties (static features) are used as input data.

A recent paradigm for streamflow modeling, integrating DLMs and PBMs within a differentiable framework, presents considerable potential to match the performance of DLMs while simultaneously generating untrained variables that describe the entire water cycle. However, the potential of this framework has mostly been verified in small and unregulated headwater basins and has not been explored in large and highly regulated basins. Human activities, such as reservoir operations and water transfer projects, have greatly changed natural hydrological regimes. Given the limited access to operational water management records, PBMs generally fail to achieve satisfactory performance and DLMs are challenging to train directly. This study proposes a coupled hybrid framework to address these problems. This framework is based on a distributed PBM, the Xin'anjiang (XAJ) model, and adopts embedded deep learning neural networks to learn the physical parameters and replace the modules of the XAJ model reflecting human influences through a differentiable structure. Streamflow observations alone are used as training targets, eliminating the need for operational records to supervise the training process. The Hanjiang River basin (HRB), one of the largest subbasins of the Yangtze River basin, disturbed by large reservoirs and national water transfer projects, is selected to test the effectiveness of the framework. The results show that the hybrid framework can learn the best parameter sets of the XAJ model depicting natural and human influences to improve streamflow simulation. It performs better than a standalone XAJ model and achieves similar performance to a standalone LSTM model. This framework sheds new light on assimilating human influences to improve simulation performance in disturbed river basins with limited operational records.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu24-4325,"",,
rayyan-224206671,Deep learning based differentiable/hybrid modelling of the global hydrological cycle,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"The integration of machine learning (ML) and process based modeling (PB) in so-called hybrid models, also known as differentiable modelling, has recently gained popularity in the geoscientific community (Reichstein et al. 2019; Shen et al. 2023). The approach aims to address limitations in both ML (data adaptive but di&amp;#64256;icult to interpret and physically inconsistent) and PB (physically consistent and interpretable but biased). It holds significant potential for studying uncertain processes in the global water cycle (Kraft et al. 2022). In this work, we developed a differentiable/hybrid model of the global hydrological cycle by fusing deep learning with a custom PB model. The model inputs include air temperature, precipitation, net radiation as dynamic forcings, and static features like soil texture as input to a long short-term memory (LSTM) model. The LSTM represents the uncertain and less understood spatio-temporal parameters which are directly used in a conceptual hydrological model. Simultaneously, we use fully connected neural networks (FCNN) to represent the uncertain spatial parameters. In the hydrological model we represent key water fluxes (e.g. transpiration, evapotranspiration (ET), runoff) and storages (snow, soil moisture and groundwater). The model is constrained against the observation-based data, like terrestrial water storage (TWS) anomalies (GRACE), fAPAR (MODIS) and snow water equivalent (GLOBSNOW). Building upon previous work (Kraft et al. 2022), we improved the representations of key hydrological processes. We now explicitly estimate vegetation state that is directly used to partition ET into transpiration, soil and interception evaporation. We also estimate rooting-zone water storage capacity&amp;#8212;a key hydrological parameter that is still highly uncertain. To asses the robustness of the estimated parameters, we quantify equifinality by training multiple models with random weight initialisation in a 10-fold cross validation setup. The model learns reasonable spatial and spatio-temporal patterns of critical, yet uncertain, hydrological parameters as latent variables. For example, we assess and show that the estimations of global spatial patterns on rooting-zone water storage capacity and transpiration versus ET are plausible. Equifinality quantification indicates that the dynamic patterns of the modelled water storages are robust, while there is a large uncertainty in the mean of soil moisture and TWS.

The reservoirs are used for irrigation, drinking water supply, and electric power generation. Future climate variables such as rainfall, minimum and maximum temperatures were derived from an ensemble Regional Climate Models for two main representative concentration pathway (RCP) scenarios, such as an intermediate emission scenario (RCP4.5) and a severe emission scenario (RCP8.5). A coupled multi-layer perceptron neural networks and cellular automata (MLP-CA) model was implemented to simulate future land use of the region considering the CORINE land cover in 2000, 2006, 2012, and 2018 as a reference dataset. The future land use is then projected until the mid-century (2048) in a six-year interval using the validated MLP-CA model. The soil data from the European soil data center (EUSDAC) was used as input for the SWAT model. The result indicated that the basins could experience a decrease in inflows to the reservoirs. The separate evaluation of climate change and land use changes indicated that the effect of climate change on streamflow variation is more pronounced than the effect of land use change only.

Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a transformative tool in environmental monitoring, revolutionizing the collection, processing, and interpretation of vast data related to natural systems. Environmental monitoring covers biodiversity, land use, air and water quality, and climate change indicators. Traditional methods, reliant on manual data collection and analysis, are costly, time-consuming, and limited in scope. AI enhances the efficiency, accuracy, and scope of these efforts, supporting more effective ecosystem management and conservation strategies.","",https://doi.org/10.4018/979-8-3693-6567-0.ch002,"",,

Its impacts on the river flow regime, sedimentation, lake level decline, and biodiversity have been extensively studied. However, the quantitative influence of the TGR on the downstream water exchange between the Yangtze River and Poyang Lake is lacking attention. In this study, we developed a machine learning model to investigate the river–lake water exchange variations under the TGR operation in typical hydrological years, compared with the natural scenario (i.e., no TGR). The results show that the machine learning model could provide a fast and accurate approach to identify the long-distance impact of reservoirs. The operation of the TGR has significant effects on the water exchange between the Yangtze River and Poyang Lake in the impounding period, with a 10,000 m³/s decrease in reservoir discharge approximately causing a 4,000 m³/s decrease in river–lake water exchange in the dry year and a decrease of 6,000 m³/s and 8,000 m³/s in reservoir discharge causing an increase of 4,000 m³/s and 6,000 m³/s in the normal year and the wet year, respectively. The TGR effect varies with different hydrological conditions of the river and lake, showing longer time range (from May to October) and greater degree (1.5 times the change rate in other years) in the wet year. The TGR operation is beneficial to the water maintenance of the lake in the dry year and flood control in the lake area in the wet year. This study provides a constructive approach and valuable information for decision making in water resource management and ecosystem protection in large river–lake systems.","",https://doi.org/10.3389/feart.2022.876286,"",,

Modeled by the human presence through channels, levees and other hydraulic infrastructures, this is a &amp;#8220;young territory&amp;#8221;, originated from the &amp;#8220;Taglio di Porto Viro&amp;#8221; done by the Republic of Venice, around 1600, in order to divert the Po river mouth southward and avoid silting of lagoon harbors. Beyond its high natural, economic and cultural value, this area is exposed to multiple hazards related to floods and &amp;#160;storm surges, droughts, erosion, subsidence, water pollution and loss of biodiversity, exacerbated by soil consumption and climate change; one of the highest threats is the salinization of surface,&amp;#160; groundwater and soils, due to the increasing of duration and extension of salt intrusion from the Adriatic Sea (Enhance, 2016; Allodi, 2022). Particularly during low flows, as in Summer 2022 (GDO, 2022), salt intrusion reduces fresh water availability&amp;#160; for drinking supply, agriculture and industry, as also for balancing habitat salinity and guaranteeing&amp;#160; ecological benefits. For many years this fragile and dynamic context has been under systematic observation, related to salt intrusion as also to liquid discharges, solid transport, topography, hydrodynamics, tides and beach morphology (Visentini, 1940; Cati, 1981). Within the current multi level-multi actor governance system, since 1995 the Emilia-Romagna Regional Agency for Prevention, Environment and Energy (Arpae) is involved in the integrated monitoring&amp;#160; of the Po River Delta, supporting &amp;#160;water protection and use, flood management and the general sustainability of human activities. Through the Idro Meteo Climate &amp;#160;(SIMC) and the ""Daphne"" Oceanographic Structures, Arpae &amp;#160;collects river, delta and sea water level observations from telemetry networks and discharge measurements and salinity observations from field campaigns. From these monitoring activities it is first possible to maintain stage-discharge equations, particularly at the Pontelagoscuro Station upstream the delta, and consequently to maintain the discharge repartition equations in the delta, depending not only on upstream discharge but also on&amp;#160; hydraulics of each branch and sea level conditions (Settin, 2012); secondly it is possible to support salt intrusion length assessment and estimation in each delta branch, mainly depending on river discharges, their repartition in each delta branch and sea levels conditions (Comune, Turolla, 2023). Territorial knowledge and conservation, based on the integration of in situ monitoring and control, historical data, &amp;#160;other data sources (topography, groundwater, water quality), satellite products, models (including digital twins), artificial intelligence, uncertainties management and high computing capacities, may help better understand earth systems and better simulate future scenarios depending on climate, land use and&amp;#160; social changes. Monitoring of the Po River Delta, is therefore indispensable for theoretical assessment, supporting from-short-to-long-term awareness, decision making and action by public institutions, private enterprises, associations and local community, in order to assuring sustainable and fair water uses and ecosystem services&amp;#160; in a vulnerable area exposed to increasing threats and at the same time rich in opportunities and beauty.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu24-5550,"",,
rayyan-224206809,Using machine learning algorithms to analyze remote sensing and ground-truth Lake Chad’s level data,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract. Lake Chad is facing critical environmental situations since the 1960s due to the effects of climate change and anthropogenic activities on its ecosystems. The statistical analyses of remote sensing climate variables (i.e., evapotranspiration, specific humidity, soil temperature, air temperature, precipitation, soil moisture) and remote sensing and ground-truth lake level applied to the period 1993–2012 reveal that remote sensing lake level data has a skewed distribution and positive significant association with only soil moisture, whereas ground-truth lake level has a symmetrical distribution and negative significant associations with all the climate variables. The regression of remote sensing and ground-truth lake level onto climate variables using Linear Regression (LR), Support Vector Regression (SVR), Regression Tree (RT), Random Forest Regression (RF), and Deep Learning (DL) methods show that (i) RF outperforms the other models with the highest coefficient of determination (R2) and explained variance score (EVS) values and (ii) SVR has the lowest Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and k-fold cross-validation (k-fold CV) values. The RF feature ranking function shows that soil temperature is the major driver of remote sensing lake level fluctuations, whereas precipitation is the first factor for ground-truth lake level. This study provides more in-depth knowledge of the factors influencing Lake Chad’s level and perspectives for an integrated and forward-looking water management system for connecting climate change, vulnerability, human activities, and water balance research in the Lake Chad human-environment system. We cannot get the necessary ground truth data at this time because of the challenging security situations in the region. However, the development of the data analysis methodology reported here is of fundamental importance in understanding the water cycle dynamics in this important basin, even under challenging field conditions. Verification studies can be performed when more ground-truth data eventually become available.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2022-427,"",,
rayyan-224206812,Hybrid Modeling of Evapotranspiration: Inferring Stomatal and Aerodynamic Resistances Using Combined Physics-Based and Machine Learning,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"The process of evapotranspiration transfers water vapour from vegetation and soil surfaces to the atmosphere, the so-called latent heat flux (𝑄 LE), and thus crucially modulates Earth’s energy, water, and carbon cycles. Vegetation controls 𝑄 LE through regulating the leaf stomata (i.e., surface resistance 𝑟 s) and through altering surface roughness (aerodynamic resistance 𝑟 a). Estimating 𝑟 s and 𝑟 a across different vegetation types proves to be a key challenge in predicting 𝑄 LE. Here, we propose a hybrid modeling approach (i.e., combining mechanistic modeling and machine learning) for 𝑄 LE where neural networks independently learn the resistances from observations as intermediate variables. In our hybrid modeling setup, we make use of the Penman-Monteith equation based on the Big Leaf theory in conjunction with multi-year flux measurements across different forest and grassland sites from the FLUXNET database. We follow two conceptually different strategies to constrain the hybrid model to control for equifinality arising when estimating the two resistances simultaneously. One strategy is to impose an a priori constraint on 𝑟 a based on our mechanistic understanding (theory-driven strategy), while the other strategy makes use of more observational data and adds a constraint in predicting 𝑟 a through multi-task learning of the latent as well as the sensible heat flux (𝑄 H ; data-driven strategy). Our results show that all hybrid models exhibit a fairly high predictive skill for the target variables with 𝑅 2 = 0.82-0.89 for grasslands and 𝑅 2 = 0.70-0.80 for forests sites at the mean diurnal scale. The predictions of 𝑟 s and 𝑟 a show physical consistency across the two regularized hybrid models, but are physically implausible in the under-constrained hybrid model. The hybrid models are robust in reproducing consistent results for energy fluxes and resistances across different scales (diurnal, seasonal, interannual), reflecting their ability to learn the physical dependence of the target variables on the meteorological inputs. As a next step, we propose to test these heavily observation-informed parameterizations derived through hybrid modeling as a substitute for overly simple ad hoc formulations in Earth system models.","",https://doi.org/10.1002/essoar.10512258.1,"",,
rayyan-224206837,"The Marine Biodiversity Observation Network Plankton Workshops: Plankton Ecosystem Function, Biodiversity, and Forecasting—Research Requirements and Applications",,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Plankton is a massive and phylogenetically diverse group of thousands of prokaryotes, protists (unicellular eukaryotic organisms), and metazoans (multicellular eukaryotic organisms; Fig. 1). Plankton functional diversity is at the core of various ecological processes, including productivity, carbon cycling and sequestration, nutrient cycling (Falkowski 2012), interspecies interactions, and food web dynamics and structure (D'Alelio et al. 2016). Through these functions, plankton play a critical role in the health of the coastal and open ocean and provide essential ecosystem services. Yet, at present, our understanding of plankton dynamics is insufficient to project how climate change and other human-driven impacts affect the functional diversity of plankton. That limits our ability to predict how critical ecosystem services will change in the future and develop strategies to adapt to these changes. The Marine Biodiversity Observation Network (MBON; https://geobon.org/bons/thematic-bon/mbon/, last accessed date: 22 Dec 2021), with the support of the Modelling Different Components of Marine Plankton Biodiversity team (MODIV; https://modiv.w.uib.no/, last accessed date: 22 Dec 2021), organized four virtual workshops (first in November 2020, second and third in October 2021, and fourth in November 2021) titled: “Plankton ecosystem functions, biodiversity, and forecasting—research requirements and applications” (https://eqmh.github.io/MBON-Plankton/index.html, last accessed date: 22 Dec 2021). The first workshop held in November 2020 was an initiative of the US-MBON and MODIV teams to bring together members of the ocean sciences community involved in plankton observing and modeling to meet, build rapport, and exchange expertise. The following workshops were organized to accommodate time differences: one for South, Central, and North America in October 2021; one for Africa, Europe, the Middle East, and India in October 2021; and one for East Asia and Oceania in November 2021. Each workshop was held for two consecutive days, and participation was limited to 20–25 participants per workshop to enable interactive discussions. In total, 80 participants from 26 countries attended at least one of the workshops (Fig. 2). A detailed list of participants can be found in the workshops' website (https://eqmh.github.io/MBON-Plankton/participants.html, last accessed date: 22 Dec 2021). The United States of America and Australia were the countries with the most participants, followed by Canada, Germany, China, the United Kingdom, and Argentina. The objectives of the workshops were to: (1) identify requirements with respect to the definition of essential ocean variables (EOVs) and associated measurements, as well as compile the data needed to address critical knowledge gaps related to the role of plankton biodiversity functions to provide ecosystem services; (2) discuss ways to better link empirical observations to theoretical concepts of plankton biodiversity and ecosystem dynamics; and (3) suggest methods to better communicate the value of plankton to peers and non-scientific audiences. Participants discussed possible actions to overcome these challenges and limitations. There was agreement that observations in natural ocean habitats are fundamental to the formulation and testing of new hypotheses and conceptual models. More active communication between data providers and users will benefit the data collection, interpretation and analysis, and usability. For example, data that allow quantifying relationships among species traits (e.g., size, stoichiometry) will help inform understanding of species responses to environmental conditions. Although participants agreed that there is a lack of standardization of methods, data formatting, and distribution methods, in addition to a paucity of information on data quality and uncertainty, they also recognized the challenges of establishing a global protocol for field practices considering the regional environmental differences. For example, a net with a smaller mesh size is needed in tropical regions because plankton body size generally declines with warming (Campbell et al. 2021), in contrast a net with a larger mesh size which is towed faster is needed if the target is euphausiids rather than copepods. As a solution, participants suggested the use, further expansion, and explanation of existing protocols as best practices, and the set of minimum data and measurements required for data synthesis be laid out. Additionally, the creation of a community-driven unit conversion policy will help to normalize datasets and allow for a better understanding of variability and uncertainty. These approaches can help develop and validate models and minimize the uncertainty in data-driven meta-analysis studies. It was also agreed that, as a community, we need to build capacity at three levels: taxonomic ability, data science, and data management. We need to highlight the fundamental role of taxonomists in providing high-quality data, and of data scientists for data-driven meta-analysis and synthesis. Databases should follow Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reuse principles, to credit and recognize the original data providers. Sufficient funds for the curation and archiving of project data should be included in future funding proposals at the national and international levels. Participants identified the ideal scenario for data users is interlinked data repositories, standardized conversion tables, interoperable data collection protocols, and documented uncertainty levels. Each is a rather challenging task. As a first step, participants recommend an inventory of plankton databases with a summary of their holdings such as the geographic area covered, time covered, types of plankton data included, and information on data format and access (e.g., GOOS Biology and Ecosystems Panel, https://www.goosocean.org/index.php?option=com_oe&task=viewGroupRecord&groupID=339, last accessed date: 28 Jan 2022). The value of plankton is mainly invisible and difficult to quantify, mostly because the public is aware of the ultimate ecosystem service delivered, but not the underlying ecosystem functions of organisms that deliver that service (e.g., the connection of plankton to fish and fisheries). That is, plankton are valuable through their provisioning of ecological and biogeochemical services that enhance the cultural and economic value of the marine environment. They are responsible for approximately half of the Earth's oxygen production and photosynthetic carbon fixation (Field et al. 1998), and play the fundamental “bio” role in biogeochemical cycling of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and many other elements. They are linked through the food web to higher trophic levels and generate economic and recreational benefits for humans. Plankton are involved in feedback processes that affect the evolution and survival of all marine species (Falkowski 2012), and promote marine biodiversity such as fish, benthic organisms, marine and even terrestrial birds, and mammals. Many participants highlighted that although public awareness of the value of the services provided by plankton are often unrecognized, plankton is usually known for negative reasons, such as blooms of pathogenic bacteria, harmful algae, or jellyfish. The value of plankton to policy makers and the public can be highlighted by quantifying in economic terms and illustrating the link between plankton biodiversity and things we value (e.g., iconic species, recreational activities, water quality, carbon storage, nature conservation). Citizen science, education, science-art projects, and outreach activities are important ways to raise this awareness. There are many plankton-related outreach activities for all ages, but as outreach is commonly the least-funded component of scientific projects, it is imperative that we find ways to advance them. Models, virtual reality, and artificial intelligence could also be further developed as heuristic educational tools. One way to improve awareness is to integrate social scientists and those involved with science advice and policy into the development of research grants, approach mass media communication, and also consider opportunities presented by the Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development (2021–2030) as proclaimed by the United Nations (https://en.unesco.org/ocean-decade, last accessed date: 22 Dec 2021).

rayyan-224206852,A 1-km daily soil moisture dataset of China based on in-situ measurement using machine learning,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract. High quality gridded soil moisture products are essential for many Earth system science applications, and they are usually available from remote sensing or model simulations with coarse resolution. Here we present a 1 km resolution long-term dataset of soil moisture derived through machine learning trained with in-situ measurements of 1,789 stations, named as SMCI1.0. Random Forest is used to predict soil moisture using ERA5-land time series, leaf area index, land cover type, topography and soil properties as covariates. SMCI1.0 provides 10-layer soil moisture with 10 cm intervals up to 100 cm deep at daily resolution over the period 2010–2020. Using in-situ soil moisture as the benchmark, two independent experiments are conducted to investigate the estimation accuracy of the SMCI1.0: year-to-year experiment (ubRMSE ranges from 0.041–0.052 and R ranges from 0.883–0.919) and station-to-station experiment (ubRMSE ranges from 0.045–0.051 and R ranges from 0.866–0.893). SMCI1.0 generally has advantages over other gridded soil moisture products, including ERA5-Land, SMAP-L4 and SoMo.ml. However, the high errors of soil moisture often located in North China Monsoon Region. Overall, the highly accurate estimations of both the year-to-year and station-to-station experiments ensure the applicability of SMCI1.0 to studies on the spatial-temporal patterns. As SMCI1.0 is based on in-situ data, it can be useful complements of existing model-based and satellite-based datasets for various hydrological, meteorological, and ecological analyses and modeling. SMCI1.0 can be accessed at http://dx.doi.org/10.11888/Terre.tpdc.272415 (Shangguan et al., 2022).","",https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-2022-177,"",,
rayyan-224206861,Application of Ensemble approach for Stream flow forecasting for Indian River basin,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Flooding poses a significant threat to human life, property, and the environment, especially in semi-arid river basins where the occurrence of intense rainfall events can lead to flash floods. Early warning systems are crucial for mitigating the impact of floods, and accurate streamflow prediction is a key component of these systems. This research focuses on developing an ensemble approach for streamflow prediction to enhance the effectiveness of early warning systems in Indian river basin. Traditional deterministic models may struggle to capture the complex hydrological processes and uncertainties associated with these regions. In response to this challenge, ensemble methods, which combine multiple models or data sources, have gained popularity for improving the accuracy and reliability of predictions. The Indian River Basin faces unique challenges in water resource management due to its diverse hydrological characteristics and the impact of climate variability. This research presents an innovative application of an ensemble approach for streamflow forecasting tailored specifically for the complex dynamics of the Indian River Basin. The research employs a combination of hydrological models, meteorological data, and machine learning techniques to develop an ensemble streamflow prediction system. A Hydrological model such as the HEC-HMS is integrated into the ensemble to leverage their strengths and compensate for individual weaknesses. Additionally, machine learning was applied for post processing of the ensemble data. These are incorporated to capture non-linear relationships and improve the overall predictive performance. The study area selected for this research is a semi-arid Sabarmati river basin with a history of past flood. Historical streamflow data, meteorological observations and remote sensing data are utilized to calibrate and validate the ensemble prediction system. TIGGE Ensemble data from ECMWF, NCEP, IMD and NCMRWF were used. Research covers machine learning approaches post processing methods such as BMA, cNLR, HXLR, OLR, logreg, hlogreg, etc were applied. The probabilistic forecasts were validated using the Brier Score (BS), Area Under Curve (AUC) of Receiver Operator Characteristics (ROC) plots and reliability plots. The cNLR and BMA strategies for postprocessing performed exceptionally well with Brier score value 0.10 and RPS value 0.11 at all grid points for both methods.&amp;#160; The ROC-AUC values for the cNLR and BMA methods were found to be 91.87% and 91.82% respectively. Furthermore, the research focuses on developing an effective flood early warning system based on the ensemble predictions. The results of the ensemble streamflow prediction system are evaluated against traditional deterministic models and individual hydrological models. Performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, and lead time are analysed to assess the effectiveness of the ensemble approach in comparison to single-model predictions. The findings demonstrate the superiority of the ensemble method in capturing the variability of streamflow by improving the lead time for flood warnings. In conclusion, this research contributes to the advancement of flood prediction methods in Indian river basin by introducing an ensemble approach that combines hydrological models and machine learning techniques. The findings have implications for water resource management, disaster preparedness, and the sustainable development of semi-arid regions.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu24-18944,"",,

Shortage of labor, and the rising demand for food production is adding further strain to conventional agricultural practice. The advent of new technologies like Internet of Things (IoT) and Machine Learning (ML) is providing numerous benefits in agriculture to offset the aforementioned challenges via advanced crop and soil monitoring, automation in agriculture processes, and smart water management systems. For instance, UAVs equipped with sensors are being considered to collect data in real-time via remote sensing technology to monitor crop health assessment on a large scale. In this chapter, smart data collection systems for parameters such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium contents of the soil; average soil temperature; moisture; soil pH, and rainfall are described. Additionally, existing open-source datasets with the aforementioned parameters and crop labels are assessed. Furthermore, suitable ML models for the selected datasets would be described, implemented programmatically, trained and tested. The corresponding results will then be analyzed and discussed in further detail in forthcoming sections in this chapter. This study will provide the reader with a global overview of some existing IoT-based technologies for data collection in the agricultural context as well as some of the corresponding machine learning techniques that can be used in this case.

rayyan-224206923,Data Fusion of Regional Reanalysis- and Sentinel (Earth Observation)-based Products with Machine Learning Tools for Monitoring Evapotranspiration and Drought,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Accounting of the hydrologic process of evapotranspiration (ET) or consumptive use of water is important for water resources allocation, irrigation management, drought early warning, climate change impact assessment as well as in agro-water-climate nexus modeling. In fact, monitoring the United Nations' sustainable development goals (SDGs) that emphasize on improved food security, access to clean water, promotion of sustainable habitats and mitigation of natural disasters (droughts) hinge upon access to better quality data of ET. Though numerous studies have targeted accurate estimation of potential evapotranspiration (PET) using earth observation (EO) data; hydrologists are yet to reach consensus on the best set of predictor variables that can be used irrespective of spatio-temporal scale. This can be attributed to the nonlinear and complex nature of the process of ET. When it comes to the estimation of actual ET (AET), studies employing Eddy Covariance (EC) towers have been successful in different regions of the world. However, the developing countries of the world lack access to EC observations, requiring viable economical methods for accurate ET measurement, even using reliable estimates of PET. The proposed study explored fusion of regional climate reanalysis data, EO data, and machine learning techniques for high-resolution PET estimation. In this analysis, owing to the documented success of data-driven models in hydrological studies, performance of two machine learning models- tree based Random Forest (RF) and regressor Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS), are evaluated for estimating monthly PET. A suite of input predictors are chosen to describe three model categories: meteorological-, EO- and hybrid-based predictor models. There are about 10 input combinations that can be generated for the PET model development, particularly for an agriculture-dominated study region - Dhenkanal district, located in Odisha in eastern part of India. In this study, reanalysis-based (meteorological) inputs at a grid resolution of 0.12&amp;#176; and Sentinel 2A (EO) products at spatial resolution of 20 m have been used. Results of the analysis indicate that solar radiation is the most important meteorological variable that controls PET estimation. Among the vegetation indices obtained from remote sensing data, we find that the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) that represents availability of water in plants and soil, is particularly useful. The best PET estimation model that uses only solar radiation and few vegetation indices (NDVI, NDWI) gave coefficient of determination (R2) 0.88 and root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.14 during validation stage, whereas the use of hybrid predictor model that utilize temperature and vegetation indices information further reduced the error and increased the prediction accuracy (6.86%). When the meteorological inputs: precipitation and wind speed are only used, model did not perform well. Mapping the ET using the proposed models can facilitate reporting of progress in SDG with regard to water use, crop water stress, adaptation to agricultural droughts and food security. In this context, the Evaporative Demand Drought Index (EDDI) is computed across the study region to understand the drought patterns in the region.

rayyan-224206945,A Stochastic Deep Learning Approach for Projecting Storm Surges in the Context of Climate Change,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Projections of sea level rise are vital for assessing the impacts of climate change, especially in coastal regions. Present sea level rise projections are primarily focused on monthly water levels, but tend to underrepresent the critical role of storm surges. There are some studies that also provide projections of storm surges along global coastlines based on numerical models using meteorological forcing data from Global Climate Models (GCMs). However, those applications are limited by coarse meteorological inputs as well as the computational demands placed by running numerical models for an ensemble of different GCMs and climate change scenarios. We propose a stochastic deep learning model trained on model output from numerical surge models. It is designed to capture the spatial and temporal dependencies that are characteristic of storm surge time series. Our approach generates potential storm surge scenarios that are consistent with GCM outputs but are not directly determined by those meteorological inputs. A second advantage is that the trained machine learning model has lower computational demands than traditional numerical models which makes it possible to explore different GCMs and climate change scenarios.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu24-19209,"",,
rayyan-224206951,Long-term hydrological budget over urban areas: approaches and challenges,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Urbanisation substantially alters the permeability of the land surface and modifies the vegetation cover extent and type. These landcover changes profoundly affect the hydrological and energy budget. While the role of urbanization on the local flood response has been extensively studied, its effect on the long-term hydrological budget is much less known as computing the latent heat flux (evapotranspiration) in urban areas is still challenging. However, knowledge on the urban hydrological budget is important as many cities are planning water sensitive urban designs and water harvesting could be key to support an increasing amount of urban vegetation. This study quantifies how urbanization changed the long-term hydrological budget of the island city state Singapore for the period between 1982 to 2021. To do so, we use two state-of-the-art mechanistic models which include all the major hydrological components such as runoff, soil and interception water storage, transpiration, and evaporation. The first is Tethys-Chloris (T&amp;amp;C), which is a mechanistic ecohydrological model that can resolve the water, carbon and energy budgets at high spatio-temporal resolutions but considers the urban effects in a simplistic way by only modifying the impervious fraction of the land surface and its roughness. The second is its urban counterpart, Urban Tethys-Chloris (UT&amp;amp;C), which explicitly resolves shading and radiation reflection within an urban canyon accounting for different urban vegetation types and configurations and explicitly resolves the local urban climate and hydrology. UT&amp;amp;C is however too computationally costly to simulate an entire city at high spatial resolution. Hence, a machine learning approach, where a multimodal neural network comprising a Conv1D layer followed by LSTM layers for dynamic meteorological inputs and Dense layers for static inputs such as urban properties, is used to re-map UT&amp;amp;C outputs over the entire city based on a few selected covariates. By cross comparing the different approaches to compute the long-term water budget over urban areas, we highlight the involved uncertainties, and we can gain insights into the impact of urban development on modifying the water availability in Singapore. The island city-state relies on water harvesting as one source of water supply for households and knowledge of water availability is extremely important for long-term water management purposes.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu24-13909,"",,

Therefore, this study aimed to generate a long-term wetland classification dataset for the YRB and further investigate the long-term wetland variations on the YRB flood risk assessments for the period from 1985 to 2021. The dataset named Long-Term Wetland Classification Dataset for YRB (LTWCD_YRB) was created using a Random Forest machine learning classifier on Google Earth Engine with 30m resolution Landsat 5, 7, 8 muti-spectral images. The maps of LTWCD_YRB demonstrated the spatial distribution, annual variability, and seasonal cycle of nine wetland categories in the extent, and the total validation accuracy can reach 85%. The LTWCD_YRB indicated that the total wetland area of the YRB in 2021 was larger than that in 1985, with constantly increased human-made wetlands and fluctuated natural wetlands. Aquaculture ponds expanded the most (4,987 km2);&amp;#160;inland marsh in the source region was the wetland category with the most fluctuations. Seasonal changes in wetlands were prominent in the Poyang Lake Basin, Dongting Lake Basin, and YRB source region. The LTWCD_YRB&amp;#160;can offer a consistent agreement of wetland area variations with the other satellite-based wetland datasets in the YRB, which is&amp;#160;valuable for researchers&amp;#160;and stakeholders to better understand the YRB wetlands and would support sustainable wetland management practices.&amp;#160;With the&amp;#160;LTWCD_YRB data as modelling inputs, a GIS-based spatial multi-index&amp;#160;flooding risk assessment model was applied for investigating&amp;#160;the long-term implications of wetland variations on flood risks in the YRB. The model results indicate that in the year with large floods and extremely high precipitation, flood risk level increased obviously after adding the wetland factor. For the years with normal precipitation, flood risk level decreased with wetlands expansion and increased with wetlands shrinkage in the YRB. The long-term expansion of aquaculture ponds contributed to a lower flood risk in the Taihu Lake Basin. In contrast, the Poyang Lake Basin experienced an increasing flood risk due to the long-term shrinkage in lake areas resulting from soil erosion and urbanization along the lakeside. This study would be helpful&amp;#160;for stakeholders to develop feasible wetland management practices, and to improve flood risk resilience in the YRB.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu24-4382,"",,
rayyan-224206998,Recalibrating DWD&amp;#8217;s operational climate predictions: towards a user-oriented seamless climate service,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"The German Meteorological Service's (Deutscher Wetterdienst DWD) climate predictions website&amp;#160; (www.dwd.de/climatepredictions) offers a centralized platform for accessing post-processed climate predictions, including subseasonal forecasts from ECMWF's IFS and seasonal and decadal predictions from the German climate prediction system. The website design was developed in collaboration with various sectors to ensure uniformity across all time frames, and users can view maps, tables, and time series of ensemble mean and probabilistic predictions in combination with their skill. The available data covers weekly, 3-month, 1-year, and 5-year temperature means, precipitation sums and soil moisture for the world, Europe, Germany, and particular German regions. To achieve high spatial resolution, the DWD used the statistical downscaling method EPISODES. Moreover, within the BMBF project KIMoDIs (AI-based monitoring, data management and information system for coupled forecasting and early warning of low groundwater levels and salinisation) the DWD provides climate prediction data of further hydrological variables (e.g. relative humidity) with corresponding prediction skill on a regional scale.However, all predictions on these time scales can suffer from inherent systematic errors, which can impact their usefulness. To address these issues, the recalibration method DeFoReSt was applied to decadal predictions, using a combination of 3rd order polynomials in lead and start time, along with a boosting model selection approach. This approach addresses lead-time dependent systematic errors, such as drift, as well as inaccuracies in representing long-term changes and variability.This study highlights the improved accuracy of the recalibration approach on decadal predictions due to an increased polynomial order compared to the original approach, and its different impact on global and regional scales. It also explores the feasibility of transferring this approach to predictions with shorter time horizons of the provided variables.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu24-15974,"",,
rayyan-224207053,The combined impact of redcedar encroachment and climate change on water resources in the Nebraska Sand Hills,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"The Nebraska Sand Hills (NSH) is considered a major recharge zone for the High Plains Aquifer in the central United States. The uncontrolled expansion of the eastern redcedar ( Juniperus Virginiana ) under climate warming is posing threats to surface water and groundwater resources. The combined impact of land use and climate change on the water balance in the Upper Middle Loup River watershed (4,954 km 2 ) in the NSH was evaluated by simulating different combinations of model scenarios using the Soil Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model. A total of 222 climate models were ranked according to the aridity index and three models representing wet, median (most likely), and dry conditions were selected. Additionally, the impacts of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions on root water uptake were simulated. Four plausible redcedar encroachment scenarios, namely 0.5% (no encroachment), 2.4, 4.6, and 11.9%, were considered in the numerical simulations. We, therefore, built: i ) the historical scenario (2000–2019) with the current climate and redcedar cover leading to baseline results; ii ) the most-likely future scenario (2020–2099) with projected climate (50 th percentile of aridity index distribution) and redcedar encroachment that was estimated by using a combination of neural network and Markov-chain cellular automata model; iii ) 16 future scenarios (2020–2099) with different combinations of extreme climate (5 th and 95 th percentiles of aridity index distribution) and four hypothetical encroachment scenarios (0.5, 2.4, 4.6, and 11.9%). The most-likely climate projection indicates that a warming pattern will be expected with a 4.1°C increase in average over the 100-year period, and this will be associated with lower-than-normal precipitation (P). Nevertheless, the concurrent increase in temperature and CO 2 concentration is likely to induce stomata closure by reducing potential (ET p ) and actual (ET a ) evapotranspiration losses. Projected P and ET a are expected to decrease by 10 and 14% while recharge (R) and discharge (D) are expected to increase by 38 and 30% for the period 2020-2050. For the period 2051-2099, the projected P and ET a are expected to decrease by 8 and 32% while R and D are expected to increase by 140.2 and 40%. Finally, a sensitivity analysis of 16 combined climate and land use scenarios is presented and discussed. The scenario modeling approach presented in this paper can support decision-making by stakeholders for optimal management of water resources.","",https://doi.org/10.3389/frwa.2022.1044570,"",,
rayyan-224207058,Featured Collection Introduction: “Connecting Land and Water for Healthy Communities”,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"This featured collection is a part of growing public policy conversation, professional practice, and academic research focused on the need and strategies to integrate land use and water planning. The need arises from fragmentation in the ways that professionals think about and have been organized to deal with land and water in their workplaces and professional organizations. However, there is an increasing recognition that land and water planning must be done jointly because how we use land shapes our demand for water and greatly impacts water quality, while the way we use and manipulate water involves significant changes to land. Integrative land–water strategies are the focus of this featured collection. The collection's purpose is to contribute to fostering land and water connections across the physical, social, and ecological domains. Here we provide a brief background on the origins of this featured collection in a 2021 specialty conference organized and hosted by the American Water Resources Association (AWRA) and the Babbitt Center for Land and Water Policy (Babbitt Center), and done in collaboration with many other sponsors, supporters, and participating organizations. We cover other activities associated with the 2021 specialty conference and plans for continuing conversations at a 2023 follow-up conference. We also highlight some of the themes and insights from this featured collection. Finally, we invite continuing submissions on integrating land and water to the Journal of the American Water Resources Association (JAWRA), which is planning another featured collection on this important topic. This featured collection11 While the guest associate editors of this collection were involved in the conference and are co-authors of some of the publications included here, none of them handled their own submissions and standard blind peer review procedures were strictly followed. The papers also adhered to all other editorial and peer review requirements of the journal. emerged from the 2021 virtual summer specialty conference entitled “Connecting Land and Water for Healthy Communities” (AWRA and Babbitt Center 2021a). The conference was the result of a collaboration between Jim Holway of the Babbitt Center for Land and Water Policy (a center of the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy) and Sharon Megdal of the Water Resources Research Center at the University of Arizona and board member of AWRA. Jim and Sharon are long-time colleagues and friends as well as practitioners and scholars of land and water integration, especially as it pertains to the Colorado River Basin. They served as the conference committee co-chairs from the two partnering host organizations, AWRA and Babbitt Center, and involved leaders and representatives from other national organizations on the conference committee. Those organizations included the Alliance for Water Efficiency (AWE), American Planning Association (APA), American Water Works Association (AWWA), United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), United States Water Alliance, and Water Research Foundation (WRF). Even more organizations were involved on the host and program committees, including representatives from foundations, utilities, universities, private firms, and various state, tribal and federal agencies. Members of the conference, host and program committees comprised the larger conference planning committee (AWRA and Babbitt Center 2021b). The 2021 AWRA specialty conference built on several previous efforts. The APA hosted “Water and Planning Connect” in Kansas City from September 11 to 12, 2018, the first conference aimed at bringing together land use planning and water management professionals from the public and private sectors. The conference addressed the pressing issues at the intersection of land and water, including the effects of climate change, aging infrastructure, and water equity, and how to overcome fragmentation in responding to these large-scale challenges. “Water and Planning Connect” followed several years of activities within APA aimed at recognizing the importance of integrating water into land use planning. These activities included a 2016 update of the APA Policy Guide on Water (APA 2016), the 2017 formation of APA's Water and Planning Network (WPN) (APA 2017), and the 2017 publication of PAS WPN Report 588, “Planners and Water” (Cesanek et al. 2017). More recently, several experts directly involved in these efforts have authored additional publications on the potential impact comprehensive plans have to address land and water integration at a local level (Rouse and Piro 2021; Rugland 2021). APA is an organization largely consisting of land use planners, and its recognition of the importance of considering water in land use planning and corresponding practice-related activities has been a significant contribution. The reciprocal importance of considering the implications of land use planning for water management was brought to the fore in the 2021 “Connecting Land and Water for Healthy Communities” conference by Jim and Sharon along with the original inceptors, Chi Ho Sham of AWWA, William (Bill) Cesanek of APA, and Mary Ann Dickinson, past president of AWE. AWRA, an organization largely consisting of water resource professionals, reached out to land use planners in an effort to connect the professional realms of land and water just as APA did to its water constituents for “Water and Planning Connect” in 2018. The AWRA and Babbitt Center specialty conference was held virtually from July 19 to 21, 2021 and featured keynote speakers Tanya Trujillo, United States Department of the Interior Assistant Secretary for Water and Science, and Aziza Akhmouch, Head of the Urban Policies and Sustainable Development Division within the Centre for Entrepreneurship, SMEs, Regions and Cities of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). The conference also included a pre- and post-conference workshop, two panels, 24 technical sessions, crowdsourcing land and water dialogues, and networking opportunities (AWRA and Babbitt Center 2021c). The mix of activities was designed to bring together practitioners and researchers across the intersecting areas of water management, land use planning, natural resources policy, and related technical and design professions. The conference focused on fostering relationships among water resources management, utility operations, and land use planning and design to strengthen connections across disciplines, professions, and organizations. Topics included land and water aspects of water supply, water demand management, stormwater management, wastewater treatment, community planning and design, conservation, and integrated “one water” approaches. The key theme running throughout the conference was the recognition that connecting land and water is necessary for healthy and resilient communities and that new tools and evidence-based strategies are needed to foster and evaluate experiences with making those connections. This featured collection is just one of the several activities associated with the 2021 “Connecting Land and Water for Healthy Communities” conference. Here we highlight three of them. Preceding the July 2021 conference, AWRA published a special issue of Water Resources IMPACT (March/April 2021, Volume 23, Number 2) on “Connecting Land and Water for Healthy Communities” (AWRA 2021a). The issue was guest edited by Mike Antos, who wrote in “About this Issue” (p. 1): “Arguably, managing water separately from land was one of the great missteps of the 20th century. Turning our eyes to past practices, and recognizing the role watersheds play in the health of the environment and our communities, we see that land and water must be managed together as integrated social-natural systems … I am proud as guest editor to share these stories and examples of how land use managers and water managers are rediscovering the power of partnering for the benefit of people and the environment.” This special issue of Water Resources IMPACT included eight articles introducing important perspectives and work related to the conference theme. Case studies from all over the country focused on integrative land–water solutions, bringing attention to vulnerable communities in flood-prone areas and areas impacted by drought, and specific ways in which strategies for greater integration is key to addressing this vulnerability. This special issue of Water Resource IMPACT was a valuable introduction to topics and actions taking place on the ground in communities that were incorporated into the 2021 specialty conference. One major outcome of the 2021 Conference was the “Findings Statement and Call to Action from the Specialty Conference: Connecting Land & Water for Healthy Communities” which was approved by AWRA with the Babbitt Center for Land and Water Policy, the APA Water and Planning Network, and the AWWA. After the conference, members of the planning committee came together and agreed on the importance of actualizing integrative land and water solutions. Together, they drafted a “Findings Statement” of key conclusions they drew from the diversity of presentations and conversations throughout the conference. These findings acknowledge the major ways fragmentation occurs and how it results in unsustainable patterns of growth and resource utilization that increase vulnerabilities of communities to water and land-related risks. Realizing that a findings statement was not enough, they included a “Call to Action” to encourage their organizations, other conference participants, and the land and water professional community at large to implement the set of guiding principles included in the findings statement. This “Findings Statement and Call to Action” was approved as an official AWRA Policy Statement (AWRA 2021b) and is also reprinted here in this featured collection (AWRA et al. 2021). We are pleased that the productive conversations will continue, and the land and water community will have opportunities to discuss how it is implementing the Call to Action by bringing forth more examples and lessons. In July of 2023, AWRA will be hosting the second specialty conference on the general theme of “Connecting Land and Water for Healthy Communities,” scheduled for July 17 to 19, 2023 in Denver, Colorado (AWRA 2022). Our hope is that this collection of activities, research, and partnerships and yet another opportunity to meet, this time in person in Denver, Colorado, will indeed inspire additional collaborations, new ideas and inquiries, and creative and bold actions that continue leading to implementation of integrative land–water solutions. The 2021 “Connecting Land & Water for Healthy Communities” specialty conference suggests that to ensure healthy and resilient communities, connecting planning and management of land and water is necessary. Moreover, the “Findings Statement and Call to Action” from this conference urges connections between multiple stakeholders and stakeholder groups and utilization of science, tools, practices, and technologies that integrate land and water planning and use. The integration of land and water planning is the foundational thread of the articles in this featured collection. However, the articles also showcase the ways in which integrative land–water solutions can be focused or more expansive in response to diverse stakeholders and varying circumstances and depending on how and where integration can be applied and adapted. Cross-cutting themes emerged in each of these pieces, including issues of scale, context, complexity; the need for new research, new ways of knowing, new tools; working in interdisciplinary teams and spanning boundaries across professions and organizations; the need for local as well as regional land–water coordination; and the use of an institutional lens in recognition of ways society can work more collectively toward larger scale societal sustainability. Stoker et al. (2022) begin this collection with a review of regulatory and non-regulatory strategies for integrated land–water solutions. The authors synthesize existing literature and emphasize the need for new research to establish the evidentiary basis to support the implementation of these strategies, prioritize one strategy over another, and determine the contexts in which various strategies are likely to be most effective. The scales inherent in both regulatory and non-regulatory strategies are apparent in each of the manuscripts included in this featured collection. Turner et al. (2022) also describe differences in scale between local ordinances, which can better integrate water and land use, vs. federal level regulations like the Clean Water Act that focus only on water quality. Sampson et al. (2022) look at city policies and water demand by examining a range of neighborhood housing typologies (essentially different scales of housing density) and conducting scenario planning analyses across the Denver Water service area. Wang and Vivoni (2022) employ regional scenario modeling to investigate the implications of climate and land use and land cover for future irrigation water demand in different cities, irrigation districts, and counties in central Arizona as well as at the regional scale. Endter-Wada et al. (2022) illustrate the scales of governance and institutional influence including examples of policies, processes, and projects at federal, state, local, and utility scales. They focus on cooperation and partnership between and within these scales to mobilize sustainability transitions. Jacobs et al. (2022) focus on the need to integrate planning across scales since different environmental issues occur and are dealt with through institutions with authority and influence in varying geographies (e.g., state, watershed, irrigation district, municipal, and individual property). Highlighting the importance of scale, the manuscripts in this featured collection show that context is an important aspect of integrated land–water management. Turner et al. (2022) note that stormwater professionals stated that multiple factors were part of their stormwater infrastructure decision making, including watershed-scale issues and other added complexities like climate change and social norms (complexities also suggested by Jacobs et al. 2022). They also find regional differences in stormwater professionals' decision making related to water quality (eastern states) vs. water quantity (western states) and potentials for green infrastructure solutions to more effectively help them link land and water. Although Sampson et al. (2022) found that incremental increases in residential density is one way to improve urban water efficiency, policies that reduce outdoor irrigation may have more success at reducing outdoor water demand than policies purely focused on increasing residential densities. They conclude that variations that relate to building type and specific density configurations are important contextual complexities to consider in understanding and managing urban water demand and outdoor water efficiency. Wang and Vivoni (2022) suggest that local contextual differences such as future land use change trajectories combined with climate change predictions are very important elements to consider in irrigation water use projections. Endter-Wada et al. (2022) show how integrating land and water can occur in numerous ways and result in distinctive forms. In their four examples, the integration occurs through analysis, by design, from conceptual borrowing, and via facilitation and, despite general application to many communities, it is context that determines specific outcomes, adopted practices, and instituted policies. Jacobs et al. (2022) highlight that environmental challenges are highly context dependent, including being influenced by social norms, population/demographic changes, and physical and climatic differences. Jacobs et al.’s (2022) call to look at “the intersection of the climate-land use-energy-water systems collectively” (p. 2) is an important consideration in this featured collection looking at integrated water–land planning. The authors remind us that even looking at two issues in an integrated way ignores the true complexity of the issues at hand. Sampson et al. (2022) and Wang and Vivoni's (2022) manuscripts provide focused examinations of water and land use interactions, which are important pieces of the puzzle in terms of water conservation and use. Yet, each manuscript also provides important insights through recognition and analysis of additional components that add complexity. Sampson et al. (2022) simulate the effects of human activity (building types where households choose to live) and other behavioral and technological changes (gains in irrigation efficiency) in addition to increasing housing density on future water demand. Wang and Vivoni's (2022) inclusion of climate change effects as well as differing modes of future land change related to urban growth shows how differences in irrigation water use can become even more pronounced in the future. Their works and insights could be built upon to include even more complexity (e.g., equity in housing; interactions between housing, water and transportation; implications of agricultural land loss on food, fuel, and fiber). Endter-Wada et al.’s (2022) examples speak to the institutional changes needed to move resilient solutions forward. Although the authors looked specifically at integrated land–water solutions, Endter-Wada et al. (2022) show the importance of partnerships and stakeholder engagement to foster institutional transformation that could translate to increasingly complex issues. Recognition of the importance of complexities at the intersection of climate, land use, energy, and water systems (CLEWs) is critical for stretching our analysis and understanding of problems and challenging and enabling us to find appropriate solutions. But it does not negate the need to work at the intersection of land and water. The reason linking land and water remains important is because human interaction with the environment occurs through the processes of using land and water and, increasingly, through processes of large-scale land use change and water manipulation, all of which are driven by social processes. Land changes to the surface of the earth affect the water cycle, especially large-scale urbanization in arid regions and development in flood-prone riparian and coastal areas in humid regions. Similarly, changes to natural water sources and flows affect the land, most dramatically illustrated when water diversions result in desiccated lakes, dry streams, and loss of wetlands, or when water is diverted from basins of origin, often to the detriment of human and ecological communities located on tribal and rural lands. Human changes to land or water without regard to impacts resulting from their linkage are dramatically changing the earth's surface. These changes are resulting in cascading effects on socio-ecological systems and on larger physical and climatic earth system processes. Changes occurring at the interface of land and water policy, planning, and management remain foundational because numerous government agencies have well-established regulatory and management authority over land and/or water as well as deeply rooted professional and institutional cultures where changes are key to societal sustainability transitions. Finally, the authors of the manuscripts and the associate editors of this featured collection suggest the following topics to consider exploring and using in future research and practice. We should strive to create comprehensive open-source data and use exploratory processes and data-driven tools to examine complex issues so that we can learn from each other and provide better decision support, the value of which is illustrated in the articles by Sampson et al. (2022) and Wang and Vivoni (2022). The need to determine metrics to examine water outcome goals and to use these metrics to understand success over time across case studies and contexts was emphasized by Stoker et al. (2022) and suggested in various ways throughout this collection. Developing paths forward to allow for adaptive management in planning, policy, and rulemaking and for institutional transformations rely not only on good analytic and evaluative techniques, but on the ability to build and use interdisciplinary teams, partnerships, and champions of new ideas to work on complex issues, as reinforced in the articles by Turner et al. (2022) and Endter-Wada et al. (2022). Issues at the intersections of climate–land use–energy–water systems are critical, as the questions raised in table 1 by Jacobs et al. (2022) indicate, which highlights why creating frameworks for coordination and integration across scales is so important. As the “Findings Statement and Call to Action” reminds us, integrating equity, health, and safety should be at the heart of every inquiry and practice, and our professions need to commit to guiding principles that help us keep this focus at the forefront of our work. The focus on “Connecting Land and Water for Healthy Communities” in the March/April issue of Water Resource IMPACT, the 2021 specialty conference and resulting “Findings Statement and Call to Action,” and this featured collection of JAWRA all contribute to recognizing land–water disconnections and finding integrated solutions for overcoming them. Much work needs to be done to understand the many dimensions, meanings, and implications of integrating land and water, to promote practices and technologies for facilitating integration, and to evaluate, test, and document the short- and long-term outcomes from integration (Quay et al. 2022). We look forward to land use and water management professionals' joint contributions to this work and to expanding our collective learning and conversations at the second AWRA summer specialty conference on this topic from July 17 to 19, 2023 in Denver, Colorado. Data sharing is not applicable to this article as no new data were created or analyzed in this study.","",https://doi.org/10.1111/1752-1688.13042,"",,
rayyan-224207096,Multidimensional Forecasting of Precipitation and Potential Evapotranspiration in the Paranapanema River Basin Using Neural Network Time Series,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract Spatial and temporal forecasts of the hydrological cycle compartments aiming projections of extreme drought scenarios represent a challenge for the planning, management and monitoring of water resources in order to mitigate potential impacts on the natural environment, civil society and wildlife under climate change. Machine Learning (ML) methods can help in this task, combining constant updating of model information and further scenarios evaluation. This study investigated the application of multidimensional forecast of precipitation and potential evapotranspiration at the Paranapanema River Basin (PRB) for the years 2023 to 2025. PRB is a region that provides hydrological, energy and agricultural resources, located in the southeast of Brazil that has suffered several problems related to water deficit and stress as well as droughts in the last 10 years. For these reasons, geospatial technologies such as remote sensing and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) were applied to generate time series between 2001 and early 2023 for a total of 22 Hydrological Planning Units (HPUs) in the PRB. Subsequently, a Neural Network Auto Regression (NNAR) was used to forecast precipitation and potential evapotranspiration of the HPUs in the period 2023–2025, finding for the months of May, June, July and August of 2024 and later in 2025 possible periods of water deficit in the central and northern regions. Finally, a comparative analysis of possible impacts on the agricultural, energy and social sectors based on the ETA regional climate model and the forecast developed by the NNAR network is presented, showing possible scenarios for short and mid-term water planning in the PRB.","",https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-3925109/v1,"",,

To establish new methodologies for rivers level forecasting is necessary for the implementation of early warning systems. In this work, we present results of a multilayer perceptron artificial neural network (ANN) to forecast temporal series of water levels at the outlet of Rio Negro river with 24-hour antecedence. Input data was collected by a set of hydrological monitoring stations composed of water level and rainfall measures acquired with a one-day resolution. Water-level prediction were evaluated by the Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient (NSE) and by the root mean square error (RMSE). The results show consistency between predicted and observed values, especially when combining both water level and rainfall data. In such case, values of NSE reached 0.93 to 0.54 and RMSE between 0.028 and 0.061 for antecedence of 1 to 7 days respectively with implemented topology for the empirical model.","",https://doi.org/10.5540/03.2022.009.01.0269,"",,
rayyan-224207145,A comparison between machine learning algorithms models to estimate potato's blue water footprint in the arid regions,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Precise assessment of water footprint to enhance water consumption and crop yields for irrigated agricultural efficiency is required in order to achieve water management sustainability. Although Penman-Monteith is more successful than others and is the most frequently used technique to calculate water footprint it requires a significant number of meteorological parameters at different spatio-temporal scales, sometimes inaccessible in many of the poor nations. Due to the greatest performance in the non-linear relations of inputs and output of the model, the complex hydrological phenomena are frequently described in machine learning models. Therefore, the objective of this research is to 1) develop and compare between the four-machine learning: Support Vector Regression (SVR), Random Forest (RF), Extreme Gradient Boost (XGB) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) over three potato’s governorates (Al-Gharbia, Al-Dakahlia, and Al-Beheira) in Delta, Egypt and 2) select the best model in the best combination of climate input variables, which achieves high precision and low error in forecasting potato blue WF. The available variables for this study are maximum temperature (T ), minimum temperature (T ), average temperature (T ), wind speed (WS), relative humidity (RH), precipitation (P), vapor pressure deficit (VPD), solar radiation (SR), Sown area (SA), and crop coefficient (Kc) to predict potato BWFP during (1990 -2016). Six scenarios of input variables were used to test the weight of each variable in for four applied models. Different statistical indicators have been used to assess applied model performance (NSE, RMSE, MAE, MBE, A, R2, SI and MAPE). The results demonstrated that Sc5 with the XGB and ANN model is competent enough to evaluate BWF only if there are just vapor pressure deficit, precipitation, solar radiation, crop coefficient data followed by Sc1. The created models produced comparatively superior outcomes and can contribute to the decision-making process for water management and development planners.","",https://doi.org/10.22541/au.167220566.65937696/v1,"",,

The spatio-temporal resolution and survey responsiveness afforded by these low-cost platforms enables the collection of data that can provide insights on the spatio-temporal dynamics of individual marine animals at close range (Anderson & Gaston, 2013). In the last decade there has been an increase in marine studies utilizing UAVs (Schofield et al., 2019), which allows for novel insights on the abundance (Hodgson et al., 2017), behavior (Fiori et al., 2020; Torres et al., 2018), and body condition (Christiansen et al., 2016; Hodgson et al., 2020) of marine wildlife. Importantly, UAV-based image capture has the potential to increase the duration of visible observation through detection of animals below the water surface (Torres et al., 2018). This has significant ramifications for the study of mother-calf humpback whale groups that rest in shallow protected embayments (Bruce et al., 2014; McCulloch et al., 2021), spending high proportions of time resting at depths of <5 m (Bejder et al., 2019; Iwata et al., 2021). However, the use of remotely sensed data in coastal environments is challenged by the optical complexity of the water column (Figure 1). Research until now has focused primarily on image detection based on the visual spectrum with limited evaluation of conventional remote sensing methods for enhancing observation of whales. Processing techniques are commonly used in remote sensing research to enhance or enable the detection of underwater features, including benthic habitat (Hedley et al., 2016; Mumby et al., 1998; Zoffoli et al., 2014). Similar techniques, including water column correction, can be applied to UAV-captured images to enhance visibility of animals below the water surface, which may be missed in manual counts or automated deep-learning based classifications (Gray et al., 2019). This paper presents remote sensing-based methods for enhancing UAV-acquired visual image data to improve the contrast of whales on the water surface and submerged near the surface. Application of these methods has the potential to reduce perception error (Colefax et al., 2018) and subsequently improve detection rates. The Jervis Bay Marine Park study site on the eastern Australian coastline is frequented by humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) mother-calf groups during the southern migration from the breeding grounds (Bruce et al., 2014; Jones, 2019). FIGURE 1Open in figure viewerPowerPoint Diagram illustrating the various processes contributing to complexities in surveying large marine species from a UAV platform. Created with BioRender (https://biorender.com/). The visible RGB imaging capabilities of sensors for detecting whales were evaluated using a DJI Mavic 2 Enterprise Dual (M2ED) launched from a small boat in Jervis Bay. Following a confirmed whale sighting, the whale's behavior and direction of travel were observed for 5 min from the boat at a distance >300 m before an approach was made to a distance >100 m from the whale. The UAV was launched to an initial altitude of 55 m to provide sufficient sensor field of view for whale identification and lowered to ≥25 m once whale(s) were visible on the controller screen. The boat remained at a distance >100 m from the whales during the flights to provide a visual line of sight to the UAV and facilitate positioning over the whales. Still images and videos were captured throughout each flight. Lyzenga's water column correction (Lyzenga, 1981) as modified by Mumby et al. (1998) and Hamylton (2011) was applied to three UAV images containing humpback whales (steps summarized in Figure 2). To enhance the spectral signature of the whale, radiance values were taken from transects along and across the whale's body surface to account for the fusiform shape of the whale (Step 3, Figure 2). This method, suitable for high clarity water, produces a depth-invariant band based on each pair of spectral (wavelength) bands (Mumby et al., 1998). This generated three depth invariant bands from the available spectral band pairs (red/green, red/blue, green/blue). To allow for comparison between the original image and processed images, all pixels were converted into Z-scores (Z = [pixel value − mean]/standard deviation), enabling detection of anomalies. The performance of the applied image processing methods was assessed visually (Figure 3), and quantitively by evaluating the mean Z-score values (Table 1) extracted across the whale's surface for the original RGB images and the three resulting band pairs. FIGURE 2Open in figure viewerPowerPoint Overview of processing steps applied in the depth invariant analysis. In Step 3, the yellow transect outlines where the radiance values were extracted for inclusion in the correction. The correction process resulted in three depth-invariant band pairs. These images were then converted into Z-scores and transects (black dotted line, Step 4) were extracted along the length of the whale to determine average values for each image. FIGURE 3Open in figure viewerPowerPoint Results of depth-invariant processing for three UAV images.

The results from the RGB image are presented as individual red, green, and blue bands. The highest value for each image is shown in bold.

For whales on or just below the surface, the red/green and red/blue depth-invariant band pairs were the most effective band pair combination for enhancing contrast between the whale and surrounding waters, both visually (Figure 3A and C) and resulting in the highest anomaly values (Table 1). The effectiveness of the red band for animals on or near the surface is consistent with findings from Colefax et al. (2021), who demonstrated the red band produced the greatest spectral contrast for detecting dolphins, sharks, and other marine fauna from a UAV. At increasing depths, the green/blue band pair produced a stronger visual contrast and highest anomaly result (Figure 3B; Table 1) owing to the red waveband becoming attenuated at greater depth. The depth of the target animal(s) will influence the optimal band pairing and subsequent object enhancement within the image. The red band (610–700 nm), and other bands with wavelengths approaching the red end of the spectrum (e.g., red edge and near infrared), will become fully attenuated around 2–3 m depth (Hamylton, 2011; Mishra et al., 2005). Thus, the effectiveness of band pairs using the red band will be substantially reduced at this depth. However, in turbid waters, where sightability below the surface is limited, longer wavelength bands may be optimal for increasing the contrast of animals just below the surface (Colefax et al., 2021). Image enhancement methods for improving whale detection rates even in optically shallow waters (<2–3 m) has important implications for studies reliant on whale visibility, such as estimating abundance (e.g., Hodgson et al., 2017). This is key for research conducted on breeding/resting grounds, with lactating females and their calves spending over 50% of time within 3 m of the surface (Bejder et al., 2019). The methods presented here have the potential to increase the confidence of machine learning and automated detection models. Machine learning techniques for automated detection of whales are increasingly being applied to UAV-collected data sets providing an efficient way to process large amounts of data. Studies using machine learning to detect individual animals or plants rely on the detection of target objects against mostly homogenous backgrounds which typically rely on a clear contrast to reliably discriminate animals from their surrounding environment (Laliberte & Ripple, 2003). The use of machine learning for detecting marine vertebrates is further complicated by coloration similarities between some species and the surrounding water (e.g., blue whales; Gray et al., 2019) and nonuniform backgrounds that are subject to varying environmental conditions. In ecological studies, object-based image analysis (OBIA) is the most commonly used machine learning method (Dujon & Schofield, 2019). It provides versatility for detecting objects in varied backgrounds with confounding features, objects that vary in size and shape, and may be sparsely distributed in the image data set (Chabot et al., 2018), making it ideal for abundance and distribution studies. Importantly, even with increased flexibility over other machine learning methods, OBIA is still reliant on the object(s) of interest in the image being localized from surrounding pixels through a local brightness contrast, either as a relatively brighter or relatively darker group of image pixels (Groom et al., 2013). For whale detection, increasing the anomaly (Z-score) of the whale object, as demonstrated here, could potentially improve OBIA-derived results and increase detection availability. Here we have demonstrated that water column correction techniques can enhance the visual outline and anomaly signal over the body of whales on the surface and submerged at shallow depths. However, we recognize constraints associated with the limited spectral resolution provided when working with three bands (i.e., red, green, and blue) within the visible range (wavelength 400–700 nm). Employing multispectral or hyperspectral sensors and customizing or selecting bands configured to focus on wavelength bands optimal for the spectral characteristics of the water body, such as the coastal band (Fretwell et al., 2014), and target species may further reduce perception bias and subsequently improve animal availability at depth compared to standard RGB sensors (Colefax et al., 2018). Additionally, obtaining a larger image data set is critical for understanding the effectiveness of depth invariant indices derived from possible band pairs, and whether these differ with the whale depth and environmental factors (e.g., turbidity). Ultimately, an understanding of the role of water column attenuation correction is critical for accurate detection of whales and is particularly relevant with the increasing use of low-cost UAV platforms and machine learning techniques for achieving estimates of population abundance and monitoring movement patterns of marine wildlife in shallow coastal habitats.

Mean Z-scores Image A Image B Image C Red 1.00 0.85 0.40 Green −0.28 0.90 0.07 Blue −0.45 0.54 −0.08 Red/green 2.21 0.67 1.85 Red/blue 2.11 1.05 1.88 Green/blue 0.32 1.64 1.25 Application of Lyzenga's water column correction enhanced the contrast and edge definition between whales and surrounding water in the three UAV-captured images presented here. For whales on or just below the surface, the red/green and red/blue depth-invariant band pairs were the most effective band pair combination for enhancing contrast between the whale and surrounding waters, both visually (Figure 3A and C) and resulting in the highest anomaly values (Table 1). The effectiveness of the red band for animals on or near the surface is consistent with findings from Colefax et al. (2021), who demonstrated the red band produced the greatest spectral contrast for detecting dolphins, sharks, and other marine fauna from a UAV. At increasing depths, the green/blue band pair produced a stronger visual contrast and highest anomaly result (Figure 3B; Table 1) owing to the red waveband becoming attenuated at greater depth. The depth of the target animal(s) will influence the optimal band pairing and subsequent object enhancement within the image. The red band (610–700 nm), and other bands with wavelengths approaching the red end of the spectrum (e.g., red edge and near infrared), will become fully attenuated around 2–3 m depth (Hamylton, 2011; Mishra et al., 2005). Thus, the effectiveness of band pairs using the red band will be substantially reduced at this depth. However, in turbid waters, where sightability below the surface is limited, longer wavelength bands may be optimal for increasing the contrast of animals just below the surface (Colefax et al., 2021). Image enhancement methods for improving whale detection rates even in optically shallow waters (<2–3 m) has important implications for studies reliant on whale visibility, such as estimating abundance (e.g., Hodgson et al., 2017). This is key for research conducted on breeding/resting grounds, with lactating females and their calves spending over 50% of time within 3 m of the surface (Bejder et al., 2019). The methods presented here have the potential to increase the confidence of machine learning and automated detection models. Machine learning techniques for automated detection of whales are increasingly being applied to UAV-collected data sets providing an efficient way to process large amounts of data. Studies using machine learning to detect individual animals or plants rely on the detection of target objects against mostly homogenous backgrounds which typically rely on a clear contrast to reliably discriminate animals from their surrounding environment (Laliberte & Ripple, 2003). The use of machine learning for detecting marine vertebrates is further complicated by coloration similarities between some species and the surrounding water (e.g., blue whales; Gray et al., 2019) and nonuniform backgrounds that are subject to varying environmental conditions. In ecological studies, object-based image analysis (OBIA) is the most commonly used machine learning method (Dujon & Schofield, 2019). It provides versatility for detecting objects in varied backgrounds with confounding features, objects that vary in size and shape, and may be sparsely distributed in the image data set (Chabot et al., 2018), making it ideal for abundance and distribution studies. Importantly, even with increased flexibility over other machine learning methods, OBIA is still reliant on the object(s) of interest in the image being localized from surrounding pixels through a local brightness contrast, either as a relatively brighter or relatively darker group of image pixels (Groom et al., 2013). For whale detection, increasing the anomaly (Z-score) of the whale object, as demonstrated here, could potentially improve OBIA-derived results and increase detection availability. Here we have demonstrated that water column correction techniques can enhance the visual outline and anomaly signal over the body of whales on the surface and submerged at shallow depths. However, we recognize constraints associated with the limited spectral resolution provided when working with three bands (i.e., red, green, and blue) within the visible range (wavelength 400–700 nm). Employing multispectral or hyperspectral sensors and customizing or selecting bands configured to focus on wavelength bands optimal for the spectral characteristics of the water body, such as the coastal band (Fretwell et al., 2014), and target species may further reduce perception bias and subsequently improve animal availability at depth compared to standard RGB sensors (Colefax et al., 2018). Additionally, obtaining a larger image data set is critical for understanding the effectiveness of depth invariant indices derived from possible band pairs, and whether these differ with the whale depth and environmental factors (e.g., turbidity). Ultimately, an understanding of the role of water column attenuation correction is critical for accurate detection of whales and is particularly relevant with the increasing use of low-cost UAV platforms and machine learning techniques for achieving estimates of population abundance and monitoring movement patterns of marine wildlife in shallow coastal habitats.

This requires innovative and sustainable solutions for monitoring water quality and remediation. This perspective explores the potential of innovative analytical solutions to address this challenge. We highlight the critical role of multimodal analytical and spectroscopy techniques, lab-on-chip technologies, and AI-powered sensing in enhancing detection of contaminants. These advancements offer greater precision and efficiency in water quality management. Beyond detection, sustainable remediation solutions such as phytoremediation and nanotechnology embracing sustainable techniques can minimize environmental impact while fostering a harmonious relationship with natural ecosystems. In addition, effective policy frameworks are essential for facilitating the adoption of these advancements. Regulatory frameworks should align with sustainability goals to ensure that innovative solutions are effectively integrated into national water management strategies. The collaboration among government agencies, research institutions, industry stakeholders, and civil society is necessary to create an enabling environment for the widespread adoption of sustainable water quality management practices. In conclusion, achieving sustainable water quality in Malaysia requires a multifaceted approach that is focused on innovation, sustainability, and collaboration. By harnessing these forces, Malaysia can overcome the challenges posed by emerging contaminants and ensure clean water resources for future generations.","",https://doi.org/10.1021/acsestwater.4c00510,"",,
rayyan-224207236,Spatial Modeling of Groundwater Level in Bangladesh Using Physio-Climatic Variables: Machine Learning and Statistical Approaches,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract Groundwater monitoring is essential for sustainable groundwater resource management in a country like Bangladesh, where this precious resource is gradually declining due overextraction. Acquiring groundwater level (GWL) over a large area is time-consuming and expensive. This study proposes an alternative approach to groundwater monitoring using freely available daily groundwater storage (GWS) gridded data of the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) with other freely available data, including population, rainfall, temperature, irrigation, elevation for modeling GWL data of Bangladesh with a spatial resolution of 0.25 o × 0.25 o . This was accomplished by employing multiple linear regression (MLR) and artificial neural networks (ANN), using weekly in-situ GWL data at 844 locations distributed over Bangladesh. The results showed the inability of GWS data to estimate the country's groundwater spatial variability and trend. The relative performance of MLR and ANN models revealed a higher capability of ANN in estimating GWL from GWS and other data with an overall correlation coefficient (R) of 0.95 and mean squared error (MSE) of 0.64. The study revealed population and rainfall have the most decisive influence in determining GWL. The model developed using ANN can be used to estimate GWL at locations where observation data are unavailable and thus monitor GWL for sustainable groundwater management.","",https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-2261689/v1,"",,
rayyan-224207247,Global flood projection and socioeconomic implications under a physics-constrained deep learning framework,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"As the planet warms, the frequency and severity of weather-related hazards such as floods are intensifying, posing substantial threats to communities around the globe. Rising flood peaks and volumes can claim lives, damage infrastructure, and compromise access to essential services. However, the physical mechanisms behind global flood evolution are still uncertain, and their implications for socioeconomic systems remain unclear. In this study, we leverage a supervised machine learning technique to identify the dominant factors influencing daily streamflow. We then propose a physics-constrained cascade model chain which assimilates water and heat transport processes to project bivariate risk (i.e. flood peak and volume together), along with its socioeconomic consequences. To achieve this, we drive a hybrid deep learning-hydrological model with bias-corrected outputs from twenty global climate models (GCMs) under four shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs). Our results project considerable increases in flood risk under the medium to high-end emission scenario (SSP3-7.0) over most catchments of the globe. The median future joint return period decreases from 50 years to around 27.6 years, with 186 trillion dollars and 4 billion people exposed. Downwelling shortwave radiation is identified as the dominant factor driving changes in daily streamflow, accelerating both terrestrial evapotranspiration and snowmelt. As future scenarios project enhanced radiation levels along with an increase in precipitation extremes, a heightened risk of widespread flooding is foreseen. This study aims to provide valuable insights for policymakers developing strategies to mitigate the risks associated with river flooding under climate change.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu24-4105,"",,
rayyan-224207263,Terrestrial Water Storage Reconstruction: A Causal Inference Approach,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"The water availability in a region is driven by the water cycle, which is changing quickly in response to climate change and direct human interventions. The water cycle is defined and controlled by the variation in water fluxes such as Precipitation (P), Evapotranspiration (Et), Runoff (R), and Storage change (&amp;#916;S). Out of these water fluxes, &amp;#916;S is a key variable for ecosystem habitability and surviving droughts. It is an important parameter in drafting water management policy, but due to lack of long and reliable data the impact of climate change on &amp;#916;S is yet to be understood. The only Global observations of Terrestrial water storage (TWS) are available from GRACE satellite mission since 2002 at monthly scale. Although GRACE data has transformed hydrological science significantly, its short time series limits usage of GRACE for climate change analysis of hydrological fluxes (closing the multidecadal water budget and sea level budget, understanding the spatiotemporal evolution of water availability, and so on). To tackle this, several studies have attempted reconstructing &amp;#916;S prior to GRACE period. These studies employ either hydrological modelling of &amp;#916;S, statistical regression, &amp;#160;or machine learning techniques. While machine learning methods have been assessed superior, they suffer from issues such as a lack of explainability, failure to identify causal drivers of TWS change, and use of short time series for feature extraction and training leading to poor or no representation of decadal natural variability. Furthermore, in all the studies till now, representation of local human activities, such as ground water extraction or reservoir operation, &amp;#160;was either absent or assumed to be a linear trend. Here we revisit a reconstruction method by Humphrey et al., 2017 and show that these approximations have a considerable impact on the quality of reconstruction. Then we propose a multivariate regression model that relates selected hydrometeorological variables with TWS. These variables are identified from causal analysis of JULES model outputs. We show that temperature has a very weak relation with TWS compared to precipitation. The causal inference based model is able to capture realistic variability in reconstructed TWS. Our TWS reconstruction for the Ganges basin outperforms the contemporary attempts and is able to identify the drivers for interannual changes in TWS . The results bring historical perspective to the current state of water resources in the basin and provide context for design of future water resources policy.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu24-971,"",,
rayyan-224207290,Determination and Evapotranspiration of different Agro-climatic regions of India by Artificial Neural Network,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract Climate change has a tremendous effect on the evapotranspiration (ET) process worldwide and the computation of ET for various climatic regions is essential for efficient water management. ET was estimated using Artificial Neural Network models for 10 stations falling under different agro-climatic regions of India. Although the Penman–Monteith ET model has superior predictive ability than the other methods, owing to the need for a large number of climatic variables, it is difficult to use in data-short conditions and it is necessary to determine the most important climatic variables for the agro-climatic regions. Most sensitive climatic variables were identified from the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for all the stations. Sensitivity analysis showed that the overall average change in ET 0 values for 25% change in the climatic variables were 18%, 16%, 14%, 7%, 5%, 4% respectively for T max , RH mean, R n, Wind speed, T min and sunshine hours. New ET models were developed for each station, both with all climatic variables and with the important climatic variables identified by PCA, using the ANN model and compared the performance with Penman–Monteith ET estimates. Net radiation, high and low temperatures, usual relative humidity, wind velocity, and the ratio of daily sunshine hours are all input variables to the model, with ET0 values as an output. Several neurons in the hidden layer for each station for the best model performance were found. PCA variables guaranteed the most reliable estimation of potential evapotranspiration (PET) accounting for 98% of the variability. The average values of coefficient of determination (R 2 ), standard error of estimate (SEE), and percentage efficiency (%) were observed as 0.96, 0.24, 94% respectively. There was no significant difference between the ANN model with all climatic variables and with the PCA variables identified indicating that the ANN model with variables resulting from PCA can be preferred for practical applications.","",https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1574912/v1,"",,
rayyan-224207296,Fast and detailed emulation of urban drainage flows using physics-guided machine learning,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Hydrodynamic models (numerical solutions of the Saint Venant equations) are at the core of simulating water movements in natural streams and drainage systems. They enable realistic simulations of water movement and are directly linked to physical system characteristics such as channel slope and diameter. This feature is important for man-made drainage structures as it enables straightforward testing of the effects of varying channel designs. In cities, models with hundreds up to tens of thousands of pipes are commonly used for drainage infrastructure. Their computational expense remains high and they are not suited for a systematic screening of design options, discussing water management options in workshops, as well as many real-time applications such as data assimilation.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Hydrologists have developed many approaches to enable faster simulations. All of these do, however, compromise on the physical detail of the simulated processes (for example, by simulating only flows using linear reservoirs), and usually also on the spatial and temporal resolution of the models (for example, by simulating only flows between key points in the system). The link to physical system characteristics is thus lost. Therefore, it is challenging to incorporate such approaches into planning workflows where changing city plans require a constant revision of water management options.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Recent advances in scientific machine learning enable the creation of fast machine learning surrogates for complex systems that preserve a high spatio-temporal detail and a physically accurate simulation. We present such an approach that employs generalized residue networks for the simulation of hydraulics in drainage systems. The key concept is to train neural networks that learn how hydraulic states (level, flow and surcharge volume) at all nodes and pipes in the drainage network evolve from one time step to another, given a set of boundary conditions (surface runoff). Training is performed against the output of a hydrodynamic model for a short time series.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Once trained, the surrogates generate the same results as a hydrodynamic model in the same level of detail, and they can be used to quickly simulate the effect of many different rain events and climate scenarios. Considering pipe networks with 50 to 100 pipes, our approach achieves NSE values in the order of 0.95 for the testing dataset. Simulations are performed 10 to 50 times faster than the hydrodynamic model. Training times are in the order of 25 minutes on a single CPU. The surrogates are system specific and need to be retrained when the physical system changes. To minimize this overhead, we train surrogates for small subsystems which can subsequently be linked into a model for a large drainage network.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Our approach is an initial application of scientific machine learning for the simulation of hydraulics that is readily combined with other recent developments. Future research should, in particular, explore the application of physics-informed loss functions for bypassing the generation of training data from hydrodynamic simulations, and of graph neural networks to exploit spatial correlation structures in the pipe network.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu22-4303,"",,
rayyan-224207330,Advancing Water Management in Water-Scarce Regions: A Collaborative Approach for Early Assessment of Irrigation Needs in the Capitanata Consortium (Apulia region).&amp;#160;,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"In water-scarce regions, effective water resource management is crucial for sustainable agriculture. Scientists and decision-makers are working to address issues of resource conservation and agricultural productivity, with a growing interest in coupling hydrological and crop models. The current trend of interest seems to be limited to the improvement of crop system performance and environmental impact assessment, but attention also needs to be paid to sustainable crop production and water management concerns. Driven by these needs, in the framework of I4DP-SCIENCE program, the Italian Space Agency (ASI) supports the ambitious collaborative project THETIS (Earth Observation for the Early forecasT of Irrigation needS; Agreement n. 2023-52-HH.0), involving the National Research Council &amp;#8211; Institute for Electromagnetic Sensing of the Environment (CNR-IREA), the Council for Agricultural Research and Economics (CREA), the Polytechnic of Bari, the University of Bari, and the Reclamation Consortium of the Capitanata, Foggia, Italy. The project focuses on the early assessment and forecasting of irrigation needs in the &amp;#8220;Fortore&amp;#8221; irrigation district in the Apulian Tavoliere (Southern Italy). THETIS aims to develop a Spatial Decision Support System (SDSS) integrating hydrologic and crop growth models with advanced Earth Observation (EO) products, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and a WEBGIS interface to provide basin-scale information for the efficient planning of irrigation resources for three different use cases (i.e., early forecasting, irrigation start and mid-season estimation) for different target crops. The project architecture significantly relies on the use of EO derived products obtained through the integrated use of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), multispectral and hyperspectral data. They serve the purpose of describing land surface processes and represent crucial parameters for hydrological and crop growth model constraints. Specifically, the calibration of the hydrological model spans from summer 2021 to autumn 2022. The subsequent phase will include a validation phase (year 2023) and an operational phase to estimate water use for the upcoming irrigation season. The validation of the model outputs includes the comparison of the estimated water demand with the actual irrigation volumes applied by the Consortium. A primary focus of the proposed architecture lies in generating time-series estimates of root zone soil moisture, essential for defining the initial conditions in the crop growth model AquaCrop which plays a pivotal role in managing the water balance at the field scale in the areas relevant to irrigation needs assessment. To achieve this goal, the project aims to integrate, for the first time, a revised version of the well-known daily basin-scale hydrological model DREAM with the physically based Soil Moisture Accounting and Routing (SMAR) model. This work concerns data selection and assessment for calibration and validation phases of the basin-scale hydrological model and the SMAR model. They include sparse daily field measurements and satellite data retrievals. Although field monitoring remains essential, preliminary results regarding the use of satellite-derived and downscaled products for a proper model calibration are encouraging. The proposed approach shows promise for providing insights into soil dynamics for operational implementation, supporting advances in sustainable agricultural techniques and rational water resource management in semi-arid environments.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu24-18407,"",,
rayyan-224207372,"Upscaling dryland carbon and water fluxes with artificial neural networks of optical, thermal, and microwave satellite remote sensing",,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract. Earth’s drylands are home to more than two billion people, provide key ecosystem services, and exert a large influence on the trends and variability in Earth’s carbon cycle. However, modeling dryland carbon and water fluxes with remote sensing suffers from unique challenges not typically encountered in mesic systems, particularly in capturing soil moisture stress. Here, we develop and evaluate an approach for joint modeling of dryland gross primary production (GPP), net ecosystem exchange (NEE), and evapotranspiration (ET) in the western United States (U.S.) using a suite of AmeriFlux eddy covariance sites spanning major functional types and aridity regimes. We use artificial neural networks (ANNs) to predict dryland ecosystem fluxes by fusing optical vegetation indices, multitemporal thermal observations, and microwave soil moisture/temperature retrievals from the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) sensor. Our new dryland ANN (DrylANNd) carbon and water flux model explains more than 70 % of monthly variance in GPP and ET, improving upon existing MODIS GPP and ET estimates at most dryland eddy covariance sites. DrylANNd predictions of NEE were considerably worse than its predictions of GPP and ET, likely because soil and plant respiratory processes are largely invisible to satellite sensors. Optical vegetation indices, particularly the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and near-infrared reflectance of vegetation (NIRv), were generally the most important variables contributing to model skill. However, daytime and nighttime land surface temperatures and SMAP soil moisture and soil temperature also contributed to model skill, with SMAP especially improving model predictions of shrubland, grassland, and savanna fluxes and land surface temperatures improving predictions in evergreen needleleaf forests. Our results show that a combination of optical vegetation indices, thermal infrared, and microwave observations can substantially improve estimates of carbon and water fluxes in drylands, potentially providing the means to better monitor vegetation function and ecosystem services in these important regions that are undergoing rapid hydroclimatic change.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-2022-186,"",,
rayyan-224207418,A WEF NEXUS tool for integrating soil moisture and meteorological IoT data.,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"According to the European Parliamentary Research Service, agriculture is a major user of ground and surface water in the Mediterranean region. Agriculture accounts for more than 40% of water use in the EU and most freshwater abstraction is for agricultural use. Water applied as irrigation enables crop production in arid regions and replenishes soil moisture in humid regions when rainfall during the growing season is insufficient. It helps to increase crop productivity, but it also poses a threat to the conservation of water resources. The issue of water scarcity therefore requires careful consideration of the trade-off between increased agricultural productivity and the degradation of water resources. Ensuring food security in the face of climate change requires improved water management capacity. Nowadays, the interest in estimating the average soil moisture content (SM) and its variability is a cross-cutting issue in many areas of scientific research in the natural sciences. The water contained and transiting in the vadose zone is involved in and plays a central role in many natural processes related to plant physiology and agriculture, soil microbial activity, groundwater pollution and, more generally, eco-hydrological and bio-geochemical processes. SM depends either on soil characteristics, i.e. hydraulic conductivity, porosity, soil texture, etc., or on meteorological forcing, i.e. precipitation, temperature, evapotranspiration, etc. Knowing the soil characteristics, a numerical model for unsaturated flow (Hydrus-1D) can be calibrated using time-lapse measurements of meteorological forcing and SMs obtained by IoT enabled sensors. After the calibration, the numerical model can generate a very large number of SMs for many meteorological forcings. With these data, a WEF Nexus tool, based on a machine learning approach, integrates the SM and meteorological IoT data to estimate crop water demand. This research aims to develop and test a building block for possible future water demand estimation tools. As a future perspective, further development and integration may lead to new tools with user-friendly interfaces.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu24-8914,"",,
rayyan-224207421,Hybrid Drought Forecasting Framework for Water‐Scarce Regions Based on Support Vector Machine and Precipitation Index,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"ABSTRACT Drought is a natural event that slowly deteriorates water reserves. This study aims to develop a machine learning–based computational framework for monitoring drought status in water‐scarce regions. The proposed framework integrates the precipitation index (PI) with support vector machine models to forecast drought occurrences based on an autoregressive modelling scheme. Due to the suitability of the PI for drought analysis in arid climates, the developed hybrid model is appropriate in regions with limited rainfall. This study used a historical precipitation dataset from 1958 to 2020 at the Kuwait International Airport, Kuwait City. The study area is characterised by scarce rainfall and is vulnerable to severe water shortages owing to limited water resources. Initially, historical PI time‐series datasets were examined for stationarity to validate the utility of the autoregressive model. The autocorrelation function test was significantly associated with the PI time series at the 12‐ and 24‐month drought‐monitoring scales. Predictive drought forecasting models were constructed to predict drought occurrences up to 3 months in advance. Statistical evaluation metrics were used to assess model performance for the 12‐ and 24‐month drought‐monitoring scales. The results showed a strong association between the observed and predicted drought events, with coefficients of determination ( R 2 ) ranging between 0.865 and 0.925 for the 12‐ and 24‐month drought‐monitoring scales. The proposed computational framework aims to provide water managers in arid and water‐scarce regions with efficient and reliable drought‐monitoring tools to assist in preparing appropriate water management plans. This study provides guidance for improving water resource resilience under water shortage scenarios in the study area and other climatic regions by applying suitable drought indices in conjunction with robust data‐driven models. The results provide a baseline for water resource policymakers worldwide to establish sustainable water conservation strategies and provide crucial insights for drought disaster preparation.","",https://doi.org/10.1002/hyp.70031,"",,

Annually, significant increasing trends are identified for western catchments. In winter, significant increasing trends dominate the western seaboard, with decreasing trends in the southeast. Few significant trends are found in spring and summer, while autumn shows significant increasing trends in northern catchments. Months with the largest number of significant increasing trends are January, November and December. Trend persistence was evaluated by dropping the start year of analysis, with winter showing the most persistent trends across the record. Introduction Analysis of trends in historical river flows furthers understanding of variability and change for water management. In the United Kingdom (UK), Harrigan et al. (2018) examined trends in river flows finding increasing trends in autumn and winter, decreases in spring and contrasting northwest/southeast increasing/decreasing patterns in summer. In Ireland, Murphy et al. (2013) assessed trends in observed flows for 43 Irish catchments over the period 1976–2009, identifying decreasing trends in winter and spring flows and increasing trends in summer. However, such analyses can be hampered by short record lengths (e.g. Wilby, 2006; Slater et al., 2021). In Europe, which has amongst the longest and most spatially dense flow records (Brönnimann et al., 2019), average record length is 54 years (Mangini et al., 2018). In Ireland, flow records typically commenced in the 1970s in response to severe drought at the time (Murphy et al., 2013), with only a handful of gauges extending to earlier periods. Consequently, researchers have attempted to reconstruct flows to extend observed records and improve understanding of variability and change (e.g. Jones et al., 2006; Spraggs et al., 2015; Brigode et al., 2016; Smith et al., 2019). Here, we employ monthly flow reconstructions developed by O'Connor et al. (2021) for Irish catchments to assess trends in annual, seasonal and monthly mean flows and examine the sensitivity of trends to the period of record analysed. Data and methods Study catchments and flow data Trends in flow reconstructions were found for 51 catchments across Ireland (see Table 1 for details of the flow stations and related catchment meteorological and hydrometric data). For a full background on how the monthly flows were reconstructed, see O'Connor et al. (2021). In brief, catchment precipitation and evapotranspiration were derived by bias correcting Casty et al.'s (2007) gridded (0.5°× 0.5°) precipitation and temperature datasets and used as inputs to a conceptual rainfall–runoff model and artificial neural network to simulate monthly flows for the past 250 years for each catchment. The median simulation from across hydrological modelling approaches is employed here. Given large uncertainties in pre-1900 reconstructions, only data from 1900 to 2016 were used, with the choice of end year (i.e. 2016) determined by the availability of concurrent hydrological and meteorological data. Annual, seasonal (winter (DJF), spring (MAM), summer (JJA), and autumn (SON)) and monthly mean flow indices were extracted for all 51 catchments. Table 1. Details of the 51 study catchments. As well as overall flow station data, catchment area (km2), Standard period Average Annual Rainfall (SAAR) and annual runoff (mm) are displayed. Rows are ordered by SAAR values from lowest (blue) to highest (red) with similar colouring applied to annual runoff to allow for visual comparisons between values.

The non-parametric Theil–Sen's slope (Theil, 1950; Sen, 1968) estimator was also derived to evaluate the magnitude of trends. Trends were evaluated in two ways. First, we use a fixed period of analysis (1900–2016) to examine trends over the full period. Slope magnitudes and directions for each catchment, at annual, seasonal and monthly timescales were calculated and mapped to identify regional patterns. Second, we examine the persistence of trends, or their dependency on the period of record analysed, by sequentially dropping the start year of analysis, to a minimum record length of 16 years, which provided a sufficient length of time to identify an accurate trend in the data whilst allowing all twentieth century values to be contained within the analysis. For each catchment and indicator, the resultant series of MK Z values were plotted and examined. Results Annual and seasonal trends Figure 1 plots trend magnitude and significance for annual mean flows for the full period of record. Increasing trends predominate, with the exception of catchments in the southeast. Large and significant increasing trends are found for western, northern and southwestern catchments. By examining trend persistence (Figure 2), it is apparent that such large increasing trends are only evident for long records. For tests commencing post 1970, few significant trends are evident. Figure 1Open in figure viewerPowerPoint Theil–Sen slope estimates for mean annual flows for the 51 study catchments for the period 1900–2016. Trend directions are indicated by arrowhead direction and colour, with arrowhead size representative of slope magnitude. Significant trends, at the 0.05 level, are indicated using white triangles. Figure 2Open in figure viewerPowerPoint Persistence of trends (sequentially varying start year of Mann–Kendall tests) for annual mean flows. Grey lines represent MK Z scores for each of the 51 study catchments. Trends for median flow values (black) across all 51 catchments are also displayed. Dashed red lines at +1.96/−1.96 represent thresholds above/below which trends are significant at the 0.05 level. Seasonal trends for the full period are plotted in Figure 3. For winter, significant increasing trends are found for catchments in the northwest and along the Atlantic seaboard. Large increasing trends are also evident in the southwest but not significant at the 0.05 level. In the east and southeast decreasing trends in winter mean flows are evident, some of which are significant. For winter, in catchments showing increasing trends, these are relatively consistent irrespective of the period of record analysed (Figure 4), however significant increasing trends are more common in longer records. While trend tests commencing from the 1970s onwards generally show increases, they tend to be weaker and non-significant compared to those found in longer records. Figure 3Open in figure viewerPowerPoint As per Figure 1 but for seasonal mean flows. Figure 4Open in figure viewerPowerPoint As per Figure 2 but for seasonal mean flows. Spring is marked by an absence of significant trends for the fixed period 1900–2016. Broadly speaking, the western half of the country tends to show increasing trends, largest in the northwest, while the eastern half of the country shows weak decreasing trends. However, trends in spring mean flows (Figure 4) are highly sensitive to the period of record analysed. Tests commencing in the 1920s and 1930s show large and significant increasing trends for many catchments. Conversely, tests commencing in the mid-1970s show widespread decreasing trends, often significant, across catchments. Like spring, summer shows a marked absence of significant trends for the 1900–2016 fixed period (Figure 3). Most catchments show weak (non-significant) decreasing trends, with some catchments in the upper Shannon basin showing weak (non-significant) increasing trends. Even the direction of trends in summer mean flows is dependent on the period of record analysed (Figure 4). Tests commencing prior to 1920 show a predominance of decreasing, non-significant trends. Tests commencing after ~1970, the period concurrent with available observed records, tend to show increasing trends in summer mean flows across most catchments. In autumn, large and significant increasing trends are found for catchments in the northwest and north and for some catchments in the southwest for the fixed period 1900–2016. The remainder of catchments tends to show weak (non-significant) increasing trends, with the exception of catchments in the southeast where weak (non-significant) decreasing trends are apparent. Trends in autumn flows are, in general, of a consistent direction for test start years commencing prior to the 1970s. For tests commencing after the 1970s, there is a greater tendency towards negative trends, with many catchments showing significantly decreasing trends for tests commencing post 1995. Monthly trends Trends in monthly flows for the fixed period 1900–2016 are presented in Figure 5. For winter months, December shows significant increasing trends in northwestern catchments. The number and spatial extent of significant increasing trends increases in January with catchments across the north, northwest and along a considerable portion of the west coast all showing significant (increasing) trends. Large increasing trends are also evident in February but are not significant. In each winter month, catchments in the east and southeast show non-significant decreasing trends. For spring months, March shows the largest trends, with increases in the west and decreases in the east, however only two catchments (north and northwest) show significant increasing trends. For April and May, trends are weak and non-significant, with no clear spatial patterns. For summer months, June shows weak (non-significant) increasing trends across all catchments (significant for one catchment in the south). Both July and August flows are dominated by decreasing, mostly non-significant, trends. Largest decreasing trends are found for August in the southwest and west, with four catchments in the southwest and southeast showing significant decreases. For autumn months, trends are dominated by increases. September shows the greatest diversity of trends with large, though non-significant, increasing trends in the northwest, and weak decreasing trends in the east and southeast. Both October and November are dominated by increasing trends, particularly the latter, whereby catchments in the southwest show significant increases over the fixed period 1900–2016. Figure 5Open in figure viewerPowerPoint As per Figure 1 but for monthly mean flows. Figure 6 evaluates the persistence of trends in monthly mean flows for varying start years. While all months show sensitivity of results to the period used to assess trends, the months where trends are most sensitive to start year are March, April, July, August, September and October. In March, long-term records tend to return increasing trends (significant for tests commencing in the 1920s and 1930s). By contrast, tests commencing in the 1970s return significant decreasing trends. Similar results are obtained for April, with tests commencing in the mid-1980s returning significant decreasing trends for many catchments, while tests commencing in the first half of the twentieth century return large (often significant) increasing trends. July and August show similar results, with tests commencing in the early record dominated by decreasing trends, whereas tests commencing in the late 1960s typically return large (often significant) increasing trends. In September, tests commencing between 1920 and 1960 show widespread decreasing trends across catchments, while tests commencing after 1960 show weak increasing and decreasing trends across catchments. Finally for October, tests commencing after 1970 tend to show large, often significant, decreasing trends, while tests commencing prior to the 1970 largely show increasing trends across catchments. These results highlight the importance of record length and again emphasise that the period of available observations is often unrepresentative of long-term trends in monthly flows.

Discussion This research investigated annual, seasonal and monthly trends in reconstructed flows for 51 Irish catchments over the period 1900–2016. We find increasing trends in annual flows in the northwest, west and southwest. Our seasonal assessment found increases in autumn and winter flows consistent with those found for precipitation by McElwain and Sweeney (2003) and Murphy et al. (2018). Seasonal trends are also consistent with Murphy et al. (2013) for respective periods of records. Our monthly assessment confirmed seasonal findings, with prominent increasing trends evident in western catchments during the winter half year (October–March). Our study shows the large variability in mean flows across Ireland. We find a change in the direction of trends in the mid-1970s, particularly in annual and spring mean flows. Ryan et al. (2021) found significant breakpoints between 1976 and 1979 for annual precipitation totals in their assessment of long-term trends in Irish precipitation. Similarly, Murphy et al. (2018) identified a step change in 1976 in their 1711–2016 rainfall series for Ireland. Both studies attribute this change to a switch to a predominantly positive phase of the North Atlantic Oscillation in the mid-1970s, previously noted in Ireland by Kiely (1999) and at a European scale by Lorenzo-Lacruz et al. (2022). Furthermore, McCarthy et al. (2015) highlight the influence of the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) on summer precipitation in Ireland. Future research should prioritise investigating AMO influence on summer flows using these long-term reconstructions, with potential insights being useful for decadal forecasting and water management. Our findings highlight the sensitivity of trends to the period of record examined. For annual, spring and summer mean flows, trends in reconstructions for the period concurrent with observations were often unrepresentative of long-term trends. This highlights the importance of flow reconstructions for contextualising findings from shorter observed records. Reconstructions are subject to uncertainty, principally from the hydrological models employed and the underlying precipitation data (O'Connor et al., 2021). Close inspection of reconstructed and observed flows by O'Connor et al. (2021) and agreement between our results and those found in other studies suggest that our results are reliable. Finally, assessment of climate change impacts on seasonal mean flows for Irish catchments using the CMIP6 ensemble by Meresa et al. (2021, 2022) suggests that anthropogenic climate change is likely to be associated with increases in winter mean flows. This is consistent with trends in winter identified here for the west and northwest. While the direction of change in summer is uncertain, the majority of future simulations suggest substantial decreases. Our results show little evidence of persistent trends in summer flows, while trends commencing in recent decades show a tendency towards increasing summer flows. Future work should further investigate the disparity between observed and simulated changes in summer flows. Similar issues have been raised elsewhere (e.g. Hannaford, 2015). Conclusions This study investigated trends in reconstructed river flows (1900–2016) for 51 catchments across the island of Ireland at annual, seasonal and monthly timescales. For the full period of record increasing trends are evident for annual, winter and autumn mean flows, particularly for catchments in the west and northwest. No significant trends are found for spring and summer mean flows. Analysis of trend persistence by sequentially varying the start year of analysis shows the sensitivity of trend results to the period of record tested. We find that trends in our reconstructions for the period concurrent with observations (typically the 1970s onwards) are often inconsistent with trends from longer records. This highlights the importance of long-term meteorological data in facilitating the development of flow reconstructions for contextualising trends from shorter observed records.

In the past two decades, various statistical and machine-learning techniques have been developed and tested for climate downscaling; however, there is no consensus regarding which technique is the most reliable for climate downscaling and hydrological impact assessment. In this study, an advanced machine-learning technique, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network, is used to build multi-model ensembles for downscaling climate projections from a wide ranges of global and regional climate models, and its performance is compared with a number of traditional statistical and machine-learning methods, such as ensemble average, linear regression, Multi-layer Perceptron, Time-lagged Feed-forward Neural Network, and Nonlinear Auto-regression Network with exogenous inputs. The downscaling input consists of temperature and precipitation projections provided by regional climate models, such as CanRCM4, CRCM5, RCA4, and HIRHAM5, and the output is observation data collected from meteorological stations. Performance of the developed LSTM ensemble is evaluated for two case studies in Canada and China. The downscaled climate projections are further used to assess the hydrological impacts in the southwestern mountainous area in China, with the assist of a fully distributed hydrological model, MIKE SHE. The results can support future applications of LSTM neural networks and other similar data-driven techniques for climate downscaling and hydrological impact assessment.

rayyan-224207633,A distributed rainfall-runoff model for the investigation of climate change effects on river floods in the European Alps,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"The worsening of global climate change has increased both the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, significantly impacting the dynamics of flooding. This convergence of factors results in intensified and prolonged precipitation, leading to river overflow and catastrophic floods. Elevated temperatures and rapid snowpack melting further contribute to the increase of flood risk. These impacts are particularly pronounced in mountainous regions, where the combination of steep terrain and increased precipitation amplifies the risk of flash and snowmelt generated floods. The CLIM2FLEX project aligns with this intricate and evolving context, aiming to assess, under potential climate scenarios, the variations in the frequency and intensity of river floods generated by various mechanisms. Within the project framework, a crucial aspect involves constructing a modeling chain, complete with a hydrological module. This component is dedicated to translating climate inputs into continuous discharge time series, enhancing the project's capacity for in-depth analysis and dynamic modeling. To do so, the main idea is to use a ""new version"" of the ""TUWmodel"" conceptual hydrological model to account for the inter-basin transfer of water and flood waves propagation (from upstream catchments to downstream catchments) through the implementation of a new routing routine based on the introduction of a Nash-Cascade module. Different calibration strategies are used at gauged sites to estimate the best model parameters. A machine learning based regionalization approach (HydroPASS) is then applied to infer model parameters at ungauged sites for hydrological streamflow predictions.&amp;#160; The focus of this study encompasses the entire Great Alpine Region (GAR), posing significant modeling challenges. The region is predominantly characterized by mountainous terrain, consisting mainly of small catchments. Here, the effects of snow accumulation-melting cycles, as well as the presence of glaciers and other small-scale features, play a particularly crucial role. The presentation at EGU will delve into preliminary findings concerning the applicability and reliability of the proposed hydrological modeling chain structure, along with the anticipated future steps in the research.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu24-6458,"",,
rayyan-224207643,WATER4CAST- integrated Forecasting System for Water and the Environment,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Forecast-informed decision-making has been proven to improve water management. However, the practical implementation of such systems need to account for a wide range of processes and variables with the proper spatiotemporal resolution at the regional and local levels (meteorological, hydrological, agronomic, reservoir management and ecosystems). Furthermore, forecasts need to cover all the relevant temporal scales, from short-term to subseasonal to seasonal, to ensure an integrated approach including from quick emergency responses to strategic operational decisions. In this regard, the project ""Integrated Water and Environmental Forecasting System (WATER4CAST)"" develops an innovative visual decision support system (VDSS) to enable forecast-informed decision-making in the Jucar River Basin (Spain) covering the above processes (https://water4cast-app.upv.es/). The VDSS offers short-term (15 days), subseasonal (8 weeks) and seasonal (6-7 months) forecasts. It includes meteorological (temperature, precipitation, solar radiation, wind), hydrological (streamflow, soil moisture, reservoir inflows), agronomic (potential evapotranspiration, irrigation needs), environmental (habitat for native fish species) and water resource management variables (stored volumes, reservoir releases) and indicators (drought and fire risk). Short-term meteorological forecasts come from the NOAA GFS, while subseasonal predictions are obtained from the NOAA CFS. On the contrary, a multi-model approach is adopted to acknowledge uncertainty in seasonal forecasts, employing predictions from the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S). All raw forecasts are post-processed to correct biases, ensuring their fit to the local climatic patterns of the Jucar River Basin using artificial intelligence (fuzzy logic). Hydrological forecasts are provided by the fully-distributed eco-hydrological model TETIS, properly calibrated and validated for the Jucar. Agronomic forecasts rely on FAO56 agronomic models are tailored to the irrigated areas of the Jucar with the support of remote sensing. Ecosystem forecasts employ fish habitat models that relate streamflows to suitable habitat of native species. Finally, reservoir operation forecasts are provided by a water resource management model whose operating rules are defined using fuzzy rule-based systems. The VDSS consists of two parts: a public part and a private part available to specific users on request for selected variables considered sensible. The VDSS was co-developed with the users of stakeholders of the Jucar River Basin to ensure they account for their needs.

rayyan-224207649,A comprehensive analysis of land use and climate change impacts on water quality in Italian river basins,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"The degradation of water quality, pivotal for sustainable development, is exacerbated by the interconnected impacts of climate change (CC) and land-use/land-cover change (LULCC). Rapid global development has amplified these effects, disrupting key processes that regulate river flows and runoff. LULCC, particularly in agriculture, plays a central role in nutrient cycle and runoff to the water bodies, thus affecting the water quality and ecosystem resilience. Concurrently, climate change intensifies algal blooms, reduces dissolved oxygen, and alters aquatic ecosystems. Shifts in precipitation and rising temperatures amplify pollutant transport and compromise water quality. Moreover, the complex interactions among LULCC and CC have significant impacts on nutrients, pollution concentrations, and sedimentation rates in freshwater ecosystems. This research focuses on the analysis of the dynamics and impacts of LULCC and climate-induced changes on the state of water quality at the river basin scale in Italy, supporting the achievement of good chemical and ecological status of the Water Framework Directive. First, this study aims to analyse LULCC pattern changes across various spatial scales with the use of geoinformation system (GIS) techniques to identify sensitivity and changes at the pixel level within different land use types. This analysis allows the identification of linkages and dependencies between LULCC indicators and their relationships with water quality parameters in each river basin of Italy. Second, to address the compound effects of climate change, this study examines historical patterns of climate change indicators and their correlation with water quality over time. It also investigates the temporal and spatial occurrence of extreme events, which are linked to changes in nutrient and pollutant levels. The final phase of the methodology involves the development of a machine-learning model aiming at understanding and predicting the complex interplay of multiple risk factors such as the combined effects of land-use change, climate variability, and other anthropogenic influences on water quality. By using machine learning techniques, the study will be able to identify intricate patterns and non-linear relationships between multiple risk factors and their collective influence on water quality dynamics. The results will provide a comprehensive understanding required for adaptive measures and decision-making support in Italy.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu24-9619,"",,
rayyan-224207651,Assessing climate change impacts in the Tagus-Segura water transfer (Spain) through artificial intelligence,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Being the most extensive water infrastructure in Spain, the future of the Tagus-Segura interbasin transfer is contested by climate change and increasing controversy regarding its use. It is a crucial infrastructure for regional socioeconomic development since it significantly contributes to the sustainability of one of Europe's most important agricultural areas. Diverse stakeholders' interests have generated conflicts impacting its decision-making processes. Several regulations have established maximum transferable volumes in the last decades depending on water availability and demands in the involved basins. However, the volumes transferred do not only account for those limits but also include expert criteria and&amp;#160;ad-hoc&amp;#160;considerations, making it complex to predict them. Artificial intelligence emerges as an effective solution to address this challenge and to reconcile all the factors affecting its current operating rules.To this end, this contribution combines artificial intelligence (fuzzy logic) with climate change scenarios and hydrological and water resource management models to predict future water transfers from the upper Tagus (donor basin) to the Segura (receiver basin). Climate change scenarios refer to five CMIP6 (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6) climate models and four scenarios: historical (1979-2014), SSP126, SSP370, and SSP585 (2015-2100). Using their meteorological projections, the eco-hydrological model TETIS is used to obtain future time series of streamflows in response to them. The current operation of the water transfer is inferred through fuzzy logic systems that take into account the hydrological discharge of the upper Tagus estimated by TETIS, the storage level of the upper Tagus reservoirs (Entrepe&amp;#241;as and Buendia), the storage levels of the rest of the Tagus and the Segura basins, the regulatory limits, and the month of the year. The results show how foreseen streamflows in the upper Tagus would affect the transfer, providing valuable information for water planning in both basins, particularly in the Segura, for its adaptation to any decrease in water received from the Tagus basin.AcknowledgmentsThis study has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the GoNEXUS project (grant agreement No 101003722); and from the SOS-WATER project under the European Union's Horizon Europe research and innovation programme under grant agreement No. 101059264.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu24-17698,"",,

For various applications &amp;#8211; including monitoring and forecasting of hydro-climatic extremes (floods, droughts), forest fires, and crop yield estimation &amp;#8211; high-resolution SM information is required. Currently, the ESA CCI (Climate Change Initiative) product provides a long-term, global record of SM with daily temporal resolution and a spatial resolution of 25km (0.25&amp;#176;). This coarse resolution can limit its usefulness in some of the mentioned fields of application. This study aims to improve the spatial resolution of the ESA CCI SM product to 1km (0.01&amp;#176;) through machine learning, incorporating dynamic and static ancillary variables influencing the spatial organization of SM at this finer scale. This procedure consists of two steps, in which the coarse resolution data is first downscaled to 0.05&amp;#176; and then further to 0.01&amp;#176;. Currently, the ancillary variables used in the downscaling process consist of land cover information from the Copernicus Global Land Service (CGLS) including soil properties, land cover types, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and a digital elevation model. Recent assessments against in-situ measurements from the International Soil Moisture Network (ISMN) across Europe reveal that the downscaled SM offers a more detailed portrayal of the spatial distribution of SM compared to the original ESA CCI product while retaining the high temporal accuracy. However, these investigations also show that the impact of the NDVI on the model prediction is small. In future iterations of the downscaling model, the goal is to explore possibilities for incorporating more influential variables that achieve greater information gain (e.g. Land surface temperature) and to examine other machine learning approaches in addition to the currently used random forest regressor to further improve the downscaling accuracy.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu24-11026,"",,
rayyan-224207674,Evaluation of Soil Mapping Methods for SWAT Hydrological Modeling through Multi-Objective Calibration,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Soil data is a crucial component for hydrological models operating at the catchment scale, such as the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). Nevertheless, the reliability of these models is heavily contingent upon the quality and spatial resolution of the soil information employed. This study addresses the pressing need for robust soil data in SWAT modeling by evaluating various soil mapping techniques.The first objective was to prove different mapping techniques, such as textural class combination and clustering approach using soil grid data to have different soil maps. The performance of those maps, together with WRB, WSR, Zobler, HWSD v2.0 and DSOLMAPS, was evaluated to improve the accuracy and reliability of the SWAT hydrological model. To achieve this, we conduct a comprehensive investigation involving multi-objective calibration, utilizing both flow data and soil moisture data to calibrate the model. Finally we incorporate a &amp;#160;pedotransfer function to include the landcover effect on Saturated Hydraulic Conductivity to improve the reliability of soil hydrological processes in the SWAT model.The study area, situated within the Cauquenes River Catchment, presents a complex hydrological system characterized by substantial spatial heterogeneity in soil properties. The soil mapping techniques under evaluation encompass traditional soil survey data integrated with remotely sensed soil information and machine learning-based soil mapping methodologies. These methods are compared in their ability to enhance the SWAT model's representation of the catchment's hydrological dynamics.In the case of the kmeans clustering approach the results of soil clusters are equivalent to soil units. A number of clusters from 3 to 100 were evaluated with the lowest DB index. Clusters from 3 to 16 presented an optimal range. The SWAT model calibration was performed under multi-objective evaluation, with kmeans soil cluster and DSoilMaps with better result for daily simulations.The work to correct the application of soil data, including in situ observation, satellite data and machine learning approach, provides a valuable approach to improve the calibration and validation processes of hydrological models in semi-arid regions, important for cacthment management and decision making processes, and to correctly assess the impacts of land use changes, climate variability and extreme events on water resources.&amp;#160;","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu24-12291,"",,

Potential evapotranspiration (PET) characterizes the atmosphere's capacity to remove water through evapotranspiration (ET). Evaporation and transpiration processes collectively transfer water from the Earth's surface to the atmosphere with rates determined by solar radiation, air temperature, relative humidity (specifically, vapor pressure deficit), wind speed, as well as the distinctive traits of vegetation, or crops and the practices employed in their cultivation. Estimates of reference evapotranspiraton (ET0) have been widely used across diverse scientific fields and practical domains, with PET measurements and related indices playing a crucial role in agricultural and natural resource management with demonstrated utility on scales from individual farms to regional and global. The aridity index (AI), which describes the ratio of precipitation to PET provides an integrated measure to gauge moisture availability for plant growth, generally of specific reference crops or specific vegetation types, enabling both spatial and temporal comparisons. In an era of rapid environmental and climatic transformations, these metrics, along with their derived indices, assume a pivotal role as direct and critical measures, as well as predictive tools, for gauging the trajectory, direction, and extent of climatic variations and their ramifications for terrestrial, and particularly agricultural, ecosystems. This latest addition to the Global_AI_PET database also includes three averaged multi-model ensembles produced for each of the four emission scenarios: All Models:&amp;#160;&amp;#160;includes all of the 25 ESM available; High Risk: includes 5 ESM which were identified as projecting the highest increases in temperature and significantly higher than the majority of estimates; Majority Consensus:&amp;#160;&amp;#160;includes 20 ESM, that is, all of the available ESM minus the five ESM in the &amp;#8220;High Risk&amp;#8221; category.&amp;#160;&amp;#160;Preliminary results based on CIMP6 ESM projections are provided showing significant change in global and regional trends for PET and aridity in the near- and medium-term, with implications for agriculture, biodiversity, watershed management, and water resources.

The Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment (GRACE) and GRACE-FollowOn (GRACE(-FO)) satellites have contributed significantly to our knowledge of variations in Earth&amp;#8217;s Total Water Storage (TWS) throughout the last twenty years. Nevertheless, the ability to detect hydrological activities is hindered by restrictions in spatial and/or temporal resolutions. This study introduces a sophisticated Deep Learning (DL) paradigm that is specifically developed for the spatial downscaling of GRACE TWS anomalies (TWSA). The technique employs soft constrained knowledge by developing a novel loss function to obtain higher spatial resolutions while preserving the integrity of the GRACE TWSA signal. The time series of Mass Conservation (Mascon) TWSA from Jet Propulsion Laboratories (JPLM) are downscaled in spatial resolution from 300 km to 50 km using spatiotemporal correlations of TWSA derived from the WaterGAP Hydrology Model (WGHM). The TWSA simulations consist of monthly time series spanning from April 2002 to December 2022. These downscaled TWSA time series were evaluated not only internally using statistical metrics but also externally comparing with the non-GRACE dataset that are related to the glacier mass loss signals, the interannual TWSA signal variations that are triggered by El Nin&amp;#771;o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), InSAR subsidence rates and the altimetry-derived water levels in major rivers. Furthermore, the DL methodology has been examined in both drought and flood events, where it was able to effectively bridge the gap between the GRACE and GRACE(-FO) satellite missions. These evaluations reveal the suggested DL strategy preserves the GRACE/-FO TWSA signal while also achieving an evolution to higher spatial resolution.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/gstm2024-54,"",,

However, nearly 60% of the global spatiotemporal variance in terrestrial PE remains unexplained<sup>3,5-7</sup>. Here, we integrate remote sensing and eco-evolutionary optimality theory to derive key plant traits, alongside explainable machine learning and global eddy covariance observations, to uncover the drivers of PE variations. Incorporating plant traits into our model increases the explained daily PE variance from 36% to 80% for C<sub>3</sub> vegetation and from 54% to 84% for C<sub>4</sub> vegetation compared to using climate data alone. Key plant traits—including chlorophyll content, leaf longevity, and leaf mass per area—consistently emerge as dominant factors across global biomes and temporal scales. Water availability and light conditions are also critical in regulating PE, underscoring the need for an integrative approach that combines plant traits with climatic factors.

While in-situ soil moisture and vegetation biomass measurements can provide detailed information, their representativeness is limited, and networks of sensors and field data are not widely available. Satellite observations offer global coverage, but retrievals can be infrequent or too coarse to capture the local extremes. This observation data gap often limits the use of remote sensing information for locally relevant processes understanding and policy implementation. To bridge this gap, recent advances in hyper-resolution land surface models (LSMs) &amp;#8211; operating at the ~100m to 1km resolution &amp;#8211; along with the ever-increasing availability of satellite and big environmental datasets, machine learning, and high-performance computing, provide a pathway forward to bridge data scales. This study highlights recent advancements in plant-soil-water dynamics in LSMs through improved realism in hyper-resolution land surface models and satellite land data assimilation. Previous research enabled soil moisture information at unprecedented scales across continental domains, exemplified by SMAP-HydroBlocks &amp;#8211; the first 30m resolution satellite-based surface soil moisture dataset in the United States. To refine the representation of plant-soil-water dynamics at hyper-resolution scales, we introduce the assimilation of monthly 250m resolution vegetation carbon biomass estimated from satellite observations, such as canopy height (GEDI) and leaf area index (MODIS), into the vegetation dynamics of the NOAA GFDL Earth System Model. We assess how vegetation biomass assimilation impacts root zone soil moisture, runoff, vegetation biomass, surface temperature, and evapotranspiration. By improving the spatiotemporal accuracy of plant-soil-water process estimates at the local scales, we can quantify and map their spatiotemporal variability and scaling behavior, which is critical to identifying freshwater-dependent ecological hotspots. Such advancements contribute to improved capabilities to detect droughts, their impacts on crop yields and ecosystems, and understand their interactions with climate at spatial scales required for many water and food security applications (~100s meters). In a rapidly evolving climate, bridging such data gaps and harnessing the ever-increasing potentials of satellite observation and Earth system models will continue to play a critical role. Integrating these technologies and methodologies offers a robust framework for responding to contemporary challenges in plant-soil-water processes and vegetation and surface water monitoring.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu24-13709,"",,

Water demand prediction is affected by variables, such as climate, socio-economic, and demographic data. This paper investigates urban monthly average water demand prediction, using classical, ensemble, and gradient boosting-based machine learning models, using the available monthly water demand, climatic, economic, and demographic data. Three train-test data split schemes on water demand timeseries were considered to determine the effect of data size on water demand prediction. Sensitivity analysis was employed to reduce input feature dimensionality while maintaining model accuracy. A univariate timeseries (water demand only) produced R2 scores up to 0.91, which increased to 0.94 with the addition of calendar and climatic features. Increasing the training data size from 70% to 90% improved the RMSE and MAE scores by ensemble and gradient boosting methods, with the random forest and the AdaBoost models showing improvements of up to 69%. The sensitivity analysis revealed a successful input reduction scheme from a potential 17 input attributes to seven inputs. Gradient boosting models showed robust and faster execution time, especially with the increase in training data, which is attractive for medium-term urban water demand forecasting.","",https://doi.org/10.55066/proc-icec.2021.14,"",,

Silvicultural operations (harvesting, thinning, bedding, and minor drainage and intensity) affect WT dynamics. Both WT dynamics and WH are also affected by tree stand age/growth and soil types, besides the climate. Knowledge gaps and future research using modeling, including machine learning methods are discussed. Abstract. Sustainable management of forested wetlands requires an understanding of water table (WT) dynamics affected by rainfall and evapotranspiration (ET) as well as management practices to sustain water quality, quantity, and ecosystem services. The hydrology, the most important factor influencing productivity of forested wetlands, may be characterized by measuring changes in WT depth over time. The hydrology of U.S. Southeastern Coastal Plain forested wetlands, particularly wet pine flats and pocosins, where drainage has been commonly used to improve tree growth, is relatively well understood. However, uncertainties remain regarding the effects of some silvicultural practices on WT dynamics of varying soil and drainage types and the role of climatic trends, including extreme events (precipitation and droughts), on WT dynamics of these forested lands. In this paper, we use information from long-term monitoring and modeling studies conducted at sites in the Southeastern Atlantic Coastal Plain to review the current state of research on potential effects of harvesting, thinning, bedding, and minor drainage on changes to WT dynamics in coastal non-riverine forested wetlands. We also briefly illustrate current gaps in knowledge and outline future potential research in this area.

The Biosphere reserves suffer drastic environmental degradation, natural calamities, and anthropogenic activities, preventing ecological growth, shrinking, and exploiting the land due to extreme climatic conditions. In this study, the Achanakmar-Amarkantak Biosphere Reserve (AABR) area has been selected and represents a biodiversity-rich ecosystem in central India. It is a lush forest; however, it has seen large-scale devastation in the context of climate change, as evidenced by increasingly unpredictable rainfall and higher temperatures between 2002 and 2022. In this scenario, there is a need for the essential application of remote sensing and machine learning techniques to monitor environmental degradation and its ecosystem in AABR. This study explores the nature of environmental degradation and its ecosystem in the study area. Using machine learning and Google Earth Engine, image classification techniques can reliably classify and map forest cover, land uses, and their spatial distributions. It will provide the long-term monitoring system by following six major spectral indices such as Land use and land cover, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, Normalized Difference Water Index, Leaf Area Index, Normalized Difference Built-up Index, Soil Adjustment Vegetation Index, and Land Surface Temperature were determined based on the annual average between 2002 to 2022. As observed in the LST, proportionate to built-up land increases rapidly, and water bodies and vegetation cover decrease during 2002-2022. Globally, this study presents a robust methodology that can be applied to other sub-tropical regions. This study suggests appropriate conservation, management, and policies by identifying degradation and monitoring over time. Land use and climate variability changes necessitate implementing and protecting the AABR without sacrificing the natural environment.","",https://doi.org/10.36948/ijfmr.2024.v06i03.23993,"",,

However, it is considered one of the most vulnerable groundwater systems to climate change, due to consistent declines in precipitation and recharge, and regional climate models project further declines into the future. This study introduces a new framework underpinned by machine learning techniques to provide reliable estimates of precipitation‐based recharge over the whole Perth Basin (including the Gnangara system). By combining estimates of baseflow, groundwater evaporation, and extraction, groundwater recharge was estimated over the Perth (testing site) and Gnangara (calibration site) systems using downscaled Groundwater Storage Anomalies (GWSA) from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission. The random forest regression (RFR) model was used to downscale the spatial resolution of GRACE to 0.05° (approx. 5 km), providing estimable signals over the relatively small calibration site (∼2,200 km 2 ) in order to discern any meaningful signals from the original GRACE resolution. Our study reveals that downscaled signals from GRACE can be used to provide precipitation‐based recharge estimates for groundwater systems accurately. However, the growing impacts of climate change, which has led to sporadic precipitation patterns over Western Australia, can limit the efficiency of satellite remote sensing methods in estimating recharge, especially in deep and complex aquifers.","",https://doi.org/10.1029/2024wr037360,"",,

The monitoring of soil moisture gained widespread recognition in the early 2000s as an integral component of the hydrological and meteorological observation systems. This momentum was accelerated with the establishment of several soil moisture monitoring networks. The collection of data from different networks with a diversity of sensors and data formats, harmonization, quality control, archiving of in situ soil moisture data and ensuring the free accessibility of this data for end-users underline the motivation behind the foundation of the International Soil Moisture Network (ISMN) in 2009.All in situ data sourced from the different providers undergo two quality checks. First, a visual inspection of the data excluding near real-time data and second, a rule-based automatic quality control procedure before inclusion in the ISMN database to ensure high quality research-ready soil moisture data for end-user. Thirteen different plausibility checks are applied to every singular hourly observation, which is flagged then as dubious if one of these checks fail, otherwise as &amp;#8220;good&amp;#8221;. These plausibility checks can be categorized into: i) a geophysical range verification, detecting the exceedance of certain thresholds (e.g., soil moisture values below 0 Vol.-%), ii) geophysical consistency methods, taking either ancillary in situ data if available or NASA&amp;#8217;s GLDAS Noah data into account. An example is the flagging of soil moisture where soil temperature is negative). And iii) spectrum-based approaches, using the first and second derivatives of the entire soil moisture timeseries to detect dubious soil moisture patterns (i.e., spikes, breaks, and plateaus).Publications in recent years point to the great potential of Deep Learning (DL) based methods for identifying anomalies in time series data. In this study, the potential of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Transformer models for anomaly detection in soil moisture time series is being investigated. Therefore, randomly selected time series from the ISMN are manually (visually) quality flagged (labelled). In order to be able to label these data we developed a guidance how to visually quality control in situ soil moisture data. Different Deep Learning methods in combination with varying external data sets (e.g. precipitation time series) are validated against the manually labelled data and compared to the previously implemented flagging method. The method will be further developed and evaluated for its use in ISMN operations. The incorporation of additional flagging information, especially when enhanced by Deep Learning methods, is anticipated to lead to a better usability of soil moisture data, as well as promoting a more robust quality control by the ISMN for its users in the future.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu24-16013,"",,

To make reliable statements about possible changes in groundwater level dynamics prediction models are needed. In this study, fuzzy rule-based models are used to analyse and quantify the effects of changing climate conditions on groundwater levels. Focussing on 114 groundwater wells in Lower Saxony, Germany, the study aims to explain groundwater dynamics using assumed relationships between climatic indices and groundwater levels. Starting from linear methods, we used fuzzy logic to capture the non-linearities in groundwater level systems. While fuzzy logic models have mostly been considered in combination with neural networks in groundwater level prediction, our approach utilises the transparency of fuzzy rule-based modelling to maintain model interpretability. To improve the forecast accuracy, we introduced moving averages and time lags to account for the persistent influence of meteorological indices. As reference we calculated multiple linear regression models. The performance of both fuzzy rule-based models and linear regression models are evaluated using split validation. To predict future changes in groundwater levels, we applied both models to climate model data based on the RCP8.5 scenario. It is expected that the non-linear fuzzy rule-based models outperform the linear regression models.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu24-9393,"",,

For this purpose, breads obtained from bran-enriched flours (% bran:wheat ratios: 10:90, 20:80, 30:70) of different red or white wheats were characterized for their polyphenol content, antioxidant activity (ABTS and DPPH methods), dietary fiber content, and physical (volume and weight, symmetry and crumb pore structure, crust and crumb color) and sensory properties for two succeeding harvesting years. The increase of bran content of flours up to 30% caused significant increases in total dietary fiber (3-fold), and phenolic content (1.6-fold) and antioxidant activity (2-fold) of breads. The antioxidant parameters and dietary fiber content of bread improved when flour and bran of red wheat genotypes were used instead of those of white wheat genotypes. The bran-enrichment reduced the physical quality parameters such as specific volume, pore structure and symmetry of obtained breads, but sensory properties (color, taste, odor, appearance, overall quality) of breads were acceptable even at 30% bran content. Combination of selected high-fiber and -polyphenol brans with strong flour wheat cultivars gives highly functional bread with acceptable quality.

rayyan-224207986,Hybrid Modeling of Evapotranspiration: Inferring Stomatal and Aerodynamic Resistances Using Combined Physics-Based and Machine Learning,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"The process of evapotranspiration transfers water vapour from vegetation and soil surfaces to the atmosphere, the so-called latent heat flux (𝑄 LE), and thus crucially modulates Earth’s energy, water, and carbon cycles. Vegetation controls 𝑄 LE through regulating the leaf stomata (i.e., surface resistance 𝑟 s) and through altering surface roughness (aerodynamic resistance 𝑟 a). Estimating 𝑟 s and 𝑟 a across different vegetation types proves to be a key challenge in predicting 𝑄 LE. Here, we propose a hybrid modeling approach (i.e., combining mechanistic modeling and machine learning) for 𝑄 LE where neural networks independently learn the resistances from observations as intermediate variables. In our hybrid modeling setup, we make use of the Penman-Monteith equation based on the Big Leaf theory in conjunction with multi-year flux measurements across different forest and grassland sites from the FLUXNET database. We follow two conceptually different strategies to constrain the hybrid model to control for equifinality arising when estimating the two resistances simultaneously. One strategy is to impose an a priori constraint on 𝑟 a based on our mechanistic understanding (theory-driven strategy), while the other strategy makes use of more observational data and adds a constraint in predicting 𝑟 a through multi-task learning of the latent as well as the sensible heat flux (𝑄 H ; data-driven strategy). Our results show that all hybrid models exhibit a fairly high predictive skill for the target variables with 𝑅 2 = 0.82-0.89 for grasslands and 𝑅 2 = 0.70-0.80 for forests sites at the mean diurnal scale. The predictions of 𝑟 s and 𝑟 a show physical consistency across the two regularized hybrid models, but are physically implausible in the under-constrained hybrid model. The hybrid models are robust in reproducing consistent results for energy fluxes and resistances across different scales (diurnal, seasonal, interannual), reflecting their ability to learn the physical dependence of the target variables on the meteorological inputs. As a next step, we propose to test these heavily observation-informed parameterizations derived through hybrid modeling as a substitute for overly simple ad hoc formulations in Earth system models.","",https://doi.org/10.1002/essoar.10512258.2,"",,

Conducting an integrated analysis of catchments based on similarity groups allows us to extract conclusions and observations about the overall controls of hydrological behavior, but also considering the specific and distinctive characteristics of each of these groups. This approach enables us to identify and comprehend the primary features influencing hydrological behavior within each distinct group, increasing hydrologic predictability and knowledge of catchments&amp;#8217; functioning, which is essential to better understand the impacts of climate change. In this study, we investigate the possible shifts in Brazilian catchment hydrology behavior in response to a changing climate. Employing a regional approach of the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to understand and predict streamflow across 735 catchments of six hydrologically similar groups in Brazil, we simulated streamflow throughout the 21st century. This simulation utilized a multi-model ensemble comprising 19 bias-corrected Global Climate Models (GCMs) from the sixth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6), driven by intermediate and high-emission scenarios (SSP245 and SSP585). Our results show that the regional LSTM outperforms the conventional hydrological modeling (NSE&amp;#8776;0.60), underscoring the reliability of deep learning to estimate streamflow with simplified input. Interestingly, we found that substantial variations in projected temperatures across scenarios do not necessarily correspond to significant differences in projected streamflow. Moreover, changes in precipitation and temperature may not exert proportional impacts on streamflow. Further, we will investigate the dynamics of transitions between catchment groups. This innovative approach to assess the impacts of climate change enhances the reliability of projected streamflow trajectories, a critical consideration given the uncertainties associated with CMIP6 models. Furthermore, this study holds potential utility in developing strategies to mitigate the impacts of climate change on Brazilian water resources.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu24-13880,"",,
rayyan-224208065,Advancing water quality assessment under uncertainties: Multi-risk and multi-scenario analyses in the face of future climate change,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Water quality is a critical element of ecosystem health and human well-being. However, it is increasingly challenged by a variety of human induced impacts related to land-use, socio-economic development, and climate change that alter the physical, chemical, and biological components. It is challenging to obtain a comprehensive understanding and effective management of water quality, especially under large uncertainties arising from future climate change and socio-economic developments. An integrated approach is essential for developing adaptive strategies that consider future uncertainties, ensuring the preservation of water quality and the sustainability of aquatic ecosystems in the face of evolving environmental conditions. This research investigates the intricate dynamics of water quality in transitional environments with a case study in the Venice Lagoon, particularly focusing on the uncertainties arising from future climate change. Utilizing a multi-scenario analysis approach, we explore a range of potential outcomes to understand the complex interactions shaping water quality in these critical ecosystems. The scenarios are designed to simulate future conditions, considering two different climate change scenarios (RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5), river load (reduced/unvaried river runoff), and the operation of the marine hydraulic interventions for flood prevention (the MOSE system) under medium- and long-term futures. Using data from SHYFEM-BFM - a 3D coupled hydrodynamic and ecological model, key physico-chemical parameters are integrated into a multi-parameter water quality index &amp;#8211; the CCMEWQI. This index considers the Scope (number of failed parameters), Frequency, and Amplitude of non-compliant tests to water quality standards for ecological status and aquatic life. By exploring diverse trajectories, we aim to anticipate potential shifts in water quality spatio-temporal dynamics. The multi-scenario analysis unfolds potential future states of water quality in the Venice Lagoon, highlighting critical points of vulnerability and resilience.The outcomes contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the complexities inherent in transitional water systems, aiding policymakers and water resource managers in making informed decisions to ensure the resilience and sustainability of water quality in the face of an uncertain future. Additionally, future developments extend the scope of this study to encompass a multi-risk assessment on river networks in the Veneto Regione to understand the multi-risk dynamic for regional water quality management. The multi-risk analysis in the freshwater system incorporates a range of stressors to river water quality, including single/compound extreme climate events and anthropogenic activities. We aim to unravel the multi-risk dynamics through the application of a novel approach employing machine learning techniques that encompass multiple hazards, exposures, and vulnerabilities. Furthermore, future scenarios of climate, land-use, and population changes are integrated into the multi-risk model together with nature-based solutions to create multi-risk scenarios for water quality, providing a holistic view of the potential risks and vulnerabilities in different environmental contexts.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu24-9472,"",,
rayyan-224208128,Hybrid-Modeling of Land-Atmosphere Fluxes Using Integrated Machine Learning in the ICON-ESM Modeling Framework,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"The exchange of water and carbon between the land-surface and the atmosphere is regulated by meteorological conditions as well as plant physiological processes. Accurate modeling of the coupled system is not only crucial for understanding local feedback loops but also for global-scale carbon and water cycle interactions. Traditional mechanistic modeling approaches, e.g., the Earth system model ICON-ESM with the land component JSBACH4, have long been used to study the land-atmosphere coupling. However, these models are hampered by relatively rigid functional representations of terrestrial biospheric processes, e.g., semi-empirical parametrizations for stomatal conductance.Here, we develop data-driven, flexible parametrizations controlling terrestrial carbon-water coupling based on eddy-covariance flux measurements using machine learning (ML). Specifically, we introduce a hybrid modeling approach (integration of data-driven and mechanistic modeling), that aims to replace specific empirical parametrizations of the coupled photosynthesis (GPP ) and transpiration (Etr ) modules with ML models pre-trained on observations. First, as a proof-of-concept, we train parametrizations based on original JSBACH4 output to showcase that our approach succeeds in reconstructing the original parametrizations, namely latent dynamic features for stomatal (gs) and aerodynamic (ga) conductance, the carboxylation rate of RuBisCO (Vcmax), and the photosynthetic electron transport rate for RuBisCO regeneration (Jmax). Second, we replace JSBACH4&amp;#8217;s original parametrizations by dynamically calling the emulator parameterizations trained on the original JSBACH4 output using a Python-FORTRAN bridge. This allows us to assess the impact of data-driven parametrizations on the output in the coupled land-surface model. In the last step, we adopt the approach to infer these parametrizations from FLUXNET observations to construct an observation-informed model of water and carbon fluxes in JSBACH4.Preliminary results in emulating JSBACH4 parametrizations reveal R2 ranging between 0.91-0.99 and 0.92-0.97 for GPP, Etr, and the sensible heat flux QH&amp;#160; at half-hourly scale for forest and grassland sites, respectively. JSBACH4 with the plugged-in ML-emulator parametrizations provides very similar, but not identical predictions as the original JSBACH4. For example, R2 for Etr (gs) amounts to 0.91 (0.84) and 0.93 (0.86) at grassland and forest sites, respectively. These differences in the transpiration flux between original predictions and JSBACH4 with emulating parametrizations only result in minor changes in the system, e.g., the soil-water budget in the two models is almost the same (R2 of ~0.99). Based on these promising results of our proof-of-concept, we are now preparing the hybrid JSBACH4 model with parametrizations trained on FLUXNET observations.This modeling framework will then serve as the foundation for coupled land-atmosphere simulations using ICON-ESM, where key biospheric processes are represented by our hybrid observation-informed land-surface model.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu24-2819,"",,
rayyan-224208207,Mapping terrestrial evaporation regimes : a data-driven analysis of land-atmosphere interactions under climate change,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Terrestrial ecosystems are essential for human life, as they provide several key services, such as food and water security, sequestration of anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) and evaporative cooling. Healthy ecosystems perform photosynthesis, during which the plants’ stomata, tiny apertures on the leaf surface, are open to take up CO2 and evaporate water into the atmosphere, thereby providing a cooling effect. At the Earth’s surface, all the energy that is available from solar radiation that is not used to evaporate water, is used to heat near-surface air. Thereby, ecosystems play a key role in connecting the energy and the water balance.In Chapter 1, I introduce the energy and the water balance, which are linked through the evaporation of terrestrial water by ecosystems. How much of the available energy is used to evaporate water from the land surface, the evaporative fraction (EF), depends on water supply (soil moisture); When the soil is too dry for plants to extract water from the soil, plants close their stomata to prevent water loss. As the soil moistens, plants can access this water and increase their transpiration with further soil moisture increases until the maximum EF is reached. At this point, any additional soil moisture increases will no longer affect the EF, rendering the magnitude of the evaporation of water, the terrestrial evaporation (ET), solely dependent on available energy. The soil moisture and the corresponding terrestrial evaporation regime can dampen or amplify heat waves and other extreme events. Therefore, distinguishing energy versus water-limited conditions and accurately representing in Earth system models is essential.The aim of this thesis is to study the relevance of water versus energy limited conditions and associated regime transitions for weather, climate and related extremes under climate change. In this data-driven analysis, a multitude of data streams is used, amongst which satellite observations, in-situ observations, such as weather balloons, gridded machine-learning based data sets and heavily constrained and unconstrained model output from Earth system models. Using such a combination of data products provides a comprehensive perspective that allows to infer the role of limitations in individual data products by comparing results between them.In addition to research focusing solely on either energy or water, I introduce a novel index in Chapter 2 that considers the relevance of both water and energy availability for terrestrial evaporation. Using satellite observations over Europe, energy limitation is found in Northern Europe and water limitation in the Mediterranean, separated by a transitional zone across Central Europe. A soil moisture threshold, the critical soil moisture (CSM), which separates energy and water-limited conditions, is determined at the continental and the grid cell scale. This transition matters, as it separates water-limited conditions, where soil moisture can impact the near-surface temperature through evaporation, from energy-limited conditions, where atmospheric dynamics and related temperature and solar radiation impact the evaporation of water. The CSM is sensitive to local climate, soil and vegetation characteristics, but is robust when determined using proxies from other data products for energy availability and terrestrial evaporation.As land-atmosphere interactions work both ways, land surface conditions can also be inferred from an atmosphere perspective: In Chapter 3, atmospheric temperature and humidity measurements from weather balloons are translated into landscape-scale surface fluxes using a mixed-layer model. Juxtaposing these surface fluxes against satellite-observed surface soil moisture, the CSM is estimated, which is then used to separate water versus energy-limited conditions. Further, I find that afternoon atmospheric boundary layers (ABLs) are warmer, drier and deeper over water-limited as compared to energy-limited surfaces.In Chapter 4, future trends ecosystem water limitation trends are studied with model output from a suite of state-of-the-art Earth system models, which (i) can complement data lacking from observations (e.g. root-zone soil moisture) and (ii) allows to infer future climate conditions. Ecosystem Limitation Index (ELI) trends based on historical simulations and future projections reveal a widespread increase in ecosystem water limitation under climate change. Although globally this is driven mostly by increasing energy availability, several hot spot regions are identified where ecosystem water limitation increases particularly rapid owing to simultaneous decreases in water availability. This shift towards ecosystem water limitation occurs in space, as transitional zones shift northwards in Canada and northern Eurasia and northeastwards in the Amazon, and in time through widespread lengthening of the water-limited season. Although net surface radiation is the most dominant driver for ELI trends, a full range of eco-climate variables is needed to understand local differences.In previous chapters, I mainly focused on mean climate conditions, whereas the role of land- atmosphere interactions for climate extremes is even more pronounced: In Chapter 5, I find that in about half of the land area with active vegetation, vegetation productivity extremes jointly occur with hydrometeorological hazards. The drivers of such vegetation extremes vary in space: In the Northern Hemisphere, temperature-related hazards are found important above 50°N, whereas water-related hazards most strongly impact vegetation productivity below 50°N. Further, several key regions are identified where vegetation productivity maxima are energy- driven and minima are governed by water, which is characteristic for transitional regimes and strong land-atmosphere coupling.In Chapter 6, an ensemble of Earth system models is used to find that in 77% of the vegetated land surface, maximum temperature is increasing more rapidly than mean temperatures under climate change. In several hot spot regions, such temperature divergence increases occur alongside shifts towards ecosystem water limitation and related reductions in evaporative cooling. Whereas the magnitude of temperature divergence trends is largest in initially energy-limited and transitional regions, where ELI trends are strongest, the sensitivity is highest in initially water- limited regions, where evaporative cooling is most strongly affected by increasing ecosystem water limitation.In Chapter 7, specific contributions, limitations and future research opportunities are synthesized. In conclusion, a novel index was introduced that jointly considers the relevance of energy and water availability for terrestrial evaporation. Typically, water-limited conditions are characterized by dry soils and correspondingly low terrestrial evaporation and high sensible heating of near- surface air. As such, ABLs are warmer and drier over water versus energy limitation, thereby amplifying heat extremes. Hot spot regions are found where heat extremes are amplified by reductions in evaporative cooling. Identifying such regions is essential to tailor adaptation strategies, such as irrigation or tillage practices, city greening and afforestation, to mitigate impact on human health and infrastructure. Further, these studies allow the comparison of modelled and observed land-atmosphere coupling, which could inform model development and lead to better weather and climate forecasts and accurate determination of land-atmosphere coupling hot spots and associated extreme events.","",https://doi.org/10.18174/569775,"",,
rayyan-224208246,Hydrological parameters modelling in catchments based on a geographical database.,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"The water systems management plays a pivotal role in environmental conservation and disaster mitigation. As climate change intensifies, the ecological interactions of our ecosystems are modified, decreasing biodiversity and increasing extreme events. Therefore, accurate hydrological modelling tools are crucial for predicting rainfall-runoff processes. Hydrological processes, in general, are complex due to the interaction between multiple variables and spatial and time scales. Therefore, the development of hydrological models has evolved from simple models with few parameters to complex models aiming to model all notable processes within the study area. However, some researchers affirm that increasing the number of free parameters does not necessarily improve the model performance, and retaining only necessary data can ensure that the model&amp;#8217;s components are positively represented. In this work, we show a set of geographical information system-based methodologies to set a limited optimal number of parameters to improve the hydrological modelisation. To achieve our purpose, we collected terrain information, land use and soil properties data to model the water balance based on historical precipitation and gauging data. The same model was replicated in 47 small watersheds north of the Iberian Peninsula to ensure reliability. The rainfall and water flow data were downloaded from the automatic hydrology information system of the Ebro Water Confederation (SAIHEbro). We obtained a 15-minute rainfall and water flow time series, and each of them started at different years, continuing to current times up to a length of 27 years (more than 35,000 records per year). As a result, we developed a database including the watershed limits, the most extended stream segment, rainfall and flow for each catchment. Furthermore, elevation, land use, soil classes, bulk density, clay, sand, and silt content (Hengl et al., 2017) at different depths were obtained. All data were transformed to a raster format to homogenise, and then their spatial resolution was harmonised to 2m for all spatial layers. The main shortcomings were found in matching the different spatial scales available in all the studied datasets. The lack of data or gaps in 2m DEM needed to be filled. Therefore, a nearest neighbour interpolation method combined with patching technique was performed by SAGA software and using 5m DEM as an input. Furthermore, differences in land use characterisation among regional and national datasets arose in some of the study catchments. By processing these datasets, we obtained essential parameters for hydrological modelling. Altogether, the gathered information was useful to simulate the evolution of the water-related processes, paying particular attention to the relationships between precipitation, soil water content and land use.

rayyan-224208259,"Cryosphere-fed rivers in a warming climate, 1950-205",,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Cryosphere-fed rivers drain glacier, snow, and permafrost landscapes and are characterized by glacial, nival, pluvial and mixed hydrological regimes. Such river systems originate from high-mountain areas and transport water, sediment, nutrients, and organic carbon downstream, underpinning the freshwater and coastal ecosystems and supporting the lives of more than one-third of the world&amp;#8217;s population.In response to the amplified climate change, accelerating glacier-snow melt and permafrost thaw, the cryosphere-fed rivers are overall becoming warmer, wider and muddier associated with markedly increasing river turbidity and suspended sediment concentration. For instance, observational data from 28 headwater rivers in High Mountain Asia reveal that the river suspended sediment loads have been increasing at a rate of ~13% per decade since the 1950s, much faster than rate of increase of river water discharge (~5% per decade). Leveraging over 120 in-field observations and a sediment-climate elasticity model, we estimate that the present-day river suspended sediment load in High Mountain Asia is nearly two billion metric tons per year, and could more than double by 2050 under an extreme climate change scenario. Beyond High Mountain Asia, such warming-driven increases in river turbidity and suspended sediment concentrations have also widely featured in other cryospheric basins such as the Arctic, European mountains, and Andes.The muddier rivers carry pollutants, nutrients, and organic carbon, thus affecting water quality and aquatic ecosystems in the cold regions and beyond. Increases in sediment-driven river turbidity can threaten river biotic conditions by blocking sunlight from reaching the streambed, limiting respiration, and deteriorating feeding conditions of benthic macroinvertebrates and fishes, thereby affecting habitat availability. Elevated turbidity can disturb habitats of macroinvertebrates and fishes by filling interstitial spaces between pebble and cobbles on the riverbed, thereby reducing the flow of oxygenated water through bed sediment that is essential to the survival of their eggs. The increased sediment supply especially the coarse sediment further magnifies river channel instability and migration, affecting fish habitats and carbon storage and release.To better assess the impacts of changing climate on the functions and services of river ecosystems in strategically important cold regions, we highlight the pressing need to integrate multiple-sourced river observations, to develop empirical, physics-based, and AI-based river flux models, and to promote interdisciplinary scientific collaboration. The innovative system approach would best come from the creation of an interdisciplinary collaborative initiative, where climatologists, ecologists, glaciologists, permafrost scientists, hydrologists, civil engineers, and geomorphologists work together to establish an integrated cryosphere&amp;#8211;water&amp;#8211;sediment&amp;#8211;carbon-ecology observation platform that facilitates the mechanism understanding and development of novel and powerful models. Furthermore, dialogues and collaboration between international scientists, stakeholders, local communities, and policymakers would help to bridge the gaps between state-of-the-art scientific findings and practicable adaptation strategies.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu24-3133,"",,
rayyan-224208268,The Future Change in Evaporation Based on the CMIP6 Merged Data Generated by Deep-Learning Method in China,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Land evaporation (LET) is an important variable in climate change, water cycle and water resources management. Mastering the projected changes in LET is significant for crop water requirements and the energy cycle. The global climate model (GCM) is a vital tool for future climate change research. However, the GCMs have low spatial resolution and relatively high errors. We use a deep learning (DL)-based model to deal with this problem. The DL approach can downscale the model data and merge simultaneously. We applied the DL approach to a suit of models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 6th edition (CMIP6) LET data. From the result of all the evaluation metrics, the DL merged data greatly improved in both spatial and time dimensions. The mean RMSE is 5.85 mm and the correlation is 0.95 between the DL merged data and reference data (historical reliable evaporation data). The future LET evidently increases in four scenarios (SSP1–2.6, SSP2–4.5, SSP3–7.0, and SSP5–8.5), and the upward intensity rises from the low to high emission scenarios. The highest increasing regions are in the Tibet Plateau and the south of China and the trend is larger than 10 mm/decade in the high scenarios. From the seasonal point of view, the increasing trend in spring and summer is far larger than for autumn and winter. The Tibet Plateau and the northeast of China have the largest upward trend in the spring of SSP5–8.5, higher than 1.6 mm/decade.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/w14182800,"",,
rayyan-224208279,On water and ice classification from Sentinel-2 imagery using machine learning,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Accurate and dynamic mapping of water and ice surfaces is directly useful to navigation and lake ice cover monitoring to study climate change. Water and ice maps are also useful for various scientific applications such as atmospheric correction of satellite imagery, remote sensing of water quality, and as input data for hydrological, weather and climate models. The existing literature shows that multi-spectral satellite imagery, as provided by Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8, provides a very effective means to discriminate between water, land, and ice. However, most studies focus either on very specific cases (a specific lake for instance), or on general cases but without complex and yet very frequent cases such as turbid waters and salt lakes which can be confused with snow and ice. The Copernicus High-Resolution Snow and Ice Monitoring Service provides an operational Sentinel-2 ice and water classification product at 20m resolution but with a lot of confusion on the aforementioned cases. Using a database of 31 fully hand-labelled Sentinel-2 L2A atmospherically corrected images, and machine learning SVM and RandomForest methods, the current study shows that the classification of land, water, ice, snow, turbid waters, salt lake categories can be achieved with an accuracy over 93%. It is also shown that the atmospheric correction has little to no impact on the results, as training and evaluating from L1C top of the atmosphere images instead of L2A images yields very similar results. This last find is very useful as it means that very accurate surface masks can now be provided to atmospheric processors and may therefore considerably improve the quality of atmospherically corrected images when compared to the current usage of static masks.","",https://doi.org/10.1002/essoar.10512606.1,"",,
rayyan-224208391,Managed groundwater recharge at the farm scale in pre-Saharan Morocco,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The oases of the pre-Saharan basin of Wadi Ferkla in southeastern Morocco receives low and erratic rainfall (average of 141 mm/year and inter-annual standard deviation of 70 mm - Ait-Bouijane rain gauge over the period 1961-2018). From the 70's, surface and groundwater are increasingly used due to the expansion of irrigation, mainly along two wadis, namely Wadis Ferkla and Satt originating in the High-Atlas and the Anti-Atlas Mountains, respectively. Their flows reach the Ferkla&amp;amp;#8217;s irrigated perimeters only when the volume of the flood events exceed upstream evaporation, withdrawals and riverbed's infiltration.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Nowadays, these irrigated perimeters exert significant pressure on groundwater resources, through numerous drillings equipped with pumping systems, most of them are powered by solar energy. This unsustainable situation incentivizes individual farmers to design and implement innovative technics to increase water access for their farms. For instance, the spreading of floodwaters - an ancestral and collective irrigation practice in traditional oases - is currently being adopted and adapted by individuals at the farm level. The technique consists on partially diverting flood flows into earthen basins. The stored water either infiltrates to recharge local aquifers, or is pumped for flood irrigation of date palms.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;An experimental protocol was set up to characterize groundwater recharge below one of these on-farm basins equipped with a recharge well. Barometric probes were installed in the basin, in the recharge well and in neighboring boreholes to automatically monitor water table levels (10-minute-time-step). Manual measurements were performed regularly to calibrate the monitoring probes. A topographic survey of the monitoring points and of the basin aimed at deriving piezometric levels from water levels measurements and estimating the height-surface-volume curves of the basin. After 7 months of continuous monitoring, 3 flood events were recorded. The establishment of the basin water balance at a fine time-resolution allowed estimating its different components including the infiltration rate influencing groundwater recharge. An Analytical modeling of this process was developed to explore alternative design and management options of the basin. This approach aims to contribute to a broader reflection on securing water management in this fragile oasis ecosystem.&amp;lt;img src=&amp;quot;data:image/jpeg;base64,

rayyan-224208560,A Hybrid Framework for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting of Daily Urban Water Demand Using Attention-Based Convolutional Neural Network and Long Short-Term Memory Network,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Urban water demand forecasting is beneficial for reducing the waste of water resources and enhancing environmental protection in sustainable water management. However, it is a challenging task to accurately predict water demand affected by a range of factors with nonlinear and uncertainty temporal patterns. This paper proposes a new hybrid framework for urban daily water demand with multiple variables, called the attention-based CNN-LSTM model, which combines convolutional neural network (CNN), long short-term memory (LSTM), attention mechanism (AM), and encoder-decoder network. CNN layers are used to learn the representation and correlation between multivariate variables. LSTM layers are utilized as the building blocks of the encoder-decoder network to capture temporal characteristics from the input sequence, while AM is introduced to the encoder-decoder network to assign corresponding attention according to the importance of water demand multivariable time series at different times. The new hybrid framework considers correlation between multiple variables and neglects irrelevant data points, which helps to improve the prediction accuracy of multivariable time series. The proposed model is contrasted with the LSTM model, the CNN-LSTM model, and the attention-based LSTM to predict the daily water demand time series in Suzhou, China. The results show that the hybrid model achieves higher prediction performance with the smallest mean absolute error (MAE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and largest correlation coefficient (R2).","",https://doi.org/10.3390/su141711086,"",,

The use of artificial intelligence (AI) in tracking and predicting water quality parameters has surpassed the use of other conventional methods. This study presents the assessment of three main models: adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), artificial neural network (ANN) and multiple linear regression (MLR) on water quality parameters of Wangchu river located at capital city of Bhutan. The performance and predictive ability of these models are compared and the optimal model for predicting the parameters are recommended based on the coefficient correlation (CC), root mean square error (RMSE) and Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) evaluation criteria. Overall NSE and RMSE, the ANN model predicted parameters with maximum efficiency of 97.3 percent and minimum error of 8.57. The efficiency of MLR and ANFIS model are 95.9 percent and 94.1 percent respectively. The overall error generated by MLR and ANFIS are 10.64 and 12.693 respectively. From the analysis made, the ANN is recommended as the most suitable model in predicting the water quality parameters of Wangchu river. From the six-training function of ANN, trainBR (Bayesian Regularization) achieved the CC of 99.8%, NSE of 99.3% and RMSE of 9.822 for next year data prediction. For next location prediction, trainBR achieved CC of 99.2%, NSE of 98.4% and RMSE of 6.485, which is the higher correlation and maximum efficiency with less error compared to rest of the training functions. The study represents first attempt in assessing water quality using AI technology in Bhutan and the results showed a positive conclusion that the traditional means of experiments to check the quality of river water can be substituted with this reliable and realistic data driven water models. Article highlights Total dissolved solids (TDS), electrical conductivity (EC), potential of hydrogen (pH) and dissolved oxygen (DO) are selected as main water quality parameters as data for modeling. Artificial neural network model gives highest efficiency and accuracy compared to MLR and ANFIS model. Use of artificial intelligence shows better performance to provide water quality and future predictions over conventional methods leading to conservation of water resources and sustainability.","",https://doi.org/10.1007/s42452-022-05181-y,"",,
rayyan-224208575,Water Quality Analysis of Drinking Water Resource Lake Sapanca and Suggestions for the Solution of the Pollution Problem in the Context of Sustainable Environment Approach,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Lake Sapanca is the drinking water source of the Sakarya province of Turkey. Intensive urbanization in the region is the main obstacle to implementing appropriate physical planning and measures to adapt to rapid change. The monitoring of the water quality parameters in the planning and management of the lakes is significant. The Artificial Neural Network (ANN), a mathematical representation of the human brain’s functioning, was employed to estimate the Lake’s Dissolved Oxygen (DO) concentration. pH, Magnesium (Mg), Temperature (Temp), Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), Orthophosphate (o-PO4), Nitrite Nitrogen (NO2-N), and Nitrate Nitrogen (NO3-N) were used as independent parameters. The successful ANN model gives better results compared to the traditional multiple linear regression (MLR) analysis. The developed model can be used for forecast purposes to complete the missing data in the future and support the decision process for pollution reduction through sustainable environmental management. The eutrophication threat for Lake Sapanca has been revealed. The main objective is to create the scientific infrastructure that will draw attention to the rapid urbanization problem with ANN and eutrophication models’ outputs. It has been understood that the protection of the water budget of Lake Sapanca is the primary solution method in terms of ecological sustainability to eliminate the existing pollution.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/su13073917,"",,
rayyan-224208620,Deep Learning-Based Forecasting of Groundwater Level Trends in India: Implications for Crop Production and Drinking Water Supply,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Despite numerous studies in recent times, there is no consensus on the primary drivers for groundwater storage (GWS) changes over India. Thus, predicting future groundwater level trends seems remote. In this context, using Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE)-derived GWS, WaterGap model-based groundwater recharge (GWR), and groundwater withdrawal (GWW), we show that GWW exhibits a stronger dominance than GWR on GWS change over India. Furthermore, we developed feed-forward neural network (FNN), recurrent neural network (RNN), and deep learning-based long short-term memory network (LSTM) models using multidepth in situ observations from a dense network of monitoring wells (n = 5367, 1996–2018), to simulate and forecast groundwater levels (GWL) in India. The result demonstrates the better performance of LSTM (>84% of observation wells showing r > 0.6, RMSEn < 0.7) across India, outperforming both FNN and RNN in the testing period of 5 years (2014–2018). Our estimates also reveal that besides the prevailing long-term (1996–2018) statistically significant (p < 0.1) declining GWL trends in northwest India and the Ganges river basin, higher declining trends will potentially be observed in parts of north-central and south India in the forecasting period of 5 years (2019–2023). We envisage that the forecasting approach presented in the study can contribute toward an improved urban–rural drinking water supply and sustainable crop production for 1.3 billion people in India.","",https://doi.org/10.1021/acsestengg.0c00238,"",,
rayyan-224208660,Towards a cyber-physical system for sustainable and smart building: a use case for optimising water consumption on a SmartCampus,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract In recent years, the joint advance of the Internet of Things and Artificial Intelligence is enabling challenging developments for Smart Cities and Communities (S&amp;CC). In particular, the SmartCampus, as an essential part of S&amp;CC, acquires a transverse protagonism. On the one hand, SmartCampuses are a realistic representation of more complex systems (i.e., intelligent cities or territories) where to deploy sensors and plan specific goals. Nevertheless, on the other hand, Smartcampuses allow the coexistence of different technologies and networks of experts that facilitate the development, testing, and evolution of technologies. This paper describes the Cyber-Physical System SmartPoliTech, an Internet of Things Framework, as part of a future smart campus. SmartPoliTech develops an innovative framework that facilitates communication between different systems, data visualization, consumption modeling, alert generation, and the awareness of sustainability and environmental issues. This framework is based on a Service-Oriented Architecture to control all processes, from hardware to decision-making systems. This paper provides a sustainable and intelligent water management system to predict water consumption using Gaussian Mixture Models as day-, month- and even hour-dependent functions based on this Cyber-Physical System. The proposed solution can be used in any facility, with significant benefits being foreseen in metrics such as the minimization of water wastage.","",https://doi.org/10.1007/s12652-021-03656-1,"",,
rayyan-224208672,Multi-Step Ahead Probabilistic Forecasting of Daily Streamflow Using Bayesian Deep Learning: A Multiple Case Study,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"In recent decades, natural calamities such as drought and flood have caused widespread economic and social damage. Climate change and rapid urbanization contribute to the occurrence of natural disasters. In addition, their destructive impact has been altered, posing significant challenges to the efficiency, equity, and sustainability of water resources allocation and management. Uncertainty estimation in hydrology is essential for water resources management. By quantifying the associated uncertainty of reliable hydrological forecasting, an efficient water resources management plan is obtained. Moreover, reliable forecasting provides significant future information to assist risk assessment. Currently, the majority of hydrological forecasts utilize deterministic approaches. Nevertheless, deterministic forecasting models cannot account for the intrinsic uncertainty of forecasted values. Using the Bayesian deep learning approach, this study developed a probabilistic forecasting model that covers the pertinent subproblem of univariate time series models for multi-step ahead daily streamflow forecasting to quantify epistemic and aleatory uncertainty. The new model implements Bayesian sampling in the Long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network by using variational inference to approximate the posterior distribution. The proposed method is verified with three case studies in the USA and three forecasting horizons. LSTM as a point forecasting neural network model and three probabilistic forecasting models, such as LSTM-BNN, BNN, and LSTM with Monte Carlo (MC) dropout (LSTM-MC), were applied for comparison with the proposed model. The results show that the proposed Bayesian long short-term memory (BLSTM) outperforms the other models in terms of forecasting reliability, sharpness, and overall performance. The results reveal that all probabilistic forecasting models outperformed the deterministic model with a lower RMSE value. Furthermore, the uncertainty estimation results show that BLSTM can handle data with higher variation and peak, particularly for long-term multi-step ahead streamflow forecasting, compared to other models.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/w14223672,"",,
rayyan-224208982,Short-term forecasting of monthly water consumption in hyper-arid climate using recurrent neural networks,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Freshwater supply is a major challenge in regions with limited water resources and extremely arid climatic conditions. The objective of this study is to model the monthly water demand in Kuwait using the nonlinear autoregressive with exogenous input (NARX) neural network approach. The country lacks conventional surface water resources and is characterized by extremely arid climate. In addition, it has one of the fastest growing populations. In this study, linear detrending is performed on the water consumption time series for the period from January 1993 to December 2018 to eliminate the influence of population growth before application to the NARX model. Monthly temperature data are selected as exogenous input to the NARX model, because they are strongly associated with the water consumption data. Correlation analyses are performed to determine the input and feedback delays of the NARX model. The results demonstrate that the recurrent NARX model is efficient and robust for forecasting the short-term water demand, with a Nash-Sutcliffe (NS) coefficient of 0.837 in the validation period. Seasonal model assessment shows that the model performs best during the critical summer season. The NARX-based recurrent model is established as a powerful and promising tool for predicting urban water demand. Thus, it can efficiently aid the development of resilient water supply plans.","",https://doi.org/10.36909/jer.v9i3b.10893,"",,
rayyan-224208987,"Water Systems Analysis, Design, and Planning",,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"This book presents three distinct pillars for analysis, design, and planning: urban water cycle and variability as the state of water being; landscape architecture as the medium for built-by-design; and total systems as the planning approach. The increasing demand for water and urban and industrial expansions have caused myriad environmental, social, economic, and political predicaments. More frequent and severe floods and droughts have changed the resiliency and ability of water infrastructure systems to operate and provide services to the public. These concerns and issues have also changed the way we plan and manage our water resources. Focusing on urban challenges and contexts, the book provides foundational information regarding water science and engineering while also examining topics relating to urban stormwater, water supply, and wastewater infrastructures. It also addresses critical emerging issues such as simulation and economic modeling, flood resiliency, environmental visualization, satellite data applications, and digital data model (DEM) advancements. Features: Explores various theoretical, practical, and real-world applications of system analysis, design, and planning of urban water infrastructures Discusses hydrology, hydraulics, and basic laws of water flow movement through natural and constructed environments Describes a wide range of novel topics ranging from water assets, water economics, systems analysis, risk, reliability, and disaster management Examines the details of hydrologic and hydrodynamic modeling and simulation of conceptual and data-driven models Delineates flood resiliency, environmental visualization, pattern recognition, and machine learning attributes Explores a compilation of tools and emerging techniques that elevate the reader to a higher plateau in water and environmental systems management Water Systems Analysis, Design, and Planning: Urban Infrastructure serves as a useful resource for advanced undergraduate and graduate students taking courses in the areas of water resources and systems analysis, as well as practicing engineers and landscape professionals.","",https://doi.org/10.1201/9781003241744,"",,
rayyan-224209071,Agent-Based Modeling for Integrated Urban Water Management,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Comprehensive integrated urban water management (IUWM) framework opens the more holistic path for urban level management. Researchers came forward with water resource management framework considering quantity and quality of water resource, use pattern, wastewater generation, and its reuse, but this framework was limited to water supply and wastewater infrastructures i.e., the physical characteristics of urban water cycle. However, the inter-dependencies, complexities and uncertainties of the water environments made the problem unsolved due to unavailability of generic model or any single sufficient method to address the issues of urban water sub-basin. Therefore, urban water sustainability can be seen as a rigorous complex computational task for which artificial intelligence approaches may play a vital role to establish inter-relationship among various measures within the frameworks. Agent-based modelling may be a game changer in water development for existing and future water related activities in an urban setup. ABMs have potential to model water stakeholders and their interactions based on their authorities and behavioural rules with complexities of the system. As a result, an agent-based IUWM framework including UN-SDG-6, with complex behavioural rules and environmental uncertainties may be an efficient approach to achieve sustainable urban water management.","",https://doi.org/10.1201/9781003203445-15,"",,
rayyan-224209175,Assessing the potential of digitalization by real-time monitoring of bacterial concentration in urban water systems,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Digital solutions open up a variety of opportunities for the water sector. Digital water is now seen not as an &amp;amp;#8216;option&amp;amp;#8217; but as an &amp;amp;#8216;imperative&amp;amp;#8217; (Sarni et al., 2019) for a more sustainable and secure water management. Many solutions leverage the latest innovations developed across industries and business activities including advanced sensors, data analytics and artificial intelligence. The potential of digitalization might outweigh its associated risk if digital solutions are successfully implemented addressing a series of gaps and barriers such as ICT governance, cybersecurity, data protection, interoperability and capacity building.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Within this context, the H2020 innovation project digital-water.city (DWC) aims at boosting the integrated management of waters systems in five major European cities &amp;amp;#8211;&amp;amp;#160;Berlin, Copenhagen, Milan, Paris and Sofia&amp;amp;#160;&amp;amp;#8211; by leveraging the potential of data and digital technologies. Goal is to quantify the benefits of a panel of 15 innovative digital solutions and achieve their long-term uptake and successful integration in the existing digital systems and governance processes.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;One of these promising technology is a new sensor for real-time bacterial measurements, manufactured by the company Fluidion (ALERT System; Angelescu et al., 2019). The device is fully autonomous, remotely controllable, installed in-situ and allows rapid quantification of E.coli and enterococci&amp;amp;#160;concentrations.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Ensuring microbial safety is one of the key objectives of bathing water management, and it is also a critical aspect for water reuse. The European Bathing Water Directive (BWD) (76/160/EEC, 2006) uses fecal indicator bacteria for quality assessment of marine and inland waters. A major challenge regarding bathing water management is that concentrations of fecal bacteria may show spatial and temporal variability. In urban rivers, discharges from CSO and stormwater may contain high amounts of fecal bacteria and contaminate bathing water quality. Bathing water surveillance in Europe is only based on monthly grab samples and event-scale variability is detected only by chance as pollution events may occur between sampling intervals.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The ALERT System is currently tested in Berlin and Paris using side by side laboratory comparison to understand temporal variability and spatial bacterial distribution in the local rivers (Seine, Marne and Spree). In Milan, the system is being deployed to provide early warning of bacterial and toxic contamination linked to water reuse at a major wastewater treatment plant. Preliminary analysis have shown that the device shows metrological capabilities comparable to those of an approved laboratory using MPN microplate techniques and is suitable for bacterial pollutant concentration ranges such as urban streams and wastewater treatment plant.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The technology opens up new opportunities for the water sector for a range of applications such as the planning of pollution reduction measures, the continuous monitoring of bathing water quality and the assessment of contamination risk by the reuse of treated wastewater for irrigation. In particular, it is a key innovation to contribute to the objective of Paris city and other local municipalities to provide permanent and safe opportunities for bathing in the Seine river for the 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Games, and beyond.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu2020-19909,"",,
rayyan-224209189,Featured Collection Introduction: “Connecting Land and Water for Healthy Communities”,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"This featured collection is a part of growing public policy conversation, professional practice, and academic research focused on the need and strategies to integrate land use and water planning. The need arises from fragmentation in the ways that professionals think about and have been organized to deal with land and water in their workplaces and professional organizations. However, there is an increasing recognition that land and water planning must be done jointly because how we use land shapes our demand for water and greatly impacts water quality, while the way we use and manipulate water involves significant changes to land. Integrative land–water strategies are the focus of this featured collection. The collection's purpose is to contribute to fostering land and water connections across the physical, social, and ecological domains. Here we provide a brief background on the origins of this featured collection in a 2021 specialty conference organized and hosted by the American Water Resources Association (AWRA) and the Babbitt Center for Land and Water Policy (Babbitt Center), and done in collaboration with many other sponsors, supporters, and participating organizations. We cover other activities associated with the 2021 specialty conference and plans for continuing conversations at a 2023 follow-up conference. We also highlight some of the themes and insights from this featured collection. Finally, we invite continuing submissions on integrating land and water to the Journal of the American Water Resources Association (JAWRA), which is planning another featured collection on this important topic. This featured collection11 While the guest associate editors of this collection were involved in the conference and are co-authors of some of the publications included here, none of them handled their own submissions and standard blind peer review procedures were strictly followed. The papers also adhered to all other editorial and peer review requirements of the journal. emerged from the 2021 virtual summer specialty conference entitled “Connecting Land and Water for Healthy Communities” (AWRA and Babbitt Center 2021a). The conference was the result of a collaboration between Jim Holway of the Babbitt Center for Land and Water Policy (a center of the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy) and Sharon Megdal of the Water Resources Research Center at the University of Arizona and board member of AWRA. Jim and Sharon are long-time colleagues and friends as well as practitioners and scholars of land and water integration, especially as it pertains to the Colorado River Basin. They served as the conference committee co-chairs from the two partnering host organizations, AWRA and Babbitt Center, and involved leaders and representatives from other national organizations on the conference committee. Those organizations included the Alliance for Water Efficiency (AWE), American Planning Association (APA), American Water Works Association (AWWA), United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), United States Water Alliance, and Water Research Foundation (WRF). Even more organizations were involved on the host and program committees, including representatives from foundations, utilities, universities, private firms, and various state, tribal and federal agencies. Members of the conference, host and program committees comprised the larger conference planning committee (AWRA and Babbitt Center 2021b). The 2021 AWRA specialty conference built on several previous efforts. The APA hosted “Water and Planning Connect” in Kansas City from September 11 to 12, 2018, the first conference aimed at bringing together land use planning and water management professionals from the public and private sectors. The conference addressed the pressing issues at the intersection of land and water, including the effects of climate change, aging infrastructure, and water equity, and how to overcome fragmentation in responding to these large-scale challenges. “Water and Planning Connect” followed several years of activities within APA aimed at recognizing the importance of integrating water into land use planning. These activities included a 2016 update of the APA Policy Guide on Water (APA 2016), the 2017 formation of APA's Water and Planning Network (WPN) (APA 2017), and the 2017 publication of PAS WPN Report 588, “Planners and Water” (Cesanek et al. 2017). More recently, several experts directly involved in these efforts have authored additional publications on the potential impact comprehensive plans have to address land and water integration at a local level (Rouse and Piro 2021; Rugland 2021). APA is an organization largely consisting of land use planners, and its recognition of the importance of considering water in land use planning and corresponding practice-related activities has been a significant contribution. The reciprocal importance of considering the implications of land use planning for water management was brought to the fore in the 2021 “Connecting Land and Water for Healthy Communities” conference by Jim and Sharon along with the original inceptors, Chi Ho Sham of AWWA, William (Bill) Cesanek of APA, and Mary Ann Dickinson, past president of AWE. AWRA, an organization largely consisting of water resource professionals, reached out to land use planners in an effort to connect the professional realms of land and water just as APA did to its water constituents for “Water and Planning Connect” in 2018. The AWRA and Babbitt Center specialty conference was held virtually from July 19 to 21, 2021 and featured keynote speakers Tanya Trujillo, United States Department of the Interior Assistant Secretary for Water and Science, and Aziza Akhmouch, Head of the Urban Policies and Sustainable Development Division within the Centre for Entrepreneurship, SMEs, Regions and Cities of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). The conference also included a pre- and post-conference workshop, two panels, 24 technical sessions, crowdsourcing land and water dialogues, and networking opportunities (AWRA and Babbitt Center 2021c). The mix of activities was designed to bring together practitioners and researchers across the intersecting areas of water management, land use planning, natural resources policy, and related technical and design professions. The conference focused on fostering relationships among water resources management, utility operations, and land use planning and design to strengthen connections across disciplines, professions, and organizations. Topics included land and water aspects of water supply, water demand management, stormwater management, wastewater treatment, community planning and design, conservation, and integrated “one water” approaches. The key theme running throughout the conference was the recognition that connecting land and water is necessary for healthy and resilient communities and that new tools and evidence-based strategies are needed to foster and evaluate experiences with making those connections. This featured collection is just one of the several activities associated with the 2021 “Connecting Land and Water for Healthy Communities” conference. Here we highlight three of them. Preceding the July 2021 conference, AWRA published a special issue of Water Resources IMPACT (March/April 2021, Volume 23, Number 2) on “Connecting Land and Water for Healthy Communities” (AWRA 2021a). The issue was guest edited by Mike Antos, who wrote in “About this Issue” (p. 1): “Arguably, managing water separately from land was one of the great missteps of the 20th century. Turning our eyes to past practices, and recognizing the role watersheds play in the health of the environment and our communities, we see that land and water must be managed together as integrated social-natural systems … I am proud as guest editor to share these stories and examples of how land use managers and water managers are rediscovering the power of partnering for the benefit of people and the environment.” This special issue of Water Resources IMPACT included eight articles introducing important perspectives and work related to the conference theme. Case studies from all over the country focused on integrative land–water solutions, bringing attention to vulnerable communities in flood-prone areas and areas impacted by drought, and specific ways in which strategies for greater integration is key to addressing this vulnerability. This special issue of Water Resource IMPACT was a valuable introduction to topics and actions taking place on the ground in communities that were incorporated into the 2021 specialty conference. One major outcome of the 2021 Conference was the “Findings Statement and Call to Action from the Specialty Conference: Connecting Land & Water for Healthy Communities” which was approved by AWRA with the Babbitt Center for Land and Water Policy, the APA Water and Planning Network, and the AWWA. After the conference, members of the planning committee came together and agreed on the importance of actualizing integrative land and water solutions. Together, they drafted a “Findings Statement” of key conclusions they drew from the diversity of presentations and conversations throughout the conference. These findings acknowledge the major ways fragmentation occurs and how it results in unsustainable patterns of growth and resource utilization that increase vulnerabilities of communities to water and land-related risks. Realizing that a findings statement was not enough, they included a “Call to Action” to encourage their organizations, other conference participants, and the land and water professional community at large to implement the set of guiding principles included in the findings statement. This “Findings Statement and Call to Action” was approved as an official AWRA Policy Statement (AWRA 2021b) and is also reprinted here in this featured collection (AWRA et al. 2021). We are pleased that the productive conversations will continue, and the land and water community will have opportunities to discuss how it is implementing the Call to Action by bringing forth more examples and lessons. In July of 2023, AWRA will be hosting the second specialty conference on the general theme of “Connecting Land and Water for Healthy Communities,” scheduled for July 17 to 19, 2023 in Denver, Colorado (AWRA 2022). Our hope is that this collection of activities, research, and partnerships and yet another opportunity to meet, this time in person in Denver, Colorado, will indeed inspire additional collaborations, new ideas and inquiries, and creative and bold actions that continue leading to implementation of integrative land–water solutions. The 2021 “Connecting Land & Water for Healthy Communities” specialty conference suggests that to ensure healthy and resilient communities, connecting planning and management of land and water is necessary. Moreover, the “Findings Statement and Call to Action” from this conference urges connections between multiple stakeholders and stakeholder groups and utilization of science, tools, practices, and technologies that integrate land and water planning and use. The integration of land and water planning is the foundational thread of the articles in this featured collection. However, the articles also showcase the ways in which integrative land–water solutions can be focused or more expansive in response to diverse stakeholders and varying circumstances and depending on how and where integration can be applied and adapted. Cross-cutting themes emerged in each of these pieces, including issues of scale, context, complexity; the need for new research, new ways of knowing, new tools; working in interdisciplinary teams and spanning boundaries across professions and organizations; the need for local as well as regional land–water coordination; and the use of an institutional lens in recognition of ways society can work more collectively toward larger scale societal sustainability. Stoker et al. (2022) begin this collection with a review of regulatory and non-regulatory strategies for integrated land–water solutions. The authors synthesize existing literature and emphasize the need for new research to establish the evidentiary basis to support the implementation of these strategies, prioritize one strategy over another, and determine the contexts in which various strategies are likely to be most effective. The scales inherent in both regulatory and non-regulatory strategies are apparent in each of the manuscripts included in this featured collection. Turner et al. (2022) also describe differences in scale between local ordinances, which can better integrate water and land use, vs. federal level regulations like the Clean Water Act that focus only on water quality. Sampson et al. (2022) look at city policies and water demand by examining a range of neighborhood housing typologies (essentially different scales of housing density) and conducting scenario planning analyses across the Denver Water service area. Wang and Vivoni (2022) employ regional scenario modeling to investigate the implications of climate and land use and land cover for future irrigation water demand in different cities, irrigation districts, and counties in central Arizona as well as at the regional scale. Endter-Wada et al. (2022) illustrate the scales of governance and institutional influence including examples of policies, processes, and projects at federal, state, local, and utility scales. They focus on cooperation and partnership between and within these scales to mobilize sustainability transitions. Jacobs et al. (2022) focus on the need to integrate planning across scales since different environmental issues occur and are dealt with through institutions with authority and influence in varying geographies (e.g., state, watershed, irrigation district, municipal, and individual property). Highlighting the importance of scale, the manuscripts in this featured collection show that context is an important aspect of integrated land–water management. Turner et al. (2022) note that stormwater professionals stated that multiple factors were part of their stormwater infrastructure decision making, including watershed-scale issues and other added complexities like climate change and social norms (complexities also suggested by Jacobs et al. 2022). They also find regional differences in stormwater professionals' decision making related to water quality (eastern states) vs. water quantity (western states) and potentials for green infrastructure solutions to more effectively help them link land and water. Although Sampson et al. (2022) found that incremental increases in residential density is one way to improve urban water efficiency, policies that reduce outdoor irrigation may have more success at reducing outdoor water demand than policies purely focused on increasing residential densities. They conclude that variations that relate to building type and specific density configurations are important contextual complexities to consider in understanding and managing urban water demand and outdoor water efficiency. Wang and Vivoni (2022) suggest that local contextual differences such as future land use change trajectories combined with climate change predictions are very important elements to consider in irrigation water use projections. Endter-Wada et al. (2022) show how integrating land and water can occur in numerous ways and result in distinctive forms. In their four examples, the integration occurs through analysis, by design, from conceptual borrowing, and via facilitation and, despite general application to many communities, it is context that determines specific outcomes, adopted practices, and instituted policies. Jacobs et al. (2022) highlight that environmental challenges are highly context dependent, including being influenced by social norms, population/demographic changes, and physical and climatic differences. Jacobs et al.’s (2022) call to look at “the intersection of the climate-land use-energy-water systems collectively” (p. 2) is an important consideration in this featured collection looking at integrated water–land planning. The authors remind us that even looking at two issues in an integrated way ignores the true complexity of the issues at hand. Sampson et al. (2022) and Wang and Vivoni's (2022) manuscripts provide focused examinations of water and land use interactions, which are important pieces of the puzzle in terms of water conservation and use. Yet, each manuscript also provides important insights through recognition and analysis of additional components that add complexity. Sampson et al. (2022) simulate the effects of human activity (building types where households choose to live) and other behavioral and technological changes (gains in irrigation efficiency) in addition to increasing housing density on future water demand. Wang and Vivoni's (2022) inclusion of climate change effects as well as differing modes of future land change related to urban growth shows how differences in irrigation water use can become even more pronounced in the future. Their works and insights could be built upon to include even more complexity (e.g., equity in housing; interactions between housing, water and transportation; implications of agricultural land loss on food, fuel, and fiber). Endter-Wada et al.’s (2022) examples speak to the institutional changes needed to move resilient solutions forward. Although the authors looked specifically at integrated land–water solutions, Endter-Wada et al. (2022) show the importance of partnerships and stakeholder engagement to foster institutional transformation that could translate to increasingly complex issues. Recognition of the importance of complexities at the intersection of climate, land use, energy, and water systems (CLEWs) is critical for stretching our analysis and understanding of problems and challenging and enabling us to find appropriate solutions. But it does not negate the need to work at the intersection of land and water. The reason linking land and water remains important is because human interaction with the environment occurs through the processes of using land and water and, increasingly, through processes of large-scale land use change and water manipulation, all of which are driven by social processes. Land changes to the surface of the earth affect the water cycle, especially large-scale urbanization in arid regions and development in flood-prone riparian and coastal areas in humid regions. Similarly, changes to natural water sources and flows affect the land, most dramatically illustrated when water diversions result in desiccated lakes, dry streams, and loss of wetlands, or when water is diverted from basins of origin, often to the detriment of human and ecological communities located on tribal and rural lands. Human changes to land or water without regard to impacts resulting from their linkage are dramatically changing the earth's surface. These changes are resulting in cascading effects on socio-ecological systems and on larger physical and climatic earth system processes. Changes occurring at the interface of land and water policy, planning, and management remain foundational because numerous government agencies have well-established regulatory and management authority over land and/or water as well as deeply rooted professional and institutional cultures where changes are key to societal sustainability transitions. Finally, the authors of the manuscripts and the associate editors of this featured collection suggest the following topics to consider exploring and using in future research and practice. We should strive to create comprehensive open-source data and use exploratory processes and data-driven tools to examine complex issues so that we can learn from each other and provide better decision support, the value of which is illustrated in the articles by Sampson et al. (2022) and Wang and Vivoni (2022). The need to determine metrics to examine water outcome goals and to use these metrics to understand success over time across case studies and contexts was emphasized by Stoker et al. (2022) and suggested in various ways throughout this collection. Developing paths forward to allow for adaptive management in planning, policy, and rulemaking and for institutional transformations rely not only on good analytic and evaluative techniques, but on the ability to build and use interdisciplinary teams, partnerships, and champions of new ideas to work on complex issues, as reinforced in the articles by Turner et al. (2022) and Endter-Wada et al. (2022). Issues at the intersections of climate–land use–energy–water systems are critical, as the questions raised in table 1 by Jacobs et al. (2022) indicate, which highlights why creating frameworks for coordination and integration across scales is so important. As the “Findings Statement and Call to Action” reminds us, integrating equity, health, and safety should be at the heart of every inquiry and practice, and our professions need to commit to guiding principles that help us keep this focus at the forefront of our work. The focus on “Connecting Land and Water for Healthy Communities” in the March/April issue of Water Resource IMPACT, the 2021 specialty conference and resulting “Findings Statement and Call to Action,” and this featured collection of JAWRA all contribute to recognizing land–water disconnections and finding integrated solutions for overcoming them. Much work needs to be done to understand the many dimensions, meanings, and implications of integrating land and water, to promote practices and technologies for facilitating integration, and to evaluate, test, and document the short- and long-term outcomes from integration (Quay et al. 2022). We look forward to land use and water management professionals' joint contributions to this work and to expanding our collective learning and conversations at the second AWRA summer specialty conference on this topic from July 17 to 19, 2023 in Denver, Colorado. Data sharing is not applicable to this article as no new data were created or analyzed in this study.","",https://doi.org/10.1111/1752-1688.13042,"",,
rayyan-224209279,Changes in the water footprint of urban green spaces over time,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The concept of a sustainable green city based on Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)&amp;amp;#8211;Goal 11 - sustainable cities and communities &amp;amp;#8211; may not be narrowed down to solely intensifying urban green spaces. Sustainability could include urban water management to alleviate possible conflict among &amp;amp;#8220;water&amp;amp;#8208;saving&amp;amp;#8221; and &amp;amp;#8220;greening cities&amp;amp;#8221; strategies. Water consumption by urban greenery has a major role in urban water management, particularly in water-scarce regions where green covers are most affected by drought and aridity. More green and blue water resources are required to maintain and expand urban green spaces. Quantifying the water footprint of urban greenery helps to balance greening cities while water saving from both green and blue water resources. We employed remote sensing and artificial intelligence techniques to assess the water consumption and water footprint of a 780&amp;amp;#8208;ha public green space, the Adelaide Parklands in Australia. We estimated the green and blue water footprint of this green space (containing 29 parks) during 2010-2018 on a monthly basis. Our results showed that the mean total water footprint of the Adelaide Parklands was about 7.75 gigaliter per annum over 2010-2018; it varied from 7.19 gigaliter/year in 2018 to 8.45 gigaliter/year in 2012. The blue water footprint was consistently higher than the green water footprint even in wet time of the year. We suggest implementing sponge city and water sensitive urban design (WSUD) techniques to help greening cities while reducing the water footprint of urban green spaces. These approaches have the potential to lessen the pressure on blue water resources and optimise the consumption of green water resources.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu21-100,"",,
rayyan-224209392,"A Machine Learning Sustainable Development Goals Model for Water Resources Serious Gaming. Case Study: &amp;#160;Combeima River, Colombia.",,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The importance of knowing and representing rural and urban development in water management is vital for its sustainability.&amp;amp;#160; An essential part of the management required that stakeholders are more aware of the consequences of decisions and in some way, can link decisions towards sustainability.&amp;amp;#160; For this, a mobile app serious game called Water Citizens has been proposed as knowledge dissemination and to provide a better understanding of the way decisions affect Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). A complex model of a pilot region (Combeima in Ibague, Colombia) has been developed, and the model results are few into equations to estimate fluctuations of SDGs in the region. Running this complex model in real-time, for a mobile application, requires an extensive high-performance computing system linked to large and complex network setup. To solve this problem, a fast yet accurate surrogate model is proposed.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Therefore, this study contemplates an analysis of methods to forecast sustainable development indicators evaluated through climate change scenarios for a period between 1989-2039. The proposed scenarios associated the public health, livestock, agriculture, engineering, education and environment sectors with climate variables, climate change projections, land cover and land use, water demands (domestic, agricultural and livestock) and water quality (BOD and TSS). Generating the possibility that each player can make decisions that represent the actions that affect or contribute to the demand, availability and quality of water in the region.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Consequently, a set of indicators were selected to recreate the dimensions of each sector and reflect its relationship with the Sustainable Development Objectives, as opposed to the decisions made by each player. In addition, three categories were considered for the levels of sustainability: low (0.0 - 0.33), medium (0.34 - 0.66) and high (0.67 - 1.0) for the calculated SDG values.&amp;amp;#160;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Self-learning techniques have been employed in the analysis of decision-making problems. In this study, the nearest K neighbours (k-NN) and a multilayer perceptron network (MLP) were used. Through an analysis based on the responses of the players and sustainability indexes, a multiple correlation analysis was developed in order to consolidate the learning dataset, which was randomly partitioned in proportions 0.7 and 0.3 for the training and test subsets respectively. Subsequently, the model fit and performance was carried out, analysing the MSE error metric and confusion matrix.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Finally, the results of this study will allow to determine the potential of supervised learning models as a decision-making tool for the evaluation of sustainable development, as well as to obtain a better abstraction and representation of the water resource to the challenges related to climate adaptation and water sustainability measures of citizen action, besides generating new approaches for the use of artificial intelligence in land use planning and climate adaptation processes.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu21-13929,"",,
rayyan-224209619,Using Numerical Simulation and Artificial Neural Networks to Investigate the Influence of Flood Control Infrastructures,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"In recent years, global warming has increased the frequency and severity of extreme storm events, super typhoons, and short-duration and high-intensity rainfall events. Along with the growing awareness of sustainable development, Low Impact Development (LID) techniques are advocated to mitigate the impact on the environment to reduce surface runoff and to reduce the heat island effect. The main purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of different stormwater facilities for different storm sizes on urban areas. The study areas are the flood-prone areas of Tu-Cheng downstream. In this study, four different cases are designed for comparison with the LID approach, including non-stormwater facilities, drainage channels with lower (silty loam) or higher (sandy clay load) infiltration rates, and drainage channels with lower infiltration rates and retention storage ponds. The FLO-2D model is applied for two-dimension flood distribution on the study areas of different designed cases, and Self-Organizing Map (SOM) is used to categorize the simulation data into a meaningful and visible inundation topology for displaying the regional flood inundation extents and severity of these four cases.Keywords:Artificial Neural Networks, Self-Organizing Map (SOM), Numerical Simulation, FLO-2D, Flood mitigation facilities, Flood InundationOverview:1. IntroductionAbout three to four typhoons hit Taiwan every year and the average annual rainfall is about 2,500 mm. The rainfall is concentrated in May to November each year which brings abundant water to Taiwan. However, due to the high development of Taiwan's cities, the buildings are so dense that the impervious areas are almost covered. In the whole city, the land use has exceeded the load of the natural environment, the soil permeability is poor and the surface runoff has greatly increased, resulting in insufficient drainage facilities to discharge and cause flooding. Therefore, how to increase the urban water retention rate and reduce the impact of urban development on the environment becomes one of the major issues for water resources management.2. PurposeTaking the flooding in the Tu-Cheng area as the research object, the numerical software FLO-2D is used to establish the flooding situation generated by different combinations of Low Impact Development facilities and to explore the best flood reduction effect by LID facilities. In addition, Self-Organizing Map (SOM) is used to carry out the cluster analysis to explore the correlation characteristics of flood mitigation factors with flooding conditions. Finally, it is expected that the results of this analysis can effectively solve the problem of urban flooding.3. Study areaTu-Cheng district is a municipal district of New Taipei City, with a population of about 240,000 and an area of about 30 square kilometers. It is located in the southwest corner of the Taipei Basin, and the northeast corner is adjacent to Banqiao District. The Southeast is backed by mountains and faces the water. Its location map is listed as vulnerable to flooding. Due to the highly developed and densely populated areas, the loss of flooding can be quite heavy.4. Methodology4.1 FLO-2DThis model is a two-dimensional flood disaster simulation model developed by an American company. It uses a one-dimensional variable flow model and a two-dimensional overland flow model to simulate one-dimensional flow, street flow, and two-dimensional overland flow. When the overflow occurs, the interaction mechanism between the channel outside the embankment and the surface of the embankment can be calculated which can effectively simulate the flooding situation. The model channel calculation method is to use the continuous equation and the dynamic wave model to simulate the finite difference method, simulate the speed and depth of fluid flow and estimate the reasonable submerged area as a flood disaster prediction tool.4.2 Self-Organizing Map (SOM)The SOM, introduced by Kohonen (1982), is a useful clustering method that can classify a large set of high-dimensional data to form a meaningful topological map derived from the low-dimensional (usually two-dimensional) output layer of the network. The topological map can be used to visibly conduct an assessment of the behavior of input variables and the multi-relations among variables through the constructed clusters. The SOM has advantages of information extraction and visualization and has been widely used in water resources problems. 4.3 Low Impact Development (LID)The main purpose of LID is to apply flood retention, infiltration and evaporation that are common in current drainage design and planning, and to increase urban park green space, so as to delay the flood peak when floods come and reduce flood volume to maintain the hydrological state before land development as much as possible.5. Expected resultsThis study is to collect the elevation date distributed in the Tu-Cheng urban area, the rainfall data from the Tu-Chung rainfall stations, and the satellite imagery to build houses, roads and channels. Besides, the purpose is to explore the effect of different flood mitigation facilities on urban flooding. Taking the flooding situation in the downstream easily flooded area of Tu-Chung district as the research object, the numerical software FLO-2D simulated the flooding situation of different flood mitigation facilities. The flood reduction effect of the combination of LID facilities, and use the SOM to conduct cluster analysis to observe the interactive relationship between the trend of flooding and the factors of flood mitigation facilities, and provide the lowest environmental damage and can improve its maximum reduction. 6.

The different artificial intelligence models are proposed to simulate climate parameters of Jinan city in China, include artificial neural network (ANN), recurrent NN (RNN), long short-term memory neural network (LSTM), deep convolutional NN (CNN), and CNN-LSTM. These models are used to forecast six climatic factors on a monthly ahead. The climate data for 72 years (1 January 1951–31 December 2022) used in this study include monthly average atmospheric temperature, extreme minimum atmospheric temperature, extreme maximum atmospheric temperature, precipitation, average relative humidity, and sunlight hours. The time series of 12 month delayed data are used as input signals to the models. The efficiency of the proposed models are examined utilizing diverse evaluation criteria namely mean absolute error, root mean square error (RMSE), and correlation coefficient (R). The modeling result inherits that the proposed hybrid CNN-LSTM model achieves a greater accuracy than other compared models. The hybrid CNN-LSTM model significantly reduces the forecasting error compared to the models for the one month time step ahead. For instance, the RMSE values of the ANN, RNN, LSTM, CNN, and CNN-LSTM models for monthly average atmospheric temperature in the forecasting stage are 2.0669, 1.4416, 1.3482, 0.8015 and 0.6292 °C, respectively. The findings of climate simulations shows the potential of CNN-LSTM models to improve climate forecasting.

Besides the existing rainfall measurement systems, citizen science can offer unconventional methods to provide complementary rainfall data for enhancing spatial and temporal data coverage. This demand for accurate rainfall data is particularly crucial in the context of smart city innovations, where real-time weather information is essential for effective urban planning, flood management, and environmental sustainability. Therefore, this study provides proof-of-concept for a novel method of estimating rainfall intensity using its recorded audio in an urban area, which can be incorporated into a smart city as part of its real-time weather forecasting system. This study proposes a convolutional neural network (CNN) inversion model for acoustic rainfall intensity estimation. The developed CNN rainfall sensing model showed a significant improvement in performance over the traditional approach, which relies on the loudness feature as an input, especially for simulating rainfall intensities above 60 mm/h. Also, a CNN-based denoising framework was developed to attenuate unwanted noises in rainfall recordings, which achieved up to 98% accuracy on the validation and testing datasets. This study and its promising results are a step towards developing an acoustic rainfall sensing tool for citizen-science applications in smart cities.

To improve LULCC prediction, this study proposes the use of a random forest regression (RFR) model, in comparison with logistic regression–cellular automata (LR-CA) and artificial neural network–cellular automata (ANN-CA), for the prediction of LULCC (2019–2030) in the Gaborone dam catchment (Botswana). RFR is proposed as it is able to capture the existing and potential interactions between the LULC intensity and their nonlinear interactions with the change-driving factors. For LULCC forecasting, the driving factors comprised physiographic variables (elevation, slope and aspect) and proximity-neighborhood factors (distances to water bodies, roads and urban areas). In simulating the historical LULC (1986–2019) at 5-year time steps, RFR outperformed ANN-CA and LR-CA models with respective percentage accuracies of 84.9%, 62.1% and 60.7%. Using the RFR model, the predicted LULCCs were determined as vegetation (−8.9%), bare soil (+8.9%), built-up (+2.49%) and cropland (−2.8%), with water bodies exhibiting insignificant change. The correlation between land use (built-up areas) and water depicted an increasing population against decreasing dam water capacity. The study approach has the potential for deriving the catchment land–water nexus, which can aid in the formulation of sustainable catchment monitoring and development strategies.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/su16041699,"",,

In the Kurdistan Region of Iraq (KRI), there is a good amount of precipitation, surface water, and groundwater, but the main issue is mismanagement of those sources. Rainfall is one of the major sources of water resources in KRI. In order to manage the available water resources and prevent natural disasters such as floods and droughts, there is a need for reliable models for forecasting rainfall. The current study focuses on developing a hybrid model, namely seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average combined with an artificial neural network (SARIMA-ANN) for forecasting monthly rainfall at Sulaymaniyah City for the duration of 1938–2012. For comparison purposes, a conventional machine learning model, namely artificial neural networks (ANN) has been applied on the same data. Two different statistical measurements, namely, root mean square error (RMSE) and coefficient of determination (R2), have been used to check the accuracy of the proposed models. According to the findings, SARIMA-ANN outperformed ANN with RMSE = 11.5, RMSE = 51.002, R2 = 0.98, R2 = 0.43, respectively.

rayyan-224210029,An Intelligent Water Monitoring IoT System for Ecological Environment and Smart Cities,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Global precipitation is becoming increasingly intense due to the extreme climate. Therefore, creating new technology to manage water resources is crucial. To create a sustainable urban and ecological environment, a water level and water quality control system implementing artificial intelligence is presented in this research. The proposed smart monitoring system consists of four sensors (two different liquid level sensors, a turbidity and pH sensor, and a water oxygen sensor), a control module (an MCU, a motor, a pump, and a drain), and a power and communication system (a solar panel, a battery, and a wireless communication module). The system focuses on low-cost Internet of Things (IoT) devices along with low power consumption and high precision. This proposal collects rainfall from the preceding 10 years in the application region as well as the region's meteorological bureau's weekly weather report and uses artificial intelligence to compute the appropriate water level. More importantly, the adoption of dynamic adjustment systems can reserve and modify water resources in the application region more efficiently. Compared to existing technologies, the measurement approach utilized in this study not only achieves cost savings exceeding 60% but also enhances water level measurement accuracy by over 15% through the successful implementation of water level calibration decisions utilizing multiple distinct sensors. Of greater significance, the dynamic adjustment systems proposed in this research offer the potential for conserving water resources by more than 15% in an effective manner. As a result, the adoption of this technology may efficiently reserve and distribute water resources for smart cities as well as reduce substantial losses caused by anomalous water resources, such as floods, droughts, and ecological concerns.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/s23208540,"",,
rayyan-224210326,Early Flood Monitoring and Forecasting System Using a Hybrid Machine Learning-Based Approach,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"The occurrence of flash floods in urban catchments within the Mediterranean climate zone has witnessed a substantial rise due to climate change, underscoring the urgent need for early-warning systems. This paper examines the implementation of an early flood monitoring and forecasting system (EMFS) to predict the critical overflow level of a small urban stream on Lesvos Island, Greece, which has a history of severe flash flood incidents requiring rapid response. The system is supported by a network of telemetric stations that measure meteorological and hydrometric parameters in real time, with a time step accuracy of 15 min. The collected data are fed into the physical Hydrologic Engineering Center’s Hydrologic Modeling System (HEC-HMS), which simulates the stream’s discharge. Considering the HEC-HMS’s estimated outflow and other hydro-meteorological parameters, the EMFS uses long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks to enhance the accuracy of flood prediction. In particular, LSTMs are employed to analyze the real-time data from the telemetric stations and make multi-step predictions of the critical water level. Hydrological time series data are utilized to train and validate the LSTM models for short-term leading times of 15 min, 30 min, 45 min, and 1 h. By combining the predictions obtained by the HEC-HMS with those of the LSTMs, the EMFS can produce accurate flood forecasts. The results indicate that the proposed methodology yields trustworthy behavior in enhancing the overall resilience of the area against flash floods.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/ijgi12110464,"",,
rayyan-224210344,Role of Satellite Precipitation Products in Real-Time Predictions of Urban Rainfall-Runoff by Using Machine Learning Modelling,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"The accurate prediction of runoff features such as water level and flow is valuable for planning and operation of urban drainage systems (UDS), especially for appropriately acting as flood control mechanisms during extreme rainfall events which are constantly impacted by climate change variables [1]. In addition, cost-effective design, and operation of flood control measures such as smart UDS require highly accurate rainfall predictions across the catchment area, i.e., intensity and duration [2]. Furthermore, sufficient lead time is needed to activate the control mechanisms on the UDS without affecting the accuracy of the predictions. It seems that the emerging use of satellite precipitation products (SPPs) is promising for obtaining predictions with longer lead times [3]. Hence, more exploration of potential runoff predictions by using SPPs is worth investigating to achieve a more accurate and longer lead time.This study employs a type of SPPs i.e., global precipitation measurement-integrated multi-satellite retrieval product (GPM-IMERG) to predict rainfall-runoff duration, peak and volume, as well as changes in flow over the course of the event at 30-minute intervals. In order to train and validate the machine learning model, the data from GPM-IMERG V06 was merged with ground data from the catchment precipitation gauge and flow sensor. The methodology is demonstrated by its application to the rainfall-runoff modelling of a real-world small urban sub-catchment area and its performance is evaluated by comparing it with the runoff predictions from physically based simulation models [4].Results show that while using SPPs solely can provide accurate predictions, significant improvement can be obtained when this data is integrated with ground monitoring data. The model output can be utilised for better design, planning and management of UDS technologies as flood control tools and consequently real-time operation of UDS in urban flooding.[1] Ferrans, P., Torres, M., Temprano, J., S&amp;#225;nchez, J., (2022).

This review explores the potential of stormwater management strategies and Artificial Intelligence modeling tools in enhancing water quality. The study focuses on evaluating stormwater modeling tools for planning and improving stormwater systems, assessing modeling efficiency, and understanding the impacts of new development on stormwater runoff and water quality. Various stormwater modeling tools are compared to aid in water management in urban and rural settings, which is crucial due to increasing storm intensity from climate change. The review debates the advantages and limitations of different modeling tools, particularly in modeling stormwater quantity and quality under different scenarios.

The assessment of modeling tools is centred on their support for Green Infrastructure (GI) practices, considering factors like modeling accuracy, data availability, and requirements. The study highlights the importance of these tools in managing water in urban areas and safeguarding water sources during stormwater events.

Climate change is a worldwide problem that affects and will continue to affect the frequency and intensity of natural disasters in many regions of the world. Tunceli region in Turkey, which until 10 years ago was known as an environmentally friendly city with abundant water resources and frequent rainfall, is experiencing a decrease in precipitation during the snowy winter season. This situation has made the investigation of climate change impacts an important issue in the region. Therefore, effective climate change adaptation strategies need to be developed. To determine these strategies, in this study, we assessed long-term drought conditions using multiple drought indices such as Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), Reconnaissance Drought Index (RDI), Normal Precipitation Index (PNI), and Aridity Index (AI). The SPI and RDI analyses were performed in annual reference periods on a time scale of 3, 6, 9, and 12 months using temperature, precipitation, and evaporation data. Consequently, the SPI and RDI results were compared, and both indices show similar behavior in dry, wet, and normal seasons. Nevertheless, RDI shows less variation between different time scales, which is an advantage over SPI and is probably due to the inclusion of potential evapotranspiration in RDI. The variations in PNI between humid and dry sub-humid categorizations throughout the years, combined with the AI results, indicate that the Tunceli region predominantly experiences a climate ranging from dry sub-humid to semi-arid. This study could help decision-makers take effective measures to become more resilient to climate change in temperate climate regions and take important steps toward sustainable water resources management.","",https://doi.org/10.1007/s41101-024-00281-9,"",,
rayyan-224210493,Proposed Smart Water Management System,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Human activities, such as farming, heavy industries, energy generation and mining, significantly demand water resources necessary for life. With the population and water demand increasing, water must be efficiently managed to meet human needs with sufficient supply to protect our ecosystems. Reduced aquifer levels worldwide render human civilization vulnerable to escalating climate change. This paper proposes a priority-based embedded smart water management system based on FreeRTOS technology to address a unique problem where existing water supply systems are inefficiently managed due to the absence of a need-based allocation methodology. Sustainability can be achieved by maintaining a real-time balance of supply and demand to disperse the limited water supply. With FreeRTOS backbone, the proposed system can be fully integrated into an AI-based infrastructure to manage water supply with minimum human intervention efficiently. This research demonstrated that a priority-based real-time water resource distribution system could contribute up to 40% of water management improvement for buildings, farms, and cities.","",https://doi.org/10.1109/aca57612.2023.10346741,"",,

One of the major challenges is the quick and accurate detection of leaks, which can lead to water loss, infrastructure damage, and environmental hazards. Many existing leak detection methods are ineffective, especially in complex and aging pipeline networks. If these limitations are not overcome, it can result in a chain of infrastructure failures, exacerbating damage, increasing repair costs, and causing water shortages and public health risks. The leak issue is further complicated by increasing urban water demand, climate change, and population growth. Therefore, there is an urgent need for intelligent systems that can overcome the limitations of traditional methodologies and leverage sophisticated data analysis and machine learning technologies. In this study, we propose a reliable and advanced method for detecting leaks in water pipes using a framework based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks combined with autoencoders. The framework is designed to manage the temporal dimension of time-series data and is enhanced with ensemble learning techniques, making it sensitive to subtle signals indicating leaks while robustly dealing with noise signals. Through the integration of signal processing and pattern recognition, the machine learning-based model addresses the leak detection problem, providing an intelligent system that enhances environmental protection and resource management.

Observed stream water quality data are usually sparse in both time and space. Reconstruction of water quality time series using surrogate variables such as streamflow have been used to evaluate risk metrics such as reliability, resilience, vulnerability, and watershed health (WH) but only at gauged locations. Estimating these indices for ungauged watersheds has not been attempted because of the high-dimensional nature of the potential predictor space. In this study, machine learning (ML) models, namely random forest regression, AdaBoost, gradient boosting machines, and Bayesian ridge regression (along with an ensemble model), were evaluated to predict watershed health and other risk metrics at ungauged hydrologic unit code 10 (HUC-10) basins using watershed attributes, long-term climate data, soil data, land use and land cover data, fertilizer sales data, and geographic information as predictor variables. These ML models were tested over the Upper Mississippi River Basin, the Ohio River Basin, and the Maumee River Basin for water quality constituents such as suspended sediment concentration, nitrogen, and phosphorus. Random forest, AdaBoost, and gradient boosting regressors typically showed a coefficient of determination R2&gt;0.8 for suspended sediment concentration and nitrogen during the testing stage, while the ensemble model exhibited R2&gt;0.95. Watershed health values with respect to suspended sediments and nitrogen predicted by all ML models including the ensemble model were lower for areas with larger agricultural land use, moderate for areas with predominant urban land use, and higher for forested areas; the trained ML models adequately predicted WH in ungauged basins. However, low WH values (with respect to phosphorus) were predicted at some basins in the Upper Mississippi River Basin that had dominant forest land use. Results suggest that the proposed ML models provide robust estimates at ungauged locations when sufficient training data are available for a WQ constituent. ML models may be used as quick screening tools by decision makers and water quality monitoring agencies for identifying critical source areas or hotspots with respect to different water quality constituents, even for ungauged watersheds.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/w15030586,"",,

Fourteen percent of the total water withdrawal in the United States is used for public supply, typically including deliveries to domestic, commercial, and occasionally including industrial, irrigation, and thermoelectric water withdrawal. Stewards of water resources in the USA require estimates of water withdrawals to manage and plan for future demands and sustainable water supplies. This study compiled the most comprehensive conterminous United States water withdrawal data set to date and developed a machine learning framework for estimating public supply withdrawals and associated uncertainty for the period 2000–2020. The modeling approach provides service area resolution estimates to allow for annual and monthly water withdrawal estimation while incorporating a complex array of driving factors that include hydroclimatic, demographic, socioeconomic, geographic, and land use factors. Model results reveal highly variable and lognormally distributed per‐capita water withdrawal, spanning from 30 to 650 gallons per capita per day (GPCD), across community, regional, and national scales, with pronounced seasonal variations. Analysis of estimated withdrawal trends indicates that the national annual average withdrawal experienced a decline at a rate of 0.58 GPCD/year during the period from 2000 to 2020. Model interpretation reveals a complex interplay between public supply withdrawal and key predictors, including population size, warm‐season precipitation, counts of large buildings and houses, and areas of urban and commercial land use.

rayyan-224210975,"Use of Machine Learning and Indexing Techniques for Identifying Industrial Pollutant Sources: A Case Study of the Lower Kelani River Basin, Sri Lanka",,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"With the recent acceleration in urbanisation and industrialisation, industrial pollution has severely impacted inland water bodies and ecosystem services globally, causing significant restrains to freshwater availability and myriad damages to benthic species. The Kelani River Basin in Sri Lanka, covering only ~3.6% of the land but hosting over a quarter of its population and many industrial zones, is identified as the most polluted watershed in the country. This study used unsupervised learning (UL) and an indexing approach to identify potential industrial pollutant sources along the Kelani River. The UL results were compared with those obtained from a novel Industrial Pollution Index (IPI). Three latent variables related to industrial pollution were identified via Factor Analysis of monthly water quality data from 17 monitoring stations from 2016 to 2020. The developed IPI was validated using a Long Short-Term Memory Artificial Neural Network model (NSE = 0.98, RMSE = 0.81), identifying Cd, Zn, and Fe as the primary parameters influencing river pollution status. The UL method identified five stations with elevated concentrations for the developed latent variables, and the IPI confirmed four of them. Based on the findings from both methods, the industrial zones along the Kelani River have emerged as a likely source of pollution in the river’s water. The results suggest that the proposed method effectively identifies industrial pollution sources, offering a scalable methodology for other river basins to ensure sustainable water resource management.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/w16192766,"",,
rayyan-224211044,Development of a Multi-Scale Groundwater Drought Prediction Model Using Deep Learning and Hydrometeorological Data,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Groundwater is an essential water resource and plays a crucial role, especially in areas with limited surface water availability. However, the exacerbation of groundwater droughts, fueled by phenomena such as climate change, urbanization, and industrialization, highlights the necessity for predictive tools to aid in sustainable groundwater management. While artificial neural networks (ANN) have been increasingly used for groundwater level prediction, most studies have focused solely on point-scale predictions from groundwater observation wells, which can be resource-intensive and time-consuming. In this study, we propose a multi-scale groundwater-based drought prediction model that can predict both zonal average values and the values at well locations for the standardized groundwater level index (SGI). Specifically, we develop a zone-scale SGI prediction model through long short-term memory (LSTM) and propose a model that can accurately predict point-scale SGI through a simple downscaling process. Our model was developed and tested for Jeju Island, a volcanic island in South Korea where groundwater serves as the primary water source. Specifically, we partitioned Jeju Island into 16 sub-watersheds, termed zones, and constructed an individual model for each zone. Forecasting the standardized groundwater level index (SGI) for each zone was based on input datasets including the daily temperature, precipitation, snowfall, vapor pressure deficit (VPD), wind speed, and preceding SGI values. Additionally, we downscaled the predicted values of each zone to the specific SGI values at groundwater monitoring wells within the zone. This was achieved by applying the spatial deviation of each well relative to the zonal mean over the preceding 4 days to the predicted zone-scale SGI value. Our findings indicate high accuracy of the model in SGI predictions across both scales, with the Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (NSE) exceeding 0.9 and the root mean square error (RMSE) remaining less than 0.3 for both the representative zone and observation well. By leveraging the proposed model, stakeholders and policymakers can efficiently generate and utilize both zone-scale and point-scale groundwater-based drought predictions, contributing to effective groundwater management practices.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/w16142036,"",,
rayyan-224211097,"Trees, society, and the path toward resilient ecosystems",,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Over 3 trillion trees occupy the Earth's land surface, mostly in tropical and subtropical forests. These trees provide vital ecosystem services, such as climate regulation, carbon sequestration, and habitat and food provision. Trees are also deeply interconnected with humans, offering social and cultural values. The interdependence between trees and humans underlines the urgency to understand and protect trees in both natural and urban ecosystems amid climate change and other environmental pressures, including deforestation, land degradation, and pollution. This virtual issue examines five critical themes of trees and forests and their societal impact. Over 3 trillion trees occupy the Earth's land surface, mostly in tropical and subtropical forests (~1.3 trillion) (Crowther et al., 2015). These trees provide vital ecosystem services, such as climate regulation, carbon sequestration, and habitat and food provision (Brockerhoff et al., 2017; Myers, 1997). Trees are also deeply interconnected with humans, offering social and cultural values (O'Brien, 2005). The interdependence between trees and humans underlines the urgency to understand and protect trees in both natural and urban ecosystems amid climate change and other environmental pressures, including deforestation, land degradation, and pollution (De Marco et al., 2022; Esperon-Rodriguez, Tjoelker, et al., 2022; Kumar et al., 2022; Lindner et al., 2010). This virtual issue examines five critical themes of trees and forests and their societal impact. Each theme provides insights into cultural significance, ecosystem contributions, resilience and restoration, and technological innovations in conservation. In 'Climate Resilience and Adaptive Strategies of Trees', researchers investigate how trees adapt to climate change through resilience and genetic diversity with studies on urban forest adaptation, genetic variation, and seasonal responses of tree species. 'Forest Restoration and Biodiversity Conservation' shows strategies that enhance biodiversity and climate mitigation with diverse reforestation practices. In 'Trees and Human Culture', the research explores the cultural value of trees, focusing on the historical and societal importance of native and commercial species and their role in local traditions and economies. The authors of work featured in 'Trees as Ecosystem Engineers' highlight how trees contribute to biodiversity and support livelihoods, with studies on societal perceptions, species interactions, and endemic conservation efforts. Lastly, 'Technological Advances in Forest Monitoring and Conservation' delves into tools like UAVs and genetic analyses that aid in monitoring and preserving forests. Together, these themes offer a comprehensive view of trees' essential roles across ecosystems, human culture, and emerging conservation efforts. As a response to climate change and urbanization, researchers highlight the need to enhance urban forest resilience. Urban forests, essential for decreasing urban heat and improving air quality and human well-being (Keeler et al., 2019), face risks from climate-induced stress. To secure the provision of these benefits to urban residents, Esperon-Rodriguez, Rymer, et al. (2022) emphasize the importance of selecting tree species suited to the projected climate conditions in cities along with other desirable characteristics, such as aesthetic value and biodiversity support. By assessing the risks to heat, drought, and pest outbreaks, urban planners can make informed decisions to increase the longevity of urban trees and secure the services they provide (Esperon-Rodriguez, Rymer, et al., 2022). Urban environments present unique challenges and opportunities for tree resilience. Sjöman et al. (2024) examined how genetic diversity within tree species (i.e., intraspecific variation) supports resilience to urban stresses, such as pollution and limited water availability. The authors suggest that by focusing on resilient tree varieties, urban forestry initiatives can improve biodiversity and ecosystem function within cities, fostering healthier urban landscapes that also contribute to climate resilience. Species, however, respond differently to local environmental conditions. For example, Goessen et al. (2022) explored how tree species have diverse adaptations driven by geographic conditions. Their study focused on Populus tremuloides, or Quaking aspen, a species native to North America, has developed divergent strategies in response to local environmental constraints, reflecting the role of genetic diversity in resilience. In Japan, Miyawaki-Kuwakado et al. (2024) investigated how warming temperatures affect the timing of seasonal events like bud dormancy. Their research on the iconic Yoshino cherry tree (Cerasus × yedoensis) showed that climate change may lead to mistimed flowering. Such shifts threaten species reliant on specific climatic triggers, raising concerns about the long-term viability of temperature-sensitive species in changing climates. Importantly, these changes can also have socio-economic disruptions, as the blossoming of cherries is an important tourism resource (Murata et al., 2012). Similar results were found in the Singapore Botanic Gardens, where Ho et al. (2024) conducted a long-term assessment of changes in leafing behavior of tropical trees in response to climate change. They found that tropical trees can adjust their leafing behavior over extended periods, showcasing their adaptive capacity. By focusing on adaptive capacity, genetic diversity, and optimal species selection, this research offers pathways to enhance forest resilience and sustain the ecological and social benefits that trees provide. Forest restoration plays a critical role in climate change mitigation and biodiversity conservation as global efforts aim to reverse deforestation and land degradation (Bastin et al., 2019). Andres et al. (2023) sought to define the term ""biodiverse reforestation"" and explained why this matters for climate change mitigation and biodiversity. The authors emphasize the importance of integrating biodiversity goals into reforestation efforts. By prioritizing species diversity, reforestation projects can sequester carbon more effectively while supporting ecosystem functions and species. This represents a more resilient and sustainable approach to forest restoration. Importantly, the authors consider the potential for improving scientific approaches to biodiverse reforestation with First Nations perspectives. The co-benefits of Indigenous knowledge and values have been recognized as vital to climate adaptation (Nursey-Bray et al., 2022). In restoration, ensuring water efficiency in seedlings is crucial, especially under climate stress. Krishnan et al. (2023) examined how organic nitrogen can enhance water-use efficiency in tropical tree seedlings. They showed that nutrient addition allowed seedlings to establish more effectively under dry conditions, suggesting practical strategies for forest restoration projects in arid regions. This has important repercussions not only for restoration but also for food production. For example, in regions where food security and forest health are closely linked, selecting appropriate tree species is essential. A study in Burkina Faso, West Africa, by Vinceti et al. (2022) explored how tree species contribute to both ecological restoration and local nutrition. By including species that provide food, like fruit-bearing trees, reforestation initiatives in Burkina Faso can address both environmental and community needs, creating landscapes that support biodiversity while improving food security. Local and small-scale efforts, such as home gardens, also play a significant role in supporting biodiversity and for conservation. Offord and Zimmer (2024) studied how home gardeners help preserve the critically endangered Wollemi Pine (Wollemia nobilis). This species native to Australia was described as new to science in 1994 and is represented by fewer than 100 individuals (Trueman et al., 2007). By cultivating Wollemi Pine in private gardens, individuals contribute to broader conservation goals, ensuring genetic diversity and supporting efforts to reintroduce the species into its natural habitat (Offord & Zimmer, 2024). This approach highlights the value of community-based conservation in supporting endangered species and enhancing biodiversity. Trees and forests have profound cultural and economic value, reflecting centuries of human interaction and local knowledge (O'Brien, 2005). Recent research investigates the cultural, economic, and social significance of tree species, focusing on the importance of identity, naming, and preservation of species. Dunbar-Wallis et al. (2023) highlight the significance of preserving historic North American apple (Malus domestica) varieties. Their study showed how naming and identifying these apples maintain cultural heritage and biodiversity. North American apples represent historical practices and tastes, underscoring the importance of preserving these genetic resources as part of local identity and resilience. Notably, M. domestica is one of the most cultivated fruits worldwide (ranked fourth) with an average annual production of over 85 million tons globally (FAOSTAT, 2020). For the wild apple (Malus sylvestris), Ruhsam et al. (2023) took the challenge of accurately identifying the nursery stock sold in nurseries from the United Kingdom. Wild apple species are vital for genetic diversity and resilience, and ensuring authenticity in nursery stock is crucial for conservation. This research highlights the importance of preserving genetic integrity and maintaining access to wild species, which are valuable for both biodiversity and cultural heritage. Studying a culturally significant species, the barnī date palm variety, a local elite variety of al-'Ulā oasis in Saudi Arabia, Gros-Balthazard et al. (2023) found that this variety is not only an economic staple but also a cultural icon in the region. Through its name and cultivation, the barnī date palm represents a rich heritage that has sustained communities for generations, illustrating how plant varieties can embody place-based knowledge and cultural ties. In a similar study, Gurung et al. (2024) explored the cultural and medicinal significance of Buddleja asiatica, a shrub native to the East Indies. In the Pan-Himalayan region, this species is integral to local healthcare practices, providing essential medicinal benefits to communities. Its use reflects a traditional knowledge system and highlights the symbiotic relationship between people and native plant species, demonstrating the role of trees in supporting cultural identity and local health. Trees as ecosystem engineers (i.e., organisms responsible for the creation and maintenance of habitats; Jones et al., 1996) can change the abiotic context upon which biotic interactions depend (Byers et al., 2006). Thus, community livelihoods rely on identifying threats and benefits provided by trees. Tsvuura et al. (2023) explored gender perspectives on the perceived benefits and threats of tree restoration in South Africa. They explored how communities view trees as valuable contributors to their livelihoods, recognizing the critical role trees play in providing resources such as timber, fruit, and medicinal products. However, this study also highlights concerns regarding threats to these benefits, such as climate change, deforestation, and urbanization. These threats challenge the sustainability of the services that communities depend on, underscoring the need for strategies that secure tree resources while balancing conservation and economic needs (Sivakumar et al., 2024). In Yemen, Maděra et al. (2024) studied 11 endemic frankincense tree (Boswellia) taxa in the Socotra Archipelago. These species are culturally and economically valuable to local communities. However, frankincense trees are also threatened by overharvesting, habitat loss, and climate change, threatening local biodiversity and the communities reliant on them for livelihood. Maděra et al.'s study provides a detailed ecological assessment identifying regions at most risk and offers insights into conservation strategies that balance sustainable use with the preservation of genetic diversity. The conservation of frankincense trees is critical not only for the ecosystem but also for supporting traditional practices and economic stability for people in the region. As hosts for other species, trees can develop complex interactions, such as the relationship between strangler figs and their host trees, studied by Mo et al. (2024). Strangler figs start life on host trees, gradually growing and often overtaking the host tree's structure. While this interaction may seem parasitic, it can enhance urban green spaces by adding unique biodiversity and aesthetic value. This study suggests that, when managed properly, strangler figs can enrich urban ecosystems by creating microhabitats for multiple species, supporting urban biodiversity, and improving the resilience of green spaces (Mo et al., 2024). This research highlights the dual ecological and cultural significance of these trees in urban landscapes. Modern technologies like AI, UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles), and genetic tools are shaping a new era in the conservation, management, and monitoring of forests worldwide. By combining UAV surveys, genetic analysis, advanced forestry tools, and ground-based monitoring, researchers and managers can make informed decisions about forest conservation and sustainable use. These technologies not only improve our understanding of forest ecosystems but also facilitate enforcing regulations, planning conservation strategies, and adapting to climate change impacts on forests. In Madagascar, Williams (2024) used UAVs to monitor deforestation in real-time. Madagascar harbors a unique biodiversity, but this is threatened by illegal logging (Ralimanana et al., 2022). UAVs enable rapid, cost-effective detection of deforestation, offering precise data on forest loss and allowing authorities to respond promptly to illegal activities (Williams, 2024). In a global review of emerging tools to support sustainable forestry, Bunney et al. (2023) focused on protecting sandalwood species (a variety of species in the family Santalaceae), which are culturally and economically valuable and threatened by overharvesting. This review examined different methods, including DNA barcoding, to verify the species of harvested wood and remote sensing for forest monitoring. Together, these studies demonstrate the importance of combining drones, remote sensing, and genetic tools for comprehensive forest conservation strategies. The role of genomics in understanding the resilience of tree species was studied by Kong et al. (2023). Prosopis alba, native to arid environments, possesses genetic traits that allow it to withstand extreme drought and saline conditions. By mapping the genome of P. alba, Kong et al. demonstrated species adaptability, which can inform breeding programs aimed at enhancing the resilience of trees in regions facing water scarcity and climate stress. Genomic tools enable targeted conservation of tree species that are vital to ecosystem stability in extreme climates (Isabel et al., 2020). Finally, in a study using ground-based data, Anderson-Teixeira et al. (2024) showed that effective forest carbon inventories require precise measurements of carbon stocks. Technologies such as remote sensing paired with field data can provide reliable estimates. This approach enhances the accuracy of reporting forest carbon, helping countries meet their climate goals and track the effectiveness of conservation efforts. Collectively, these studies show the essential roles that trees play in both natural and urban environments, particularly in the face of climate change and environmental pressures. They reveal how trees adapt to climate changes, underscoring the importance of genetic diversity and adaptive strategies to strengthen climate-resilient forestry. This knowledge supports informed species selection and management to foster resilient forests that benefit both ecosystems and communities. A multi-faceted approach to forest restoration, one that incorporates ecological, cultural, and social factors, emerges as crucial for sustaining biodiversity while meeting community needs. These studies highlight trees as cultural symbols and economic resources, essential for preserving cultural identity and biodiversity. Trees also serve as ecosystem engineers, offering ecosystem services that support biodiversity, air quality, and water regulation, while facing significant threats from human impact. Notably, technological advancements and emerging tools are transforming forest conservation and monitoring, providing researchers with tools to better protect and manage forest ecosystems. Together, these studies provide insights and innovations toward more sustainable and resilient ecosystems that benefit both the environment and society. MER wrote this article.

rayyan-224211102,"The limitation of machine learning methods for water supply and demand forecasting: A case study for Greater Melbourne, Australia",,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"ABSTRACT Many cities around the world have faced water scarcity due to climate change, population growth, and urbanization. Accurate water supply and demand forecasting is critical for sustainable urban water management. Machine learning (ML) models provide new possibilities for forecasting compared with traditional models in handling non-linearity. This study aims to address the efficacy of ML models, long short-term memory (LSTM), stacked LSTM, bidirectional LSTM (Bi-LSTM), and multilayer perceptron (MLP), for forecasting water supply and demand in Greater Melbourne, Australia. The ML modelling utilized daily water supply and demand, and climatic variables (rainfall and maximum temperature) recorded by Melbourne Water and the Bureau of Meteorology from 1990 to 2019. The stacked LSTM performs better than other models in forecasting with R2, RMSE, and MAPE values of 0.908, 335.74 ML, and 23.5% for water supply and 0.791, 94.88 ML, and 5.3% for water demand, respectively. The inclusion of climatic variables enhanced the accuracy of forecasting by improving R2 and reducing RMSE and MAPE. The results indicate effectiveness of ML models, particularly LSTM-based architectures, in forecasting water supply and demand. However, these models have limitations, particularly in forecasting extreme values, emphasizing the need to improve ML models for more reliable and accurate water management.","",https://doi.org/10.2166/ws.2024.225,"",,

It is essential to explore the current status of water use patterns and future development directions in Zhangye City. In this study, 17 factors affecting water consumption in Zhangye City were selected to analyze changes in water consumption and to predict values from 2003 to 2022, utilizing the entropy weight–VIKOR model and the grey neural network model. The results indicate that agricultural water consumption and annual rainfall are the factors with the largest weights among the social and natural attribute indicators, respectively, significantly influencing water consumption in Zhangye City. As the proportions of water consumption for forestry, animal husbandry, fishery, livestock, urban public use, and ecological environment increase, while agricultural water consumption continues to decline, the overall water consumption trend in Zhangye City from 2003 to 2022 shows a positive trajectory. Each water consumption factor is tending toward greater balance, and the relationship between water supply and distribution is improving. The multi-year average relative error of the water consumption predictions for Zhangye City from 2003 to 2022 using the grey neural network model was 4.28%. Furthermore, the relative error values for annual predictions ranged from 0.60% to 5.00%, achieving an accuracy rate of 80.00%. This indicates a strong predictive performance. Ultimately, the model was used to predict a water consumption of 20.18 × 108 m3 in Zhangye City in 2027. The model can serve as a theoretical reference for short-term water consumption forecasting and for establishing a basin water resource allocation system in Zhangye City.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/atmos15111387,"",,

rayyan-224211257,A deep learning model for real-time forecasting of 2-D river flood inundation maps,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract. Floods are among the most hazardous natural disasters worldwide. Accurate and rapid flood predictions are critical for effective early warning systems and flood management strategies. The high computational cost of hydrodynamic models often limits their application in real-time flood simulations. Conversely, data-driven models are gaining attention due to their high computational efficiency. In this study, we aim at assessing the effectiveness of transformer-based models for forecasting the spatiotemporal evolution of fluvial floods in real-time. To this end, the transformer-based data-driven model FloodSformer (FS) has been adapted to predict river flood inundations with negligible computational time. The FS model leverages an autoencoder framework to analyze and reduce the dimensionality of spatial information in input water depth maps, while a transformer architecture captures spatiotemporal correlations between inundation maps and inflow discharges using a cross-attention mechanism. The trained model can predict long-lasting events using an autoregressive procedure. The model's performance was evaluated in two case studies: an urban flash flood scenario at the laboratory scale and a river flood scenario along a segment of the Po River (Italy). Datasets were numerically generated using a two-dimensional hydrodynamic model. Special attention was given to analyzing how the accuracy of predictions is influenced by the type and severity of flood events used to create the training dataset. The results show that prediction errors generally align with the uncertainty observed in physically based models, and that larger and more diverse training datasets help improving the model's accuracy. Additionally, the computational time of the real-time forecasting procedure is negligible compared to the physical time of the simulated event. The performance of the FS model was also benchmarked against a state-of-the-art convolutional neural network architecture and showed better accuracy. These findings highlight the potential of transformer-based models in enhancing flood prediction accuracy and responsiveness, contributing to improve flood management and resilience.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-2024-176,"",,

rayyan-224211374,Predicting river water quality under different environmental factors and its significance with Machine Learning approach,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"River Water Quality (RWQ) is significantly influenced by natural and anthropogenic activities such as land use and land cover changes. Urbanization has led to an increase in impervious surfaces, which alters hydrological flow pattern and delivers non-point pollutants to the stream more efficiently. In addition, intensification of agricultural activities can result in the increased nutrient loads due to alternations in surface soil properties. Hence, it is necessary to understand the impact of surrounding environment with specific emphasis on geographical factors (e.g. climate change, land use patterns and landscape metrics) on the RWQ in order to develop sustainable water quality management strategies effectively. We collected pollutant concentration Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD), Total Phosphorus (T-P), and&amp;#160; Total Organic Carbon(TOC) from monitoring stations in the Nakdong River watershed.

rayyan-224211375,Effects of Long-Term Wetland Variations on Flood Risks in the Yangtze River Basin&amp;#160;,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"In the Yangtze River Basin (YRB), flooding is the most frequent natural disaster with enormous socio-economic damages. As a critical component in the hydrological cycle, the wetlands along the YRB have been changing during recent decades because of urbanization, intensive farming (e.g., aquaculture and agriculture) and climate change. Due to the lack of a long-term wetland classification dataset with comprehensive wetland categories, however, there&amp;#8217;s a noticeable gap in the YRB water management regarding the relative roles of different wetland categories on flood resilience. Therefore, this study aimed to generate a long-term wetland classification dataset for the YRB and further investigate the long-term wetland variations on the YRB flood risk assessments for the period from 1985 to 2021. The dataset named Long-Term Wetland Classification Dataset for YRB (LTWCD_YRB) was created using a Random Forest machine learning classifier on Google Earth Engine with 30m resolution Landsat 5, 7, 8 muti-spectral images. The maps of LTWCD_YRB demonstrated the spatial distribution, annual variability, and seasonal cycle of nine wetland categories in the extent, and the total validation accuracy can reach 85%. The LTWCD_YRB indicated that the total wetland area of the YRB in 2021 was larger than that in 1985, with constantly increased human-made wetlands and fluctuated natural wetlands. Aquaculture ponds expanded the most (4,987 km2);&amp;#160;inland marsh in the source region was the wetland category with the most fluctuations. Seasonal changes in wetlands were prominent in the Poyang Lake Basin, Dongting Lake Basin, and YRB source region. The LTWCD_YRB&amp;#160;can offer a consistent agreement of wetland area variations with the other satellite-based wetland datasets in the YRB, which is&amp;#160;valuable for researchers&amp;#160;and stakeholders to better understand the YRB wetlands and would support sustainable wetland management practices.&amp;#160;With the&amp;#160;LTWCD_YRB data as modelling inputs, a GIS-based spatial multi-index&amp;#160;flooding risk assessment model was applied for investigating&amp;#160;the long-term implications of wetland variations on flood risks in the YRB. The model results indicate that in the year with large floods and extremely high precipitation, flood risk level increased obviously after adding the wetland factor. For the years with normal precipitation, flood risk level decreased with wetlands expansion and increased with wetlands shrinkage in the YRB. The long-term expansion of aquaculture ponds contributed to a lower flood risk in the Taihu Lake Basin. In contrast, the Poyang Lake Basin experienced an increasing flood risk due to the long-term shrinkage in lake areas resulting from soil erosion and urbanization along the lakeside.

rayyan-224211411,Drought dynamics in mixed climate regions: insights for water resource management and climate adaptation strategies,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"<title>Abstract</title> Global warming and climate change are causing temperatures to rise, which is having a negative impact on water resources. Climate change is a worldwide problem that affects and will continue to affect the frequency and intensity of natural disasters in many regions of the world. Tunceli region in Turkey, which until ten years ago was known as an environmentally friendly city with abundant water resources and frequent rainfall, is experiencing a decrease in precipitation during the snowy winter season. This situation has made the investigation of climate change impacts an important issue in the region. Therefore, effective climate change adaptation strategies need to be developed. To determine these strategies, in this study, we assessed drought conditions using drought indices such as Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), Reconnaissance Drought Index (RDI), Normal Precipitation Index (PNI), and Aridity Index (AI). The SPI and RDI analyses were performed in annual reference periods on a time scale of 3, 6, 9, and 12 months using temperature, precipitation, and evaporation data. Consequently, the SPI and RDI results were compared, and both indices show similar behavior in dry, wet, and normal seasons. Nevertheless, RDI shows less variation between different time scales, which is an advantage over SPI and is probably due to the inclusion of potential evapotranspiration in RDI. The variations in PNI between humid and dry sub-humid categorizations throughout the years, combined with the AI results, indicate that the Tunceli region predominantly experiences a climate ranging from dry sub-humid to semi-arid. This study could help decision-makers take effective measures to become more resilient to climate change in temperate climate regions and take important steps toward sustainable water resources management.","",https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-4518030/v1,"",,

The situation becomes more critical when these hydrologic extremes combine with land use change mainly caused by anthropogenic factors, such as urbanization, intensive farming, and industrial activities. The present study is designed to investigate the combined impacts of climate and land use changes on the future freshwater &amp;#160;stored in the artificial reservoirs of three adjacent river basins located in the central Sicily (Italy), i.e: Verdura (2 active reservoirs with capacities 9.2 Mmc and 4.19 Mmc), Imera Meridionale (one active reservoir with capacity 15 Mmc), and Platani (one active reservoir with capacity 20.7Mmc), using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model. The reservoirs are used for irrigation, drinking water supply, and electric power generation. Future climate variables such as rainfall, minimum and maximum temperatures were derived from an ensemble Regional Climate Models for two main representative concentration pathway (RCP) scenarios, such as an intermediate emission scenario (RCP4.5) and a severe emission scenario (RCP8.5). A coupled multi-layer perceptron neural networks and cellular automata (MLP-CA) model was implemented to simulate future land use of the region considering the CORINE land cover in 2000, 2006, 2012, and 2018 as a reference dataset. The future land use is then projected until the mid-century (2048) in a six-year interval using the validated MLP-CA model. The soil data from the European soil data center (EUSDAC) was used as input for the SWAT model. The result indicated that the basins could experience a decrease in inflows to the reservoirs. The separate evaluation of climate change and land use changes indicated that the effect of climate change on streamflow variation is more pronounced than the effect of land use change only. In this study, we introduced new hydrological insights into the region by analyzing the attributions of climate change, land use change, and coupled climate and land use changes on the future freshwater availability which were overlooked in the previous studies. The implementation of the proposed approach can contribute to design environmentally sustainable and climate resilient river basin management strategies. &amp;#160; Keywords: MLP-CA, Land use change, Climate change, SWAT, Hydrological modeling, Water availability","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu24-4462,"",,

Systems modeling can replicate the interactions but extensive parameterization, high complexity, and long development cycles present barriers to widespread adoption. To address these challenges, we develop the Machine Learning Water Systems Model (ML-WSM) – a novel application of data-driven modeling for MWS management. We apply the ML-WSM framework to the Salt Lake City, Utah water system, where we benchmark prediction performance on the seasonal response of reservoir levels, groundwater withdrawal, and imported water requests to climate anomalies at a daily resolution against an existing systems model. The ML-WSM accurately predicts the seasonal dynamics of all components; especially during supply-limiting conditions (KGE &amp;gt; 0.88, PBias &amp;lt; ±3%). Extreme wet conditions challenged model skill but the ML-WSM communicated the appropriate seasonal trends and relationships to component thresholds (e.g., reservoir dead pool). The model correctly classified nearly all instances of vulnerability (83%) and peak severity (100%), encouraging its use as a guidance tool that complements systems models for evaluating the influences of climate on MWS performance.","",https://doi.org/10.2166/hydro.2023.170,"",,
rayyan-224211467,Hybrid Drought Forecasting Framework for Water‐Scarce Regions Based on Support Vector Machine and Precipitation Index,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"ABSTRACT Drought is a natural event that slowly deteriorates water reserves. This study aims to develop a machine learning–based computational framework for monitoring drought status in water‐scarce regions. The proposed framework integrates the precipitation index (PI) with support vector machine models to forecast drought occurrences based on an autoregressive modelling scheme. Due to the suitability of the PI for drought analysis in arid climates, the developed hybrid model is appropriate in regions with limited rainfall. This study used a historical precipitation dataset from 1958 to 2020 at the Kuwait International Airport, Kuwait City. The study area is characterised by scarce rainfall and is vulnerable to severe water shortages owing to limited water resources. Initially, historical PI time‐series datasets were examined for stationarity to validate the utility of the autoregressive model. The autocorrelation function test was significantly associated with the PI time series at the 12‐ and 24‐month drought‐monitoring scales. Predictive drought forecasting models were constructed to predict drought occurrences up to 3 months in advance. Statistical evaluation metrics were used to assess model performance for the 12‐ and 24‐month drought‐monitoring scales. The results showed a strong association between the observed and predicted drought events, with coefficients of determination ( R 2 ) ranging between 0.865 and 0.925 for the 12‐ and 24‐month drought‐monitoring scales. The proposed computational framework aims to provide water managers in arid and water‐scarce regions with efficient and reliable drought‐monitoring tools to assist in preparing appropriate water management plans. This study provides guidance for improving water resource resilience under water shortage scenarios in the study area and other climatic regions by applying suitable drought indices in conjunction with robust data‐driven models. The results provide a baseline for water resource policymakers worldwide to establish sustainable water conservation strategies and provide crucial insights for drought disaster preparation.","",https://doi.org/10.1002/hyp.70031,"",,
rayyan-224211476,Assessing Future hydrological response of an urban watershed using machine learning based LULC forecasting models,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Urbanization in terms of land-use/cover (LULC) change has a long-term significant impact on the hydrological cycle as the LULC is one of the most important influencing parameters to produce curve number (CN). The drastic change in LULC changes the CN. This change directly affects surface water including peak flows. This study aims to assess the change in surface runoff due to changes in LULC. Hydrological modeling is done for the consistent long-term behavioral study of surface runoff. The area focused on the study is the Kharun river, a tributary of the Mahanadi River. For the assessment of the impact of LULC change on the catchment discharge, a daily-step conceptual model soil and water assessment tool (SWAT) was applied. Landuse maps were prepared with the Landsat Thematic Mapper satellite images. The future land use was forecasted with the technique of spatial statistical modeling. The machine learning (ML) tool is used for quantifying the influences on the LULC change dynamics and producing the LULC map for 2024 and 2030. Remote sensing (RS) and geographic information system (GIS) analysis were coupled with hydrological SWAT modeling to investigate the connection between the LULC change and hydrologic regime. The SWAT Model’s calibration efficiency is verified by comparing the simulated and observed discharge time series at the Patharidih gauge and discharge station. The monthly and daily calibrations were quite satisfactory, with Nash-Sutcliffe an efficiency coefficient of 0.86 and 0.67. This modeling provides reliable information for sustainable management of available water resources of the catchment.","",https://doi.org/10.25303/1711da035048,"",,
rayyan-224211482,Monitoring Coastline Dynamics Using Satellite Remote Sensing and Geographic Information Systems: A Review of Global Trends,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Nearly half of the world's population lives near the coasts of oceans and seas. The coastline position changes under the influence of multiple natural and anthropogenic factors. Recently, due to the global impacts of climate change and population growth, the issue of geomorphological changes in coastlines has become more critical. Therefore, the assessment and mapping of coastline dynamics is one of the most essential factors for sustainable development goals and urban planning. The objectives of this study are to focus on discussing the research progress of applications of satellite remote sensing datasets and GIS methods for coastline extraction, mapping, and analysis along global coasts. A systematic review and trend analysis of the most recent published studies that focused on remote sensing and GIS techniques for assessing coastal dynamics were published between 2012 and 2022 along different coasts worldwide. The results indicated that multisource and multisensor remote sensing datasets were globally utilized for monitoring coastline changes, including (1) medium-resolution imagery such as Sentinel and Landsat, (2) SAR and optical high-resolution imagery, (3) modern remote sensing technologies such as UAV and LiDAR, and (4) GIS-based methods, spatial analysis, and artificial intelligence. This study concludes that coastal change can be tracked using any form of remote sensing, including drones, LiDAR, higher resolution imaging, and Landsat imagery. This review provides a comprehensive reference for upcoming work on coastal management and exploitation development and research, especially for the low elevation coastal zones that are affected by coastal hazards.","",https://doi.org/10.21608/cat.2024.233931.1196,"",,

The increasing trend in aquaponics research demonstrates a growing recognition of its potential to address critical global issues such as food security, water conservation, and sustainable agriculture, particularly in regions vulnerable to climate change and resource limitations. It has witnessed remarkable advancements in recent years, with various methods and variations emerging to enhance its functionality and productivity. The purpose of this review is to unify fragmented research on aquaponics and provide a comprehensive resource that emphasizes its potential for broad adoption and successful implementation in varied environments. This review focuses on recent innovations in aquaponic system designs for various climates and examines key advancements in critical areas, including microbial communities, biofiltration, feed management, water quality, and nutrient cycling, emphasizing the interdisciplinary nature of aquaponics. Coupled systems suit moderate climates with high resource efficiency, while decoupled systems offer flexibility across diverse climates by allowing independent control of each component. Innovations such as sandponics, algaeponics, and saline aquaponics address challenges like water scarcity and nutrient efficiency. Smart technologies like IoT and AI are integrated into aquaponics, automating monitoring and nutrient management for better productivity. Emerging areas, including vermi‐aquaponics and flocponics, offer new solutions for nutrient cycling, making aquaponics more efficient, adaptable, and resource‐conserving globally. This paper also examines the sustainability aspects of aquaponics, emphasizing its economic, social, and environmental dimensions. Despite high setup costs and nutrient complexities, aquaponics offers significant potential for sustainable food production by minimizing water use and reducing synthetic fertilizers. Its scalability in both urban and rural areas, along with innovations like vertical systems, presents promising solutions for enhancing agriculture and food security across diverse environments.","",https://doi.org/10.1111/jwas.13116,"",,
rayyan-224211558,"Ecology of Lake Erie - Nutrients, microbes, algae, and dreissenid mussels: A synthesis",,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"The Lake Erie ecosystem, including its physical, chemical, and biological components, has changed considerably during recent decades owing to human-induced environmental stress (Fraker et al., 2022; Makarewicz and Bertram, 1991; Munawar and Munawar, 1976; Sinclair et al., 2021). While much has been learned from monitoring and research activities, a full understanding of how and why the ecosystem has changed is lacking (Fraker et al., 2023; Fussell et al., 2016; Sterner et al., 2017; Scavia et al., 2023), which has hampered the development of management strategies that can help sustain the integrity of the lake and its valued ecosystem services (e.g. clean water, safe recreation, food production). This AEHM special issue is the first of four focused on Lake Erie, all of which will aim to display the science being conducted to enhance ecosystem understanding and guide management decision-making.This special issue centers on watershed, nutrient, microbial (including cyanobacteria), algal, and dreissenid mussel dynamics, including their causes and consequences. Specifically, it focuses on understanding factors that have driven changes in: 1) nutrient loading and in-lake nutrient dynamics; 2) algal and cyanobacteria dynamics; and 3) dreissenid growth, impacts, and spatial variation. After recapping each paper's major messages and management implications, we offer some concluding remarks.Since the early 2000s, Lake Erie has shown signs of intensified eutrophication, including increases in the extent and duration of hypoxia and harmful algal blooms dominated by cyanobacteria (hereafter, cyanoHABs; Scavia et al., 2014; Watson et al., 2016). Some of those symptoms have been linked to altered nutrient dynamics in Lake Erie's watersheds and, particularly, significant increases in dissolved reactive phosphorus loads (Baker et al., 2014; Stumpf et al., 2016). The source of most phosphorus entering Lake Erie is agriculture (Wilson et al., 2018); however, this source is dispersed across the landscape (Kast et al., 2021) and difficult to mitigate. Thus, delineating the characteristics of watersheds that export the largest amount of nutrients is important to identifying locations where nutrient reduction will be most effective. While reducing nutrient input is critical, the behavior of nutrients once they have entered the lake is likely to influence where and when cyanoHABs occur. Toward improving our understanding of eutrophication, two of this AEHM special issue's contributors focused on identifying causes of variation in the dynamics of nutrient loading and approaches to model the availability of these loads on chemicophysical conditions.Johnson et al. (2023) sought to identify how watershed characteristics have influenced nutrient and sediment inputs into western Lake Erie. To this end, these authors used a suite of physical attributes, land uses, and point-source contributions to characterize seven tributary watersheds, six of which are Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement Annex 4 priority watersheds, and five sub-watersheds. The authors then used principal components regression analysis to determine their relationship with nutrient and sediment yields into Lake Erie. Briefly, their results demonstrated spatial (regional) variation in contributions of nutrients and sediments from each river during 2017-2021 that was related to watershed attributes. For example, nutrient inputs into Lake Erie from watersheds were positively related to the percentage of land supporting cultivated crops and poorly drained soils, with higher slopes and lower amounts of pasture being positively correlated with sediment yields. These authors then discussed their findings in the context of impending nutrient reductions aimed at mitigation of Lake Erie's recent re-eutrophication (Baker et al., 2019), explaining how consideration of regional differences in nutrient and sediment yields could benefit nutrient management planning.While Johnson et al. centered on factors that influence nutrient and sediment loading into Lake Erie, Bocaniov et al. (2023) focused how nutrient (total phosphorus, TP) inputs affect within-lake TP movement and distribution. These authors used an updated phosphorus mass-balance model (2003-2016) to derive TP load-response relationships and response matrices to predict steady-state lake TP concentrations as a function of variable external TP inputs. A key finding is that inter-basin transfer of TP plays a large role in driving basin-specific TP concentrations (e.g. inflow from the central basin contributes ∼70% of the resident TP in the eastern basin). Bocaniov et al.'s modeling also demonstrated that western Lake Erie is likely to respond quickly (93 days) to reduced TP inputs, with longer response times estimated in the central and eastern basins (540 and 303 days, respectively). These authors then discuss how their findings can help guide where in the watershed to manage nutrients and what timeframes may be needed before agencies can expect to see impacts of nutrient abatement efforts.An outcome of excessive agricultural nutrient loading into aquatic ecosystems is enhanced primary production. Lake Erie has experienced increases in benthic algae (e.g. Cladophora), pelagic algae, and cyanobacteria during both past (1960s-1970s) and more recent eutrophication events (Munawar and Munawar, 1996; O'Donnell et al., 2023; Vollenweider et al., 1974; Watson et al., 2016). Lake Erie is a large and complex ecosystem, however, and the specific type or location of algal blooms cannot be predicted by nutrient loading alone. Rather, how and where blooms form will depend on complex processes such as gazing pressure and nutrient availability within the lake, as well as water warming that will interact with high nutrient availability. With this backdrop, four papers in this AEHM special issue sought to enhance our ability to understand and describe the dynamics of primary producers, including algae and cyanobacteria.To help better understand the mechanisms responsible for benthic Cladophora outbreaks in eastern Lake Erie since dreissenid mussels colonized the lake, Depew et al. (2023) quantified the enzymatically hydrolysable portion (EHP) of dissolved organic phosphorus (DOP). Samples were collected during May through September 2019 at varying depths along the north shore of the eastern basin. These authors found that the EHP substantially contributed to the dissolved P pool, with this contribution averaging 53% of the total dissolved P and 63% of the DOP concentration. Hence, a large amount of DOP appears bioavailable owing to enzymatic hydrolysis. This result, combined with the fact that bioavailable DOP concentrations often exceeded dissolved reactive P concentrations, indicates an increased role of the benthic contributions to P bioavailability in the eastern basin since the establishment of dreissenid mussels. In turn, Depew et al. highlight the need to consider EHP when designing management strategies to control Cladophora outbreaks in the eastern basin.In contrast to Depew et al., Hoffman et al. (2023) quantified seasonal nitrification in Lake Erie's water column and explored its potential role in driving microbial dynamics, including cyanoHABs dominated by Microcystis spp. To do so, these authors used the stable isotope, 15NH4+, to track nitrification and qPCR to determine the relative abundances of ammonia oxidizing organisms (i.e. bacteria and Archaea, AOO) during 2015-2017. Hoffman et al. found that nitrification rates were lower during cyanoHABs, suggesting that AOOs were not good competitors with cyanobacteria for ammonia. These low rates can in part explain why cyanoHABs dominated by Microcystis spp. (non-nitrogen fixers) can persist despite low bioavailable nitrogen (N). Further, the removal of bioavailable N via coupled nitrification-denitrification is lower than the increase in bioavailable N through regeneration and external N loading. Using these findings, Hoffman et al. discuss the importance of reducing N loading into Lake Erie as a means to help reduce seasonal cyanoHABs.Hounshell et al. (2023) also focused on understanding cyanoHAB dynamics, exploring the role of P as a driver instead of N. While total bioavailable P (TBP) loading from the Maumee River (Ohio, USA) during spring has been shown to be a strong predictor of cyanoHAB severity in western Lake Erie (Baker et al., 2014; Bertani et al., 2016; Stumpf et al., 2016), much unexplained variation in cyanoHAB severity remains. Thus, Hounshell et al. (2023) sought to identify environmental variables that could improve the predictive relationship between the Maumee River spring TBP load and cyanoHAB severity. Their modeling showed that at both low (< 273 MTA) and high (> 332 MTA) TBP loads levels, no other environmental factors improved predictive accuracy of cyanoHABs in western Lake Erie. However, during years with intermediate springtime TBP loads (273-332 MTA), predictions of cyanoHABs could be improved by considering winter and July TBP loads, as well as ice extent and phenology. While their work is still ongoing, Hounshell et al.'s research highlights the value of both tributary and in-lake monitoring, as well as process-based modeling to cyanoHAB forecasting.Wang et al. (2023) also sought to use modeling to predict the distribution of cyanoHABs in Lake Erie. Specifically, these authors compared the performance of the one-dimensional (1D) Aquatic Ecosystem Dynamics–General Lake Model (AED–GLM) and the three-dimensional (3D) Aquatic Ecosystem Model (AEM3D–iWQ) in predicting cyanoHABs, phytoplankton biomass (as measured by chlorophyll a), and associated physicochemical conditions (e.g. water temperature, nutrients), among other things, in western Lake Erie during 2008 and 2011-2014. By qualitatively comparing their results to in situ observations, Wang et al. showed that the 3D model better reproduced seasonal and spatial variation in nutrients and phytoplankton with less error than the 1D model. Conversely, cyanoHABs were better predicted by the 1D model. As detailed in their paper, Wang et al. explain how the scale at which these models are calibrated can drive differences in model performance. These authors also discuss the implications of their findings for choosing the appropriate model to support management endeavors, including how to best calibrate them to achieve desired goals.The final set of papers centered on invasive dreissenid mussels, which have become a ubiquitous part of the Great Lakes since their introduction nearly four decades ago (Nalepa et al., 2005). Owing to their potential to negatively impact native mussels (Schloesser et al., 2006), zooplankton communities (Johannsson et al., 2000), phytoplankton biomass (Bocaniov et al., 2014), and nutrient cycling (Hecky et al., 2004), Zebra (Dreissena polymorpha) and Quagga (D. rostiformis bugensis) Mussels have garnered the interest of researchers and management agencies alike. Much of this effort has been devoted to understanding the mechanisms that influence dreissenid demographics and impacts of the food web, which are the focus of the last set of papers in this AEHM special issue.To understand the growth dynamics of dreissenid mussels and their impact on phytoplankton in western Lake Erie, Carter et al. (2023) combined field surveys, in situ growth experiments, and laboratory excretion and grazing experiments. Their results, which are important in interpreting two of the remaining AEHM special issue papers, showed that dreissenid communities have lower clearance rates and excretion rates compared to previously reported rates. This understanding, combined with reduced dreissenid densities in Lake Erie during recent decades, led Carter et al. to conclude that the ability of dreissenids to compound the effect of eutrophication that causes cyanoHABs may be less than previously thought (e.g. Vanderploeg et al., 2009; but see Carrick et al., 2023 and Vanderploeg et al., 2023). Carter et al. (2023) acknowledge, however, that the impact of dreissenids could be locally high at times, owing to their patchy distribution across the basin. In turn, these authors stress the need for frequent, fine-scale benthic surveys, which could improve ability to understand and forecast the impacts of dreissenids on the ecosystem.Carrick et al. (2023) also sought to quantify the impact of dreissenid mussels on plankton assemblages (heterotrophs and phototrophs) in western Lake Erie. Using controlled experiments conducted monthly during May through October 2018, these authors show that dreissenids graze actively throughout the growing season, consuming nano-sized heterotrophic and phototrophic plankton (e.g. phototrophic cryptophytes, centric diatoms, and non-pigmented chrysomonads). By contrast, lower clearance rates of cyanobacteria (e.g. Microcystis spp.), dinoflagellates, and some colonial chlorophytes were observed. Carrick et al. further suggest that selective dreissenid grazing on ""non-harmful"" plankton species in the nanoplankton size range, combined with lower grazing rates on larger cyanobacteria and chlorophyte species, could contribute to western Lake Erie's cyanoHAB problem. Notably, the small-scale experimental results of Carrick et al. contrast those from Carter et al.'s (2023) field-based study. This discrepancy highlights the value of both experimental and field-based approaches, as well as the need to carefully consider the spatiotemporal context of the investigation, when to quantifying the role of dreissenid grazing as a secondary promoter (above nutrient loading) of cyanoHABs.Vanderploeg et al. (2023) also used an experimental approach to quantity the impacts of dreissenid mussel grazing on the phytoplankton community. Their experiments showed that grazing pressure on phytoplankton varied during May through October, with grazing on cryptophytes and diatoms being high during late May through early July. Despite cyanophytes dominating the phytoplankton beginning in late July, dreissenid grazing on them was non-existent or low. Interestingly, 16S rRNA gene-sequencing analyses showed a diverse cyanobacteria community with Planktothrix dominating during the spring and Cyanobium dominating most of the summer through fall. By contrast, Microcystis, which is largely thought to dominate cyanoHABs in Lake Erie, only dominated during late June. Further, Microcystis was preferentially rejected by Quagga Mussels relative to other cyanobacteria. Using these findings, Vanderploeg et al. draw a similar conclusion as Carrick et al. (2023) by suggesting that dreissenid grazing can favor specific cyanobacteria such as Microcystis. Importantly, however, the final effect of dreissenid grazing as a secondary promoter of cyanoHABS depends on the population density of dreissenids, which is currently low (Carter et al., 2023).In this special issue's final paper, Elgin et al. (2023) conducted an in situ study to quantify spatial variation in colonization potential, growth rates, and abundance of dreissenid mussels at two sites with contrasting water-column conditions in western Lake Erie. Despite finding comparable dreissenid colonization potential and growth between study sites, both on and in the experimental cages, Elgin et al. found fewer mussels in the surrounding sediment at the site nearer the Maumee River. These authors use this finding to conclude that water-column conditions appear to favor dreissenid settlement and growth on hard surfaces suspended above the substrate across the western basin, but that conditions on or near the substrate may inhibit mussel settling and growth. Elgin et al. eventually discuss how substrate-driven bottlenecks could inform our understanding of dreissenid recruitment and distribution, as well as nutrient dynamics, in western Lake Erie. These authors also suggest how better characterization of substrate conditions could support dreissenid control efforts.Owing to the impact of humans, the world's ecosystems have been experiencing dramatic change, which has threatened their structure, function, and dynamics, as well as their capacity to support services valued by society. The world's Great Lakes are no exception with these ecosystems being degraded by numerous anthropogenic stressors, including nutrient alteration (both eutrophication and oligotrophication), non-native species invasions, habitat destruction, and climate change, among many others (Allan et al., 2013; Jenny, 2020; Odada et al., 2003). The magnitude, multitude, and simultaneous nature of these stressors have in turn challenged both researchers seeking to understand the dynamics of these ecosystems and agencies charged with managing the valued natural resources (e.g. fish, wildlife) and other services (e.g. safe drinking water, recreational opportunities) that these ecosystems provide (Allan et al., 2013; Odada and Olago, 2006; Sterner et al., 2017). Such challenges highlight the need for continued research aimed at understanding the causes and consequences of anthropogenic change.While all the large lakes of the world have been altered by anthropogenic stress, Lake Erie is among the most degraded. Its susceptibility to anthropogenic stress is largely due to its small size, shallow depth, high connectivity via shipping, and large watershed that supports both large cities and agricultural production (Fraker et al, 2022; Ludsin et al., 2001; Reutter, 2019). Most relevant to this AEHM special issue, Lake Erie has shifted trophic states multiple times in response to human impacts and subsequent mitigation efforts. Prior to the 1950s, Lake Erie was primarily in a pre-industrial state of mesotrophy-oligotrophy and shifted to a state of hypertrophy-mesotrophy during the 1960s-1970s. During the 1980s-1990s, it shifted back to more mesotrophic conditions in response to both mitigation efforts designed to reduce point-source inputs of TP and the invasion of dreissenid mussels. Most recently (post 2000), Lake Erie returned to a more eutrophic state due to non-point source runoff of dissolved reactive phosphorus (Kane et al., 2014; Ludsin et al., 2001; Sinclair et al., 2023; Vollenweider et al., 1974). Concomitantly, Lake Erie has currently been experiencing increases in the magnitude and extent of both bottom hypoxia and cyanoHABs (Scavia et al., 2014; Watson et al., 2016), which are threatening: human health through cyanotoxin exposure (e.g. Francy et al., 2016; Wituszynski et al., 2017); fish populations and the fisheries that they support (e.g. Stone et al., 2020; Wolf et al., 2017); and the regional economy through effects on tourism and property values (Smith et al., 2019; Wolf et al., 2022). These threats have increased the need for the science necessary to make informed management decisions (Fraker et al., 2023; Fussell et al., 2016; Sterner et al., 2017; Scavia et al., 2023), which includes describing the current state of the Lake Erie ecosystem and understanding the causal mechanisms of recent ecosystem change.The contributions to this AEHM special issue have provided new insights into the drivers of nutrient inputs, in-lake nutrient concentrations, benthic algae (Cladophora), planktonic heterotrophs, microbial autotrophs (including cyanobacteria responsible for cyanoHABs), algae (e.g. diatoms, cryptophytes), and dreissenid mussels. Further, each study has provided information that could benefit management, whether it be ecological understanding that could support ecosystem modeling (e.g. quantifying dreissenid distributions and their impacts on grazing rates and nutrient excretion; Carter et al., 2023; Elgin et al., 2023) or tools that could support nutrient management decision-making (e.g. Bocaniov et al., 2023; Johnson et al, 2023), cyanoHAB severity (e.g. Carrick et al.,. 2023; Hounshell et al., 2023; Vanderploeg et al., 2023) or chemicophysical conditions, including algal and cyanobacteria biomass (e.g. Depew et al., 2023; Hoffman et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023). While many additional messages can be found in the papers, collectively, three key conclusions can be made. First, findings from each of the three focal areas of this AEHM special issue highlight the need to consider fine spatial and/or temporal scales in both the watershed and the lake proper. Doing so offers a means to fully appreciate the complex array of processes driving the dynamics of Lake Erie's chemicophysical conditions and lower food web (e.g. primary producers, dreissenid mussels). Second, while the papers in this special issue showed the value of field-, laboratory-, and modeling-based research to describing, understanding, or predicting ecosystem conditions, they also pointed to challenges that can arise when integrating findings. For example, discrepancies can arise owing to studies being conducted in different settings (e.g. in the laboratory vs. in the field) or at different spatiotemporal scales (e.g. see Carrick et al., 2023; Carter et al., 2023; Vanderploeg et al., 2023). Finally, most papers demonstrated the need for continued and intensified monitoring (e.g. broader coverage at finer spatial and temporal scales), which will challenge agencies responsible for tracking ecosystem conditions. We expect, however, that continued improvement in our ability to cost-effectively monitor Lake Erie and its watershed via remote sensing technologies (Yang et al., 2022; Yin et al., 2021), combined with continually improving data-analytic approaches (e.g. machine and deep learning; Sun and Scanlon, 2019), will help agencies meet this challenge.While the research described in this AEHM special issue has addressed many knowledge gaps, many more remain. Our hope is that continued reporting of findings as part of this AEHM Ecology of Lake Erie series will increase our ability to understand and model the structure, function, and dynamics of the ecosystem. Such understanding and tools should facilitate our continued movement towards ecosystem-based management in the Great Lakes, which could help agencies rehabilitate the lake and sustainably manage its valued resources in the face of continued anthropogenic stress.We thank Ken Minns for providing helpful feedback on a previous version of this synthesis.","",https://doi.org/10.14321/aehm.026.04.131,"",,
rayyan-224211613,2023: A year of success in the climate change battle or a missed opportunity?,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"From 30 November to 12 December 2023, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) 28th Conference of the Parties (COP28) was held in the United Arab Emirates. This World Climate Action Summit brought together 154 Heads of State and Government. In the very final stage of the Summit, the Parties reached several important agreements including operationalization of the loss and damage fund reinforcing the role of children and youth as agents of change through the Presidency youth climate champion, to operationalizing the transition from the fossil fuel use, emissions cuts, and scaled-up financing arrangements (United Nations COP 28, 2024). According to many observers and commentators, the agreements, which aim at more decisive climate action before the end of the decade to keep the global temperature limit of 1.5°C, imply recognition that global greenhouse gas emissions need to be cut 43% by 2030, compared to 2019 levels, to achieve that goal. This includes accelerating efforts towards the phase-down of unabated coal power, phasing out inefficient fossil fuel subsidies, and other measures that drive the transition away from fossil fuels in energy systems. The direction towards more equitable development, with developed countries continuing to take the lead, is suggested as the path to achieving those ambitious goals, and if possible, closer to 2025 (1 year from now!). Other researchers note that the urgent phasing out of fossil fuels is necessary but not sufficient. Mazzucato et al. (2023) consider that even if we could decarbonize the economy tomorrow, we would still not have a sustainable future until we take steps to maintain water systems and natural habitats. The authors argue that there is scientific evidence that ""nature loss on its own can send us crashing through the Paris climate agreement's target of limiting global warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels, ushering in a world where millions of people in vulnerable environments would no longer be able to adapt"". Further, ""(t)he increasingly well-documented links between climate change, biodiversity loss, and water insecurity point to a fundamental issue: our economic systems are based on flawed thinking. We are forever reacting to market failures when we should be pursuing proactive strategies to shape the economy for the common good"" (Ibid). We have called attention to the major connections of water with the sustainable development process and goals, from our very first Editorial in 2014 (Neto & Camkin, 2014) to the central role of water in adapting to climate change in 2023 (Camkin & Neto, 2023). Safeguarding water resources and biodiversity cannot be done without decarbonization. The unbalanced way water and its resources have been used everywhere, within a frame of uncontrolled exhaustion of the environment and the services it provides, has undoubtedly contributed to the intensification of climatic extremes. 2023 was the hottest year on record (EC, 2023), with critical rising temperatures, serious fires in many countries, and floods in many regions. In 2023, we saw how all these extremes are having an increasing impact on already vulnerable populations, and communities, making more people homeless and increasing the number of climate refugees. Amongst the gloom, there is lots of positive action. In Europe, for example, the European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS) were enforced from 1st January 2024, obligating all companies to report water risks across their operations and value chains. This mandatory reporting on water aims to help companies understand (1) the material risks and opportunities arising from their dependence on water; (2) the impacts a company's activities may have on water resources; and (3) the actions a company is taking to prevent negative impacts and contribute to broader EU water objectives (ESRS, 2023). Of course, no single action is enough to match the huge and intrinsically interconnected challenges; water-related issues can no longer be ignored in any context. The challenge is not small, or dispensable. The water cycle, its territorial links, the environment, economic uses and resources, governance—in a word—require competence and strategic vision. Both are not abundant, unfortunately, which demands multiplied efforts from the real agents for change. Given the scale of climate changes and their effects, the latest COP 28 can bring some light to the path. But it is not an entirely optimistic outlook when we look at what is effectively happening. Actors around the world cry for clearer actions for decarbonization, but sadly, many of the fossil fuel-based activities continue to be supported and strongly financed in many regions, despite the Paris Agreement and the final decisions of the Conference of the Parties in Dubai at the end of last year. As pointed out by several agencies, many countries ""are still aiming at peaking their fossil fuel use in the next years, … and countries that have ratified and agreed upon the European Union targets and the new EU Directives, still subsidize fossil fuels"" (Oikonomou, 2023). For example, in Greece, three environmental organizations have filed a formal complaint to the European Commission against Greece for systematically giving a free pass to oil and gas drilling off the Greek coasts, in breach of EU and national laws. Because COP28 was so important, we have invited Sarah Ransom, General Manager of the Australian Water Partnership, to write a Guest Editorial for this issue, entitled Returning from Dubai: Reflections on Water in the Climate Conference. Sarah provides many relevant insights into the realities of COP28, building upon her experience of also attending previous COPs. Sarah concludes that ""there is an opportunity ahead for the water community to make a significant contribution both to the fight for 1.5°C, and to ensure our skills and knowledge help communities and ecosystems to build resilience and adapt where needed, following the UN call for the water professionals to play a part on climate action in this critical decade."" The next 18 papers deal with a wide range of water issues, all linked to the need to improve the connection between research, policy, practice, and learning, particularly in the rapidly changing global context. In the paper, Is the Media Missing the Point on the Transnational American Desalination Pipe Dream? Brian F. O'Neill uses the example of large-scale seawater desalination in the southwest USA and Mexico to explore the role that media plays in the dissemination of information about globally significant transboundary issues like water policy and infrastructure projects. Drawing on experiences from Kazakhstan and elsewhere, Nurlan Apakhayev and co-authors report on their investigation into criminal offenses relating to water bodies and propose the development of new strategies and programs aimed at countering such crimes in Problems of Prevention of Criminal Offenses Related to the Use of Water Resources. Water quality management features strongly in this issue of WWP. Taking into consideration both the environmental limits specified by Egyptian legislation and industry-specific parameters, Doaa Abdou and Eid El—Ragehy propose an Industrial Water Quality Index in Unlocking Solutions for Cleaner Waters: The Industrial Wastewater Quality Index (IWQI) in Egypt and Beyond. In a book review Exploring Groundwater-Climate Change Interactions: A Critical Review of Groundwater and Climate Change: Multi-Level Law and Policy Perspectives by Philippe Cullet, Kulsum Fatima examines the key arguments presented, critically analyzing the book's contribution to the field of environmental law and policy, particularly relating to the interactions between climate change and groundwater. Returning to North America, Holly Wilts, David Burton and Aitazaz Farooque discuss the efficacy of various riparian buffer zone configurations and identify optimal buffers to protect surface water from contamination in A Comparison of Riparian Buffer Designs Incorporating Short-rotation Salix viminalis to Mitigate Surface Water Pollution in the Dunk River Watershed on Prince Edward Island. In Rainfall Extremes and Trends During the Little Dry Season in Nigeria, Joseph Omoniyi Adejuwon then presents an analysis of the ""little dry season"" in Nigeria—a dry spell amid the wet season—which is a phenomenon of interest in West Africa because of its impacts on agriculture and food production. Vishal Narain and Chanda Goodrich analyze the reasons for the limited impact of efforts for gender mainstreaming in the water sector in South Asia in their discussion paper, Glass Half Empty or Half Full? Gender in Integrated Water Resource Management in South Asia, noting that reserving seats for women in local patriarchal structures of decision-making does little to alter the status quo. Taking lessons from the experiences of riparian countries such as the Mekong River and common legal frameworks on international water law, Hoa Thanh Ha and Tuan Van Vu discuss the urgent need to establish a specialized international water management commission in their paper Urgent Call for Protection and Use of Transboundary Watercourses. Some Legal Reflections. Noting that rapid and frequent mapping of flood areas is crucial for monitoring and mitigating flood disasters, Sainath Reddy Poli and R. Bhavani's paper Assessment of Flood in Nandigama, Andhra Pradesh, Using Hydrological and Hydraulic Models reports on flood inundation mapping in Nandigama and its implications for the planning and management of flood control infrastructure. With soil erosion being a big challenge in Ethiopia due to the high expansion of agricultural activity and poor land-use management, Eyasu Tafese Mekuria's paper Sediment Yield Assessment and Suggesting Mitigation Measures: A Case Study of Deme Watershed, Omo-Gibe Basin, Ethiopia reports on sediment yield assessments and suggests mitigation measures that could reduce sediment yield by up to 90%. Amit Kumar Sharma and co-authors address the increasingly popular use of bio-indicators in water resource management in their article A Review on Plankton as a Bio-indicator: A Promising Tool for Monitoring Water Quality, highlighting recent research on the opportunities a range of planktons present for water quality management. Continuing with the water quality theme, the article Evaluating the Structures and Arrangements of Water Institutions to Include In-stream Modelling for Water Quality Management and Control Pollution: Insights from the Awash Basin, Ethiopia by Eskinder Zinabu and co-authors critically analyses existing models and the supporting environment, and suggest changes needed to improve institutional capacity. In their paper, Severity of Natural Calamities and Crop Yield Prediction Using Hybrid Deep Learning Model in Uttar Pradesh, Rajneesh Kumar and Rajendra Prasad Mahapatra discuss weaknesses in methods of predicting crop yields and propose approaches that better incorporate natural calamities such as drought, hail, and storm severity to support real-time agricultural practices and water quality protection. El Khoumsi Wafae and co-authors show that irrigation using treated wastewater generally promotes better growth in their article Effect of Treated Wastewater Irrigation on Ornamental Plants: Case Study of Lantana and Hibiscus, Morocco, highlighting the potential for a combination of treated wastewater and subsurface drip irrigation for irrigation of green spaces. Nepal has a high annual rainfall, but it still faces numerous challenges in ensuring good water quality. In the paper, An Analysis of Drinking Water Quality Parameters to Achieve Sustainable Development Goals in Rural and Urban Areas of Besisahar, Lamjung, Nepal, Mahendra Aryal reports on an analysis of 27 water samples taken from a variety of water sources with the results suggesting the need for great involvement of governments and developments in water resource management to ensure sustainability. Alebachew Shumye Moges and Sisay Assefa Wondimagegn then take us back to Ethiopia with their article, Evaluate the Effectiveness of Soil and Water Conservation Interventions in the Upper Awash Basin, Ethiopia, in which they survey community attitudes and assess the effectiveness of different conservation methods in enhancing soil physicochemical properties, reducing soil loss and erosion, and maximizing land productivity. In Assessing Groundwater Quality, Health Risks and Policy Implications: A Case Study of West Medinipur District, West Bengal, India, Md Anjar Alam, Damodhara Rao Mailapalli and Basant Maheshwari discuss the potential health risks, highlighting the complexity of groundwater quality and the need for comprehensive water policy and management strategies. Finally, Bitew K. Dessie and co-authors draw upon previous and current research to report on Pollution Challenges and Consequences of the Akaki Catchment, Upper Awash Basin, Ethiopia: Evidence for Policy Reform and Action. Finding that despite good laws and standards at federal and regional levels, environmental pollution is not being prevented because of ineffective implementation or enforcement, the authors recommend a set of specific and urgent policy measures. Thank you to all our authors and to the numerous reviewers who volunteered their time to support this issue of World Water Policy. We trust you will enjoy reading this rich collection of insights from around the world into water policy, practice, and the learning that supports them. We look forward to your contributions in the future. Our best wishes Susana Neto, Jeff Camkin 2023年11月30日至12月12日, 联合国气候变化框架公约(UNFCCC)第二十八次缔约方大会(COP28)在阿联酋举行, 本届世界气候行动峰会汇聚了154位国家元首和政府首脑。在峰会的最后阶段, 各方达成了几项重要协议, 包括""损失和损害""基金的操作化, 通过主席团青年气候倡导者加强儿童和青少年作为变革推动者的作用, 以及对""化石燃料使用的过渡 、减排和融资安排扩大""的操作化。 许多观察者和评论员认为, 这些协议(旨在于2030年之前采取更果断的气候行动, 以期将全球气温上升限制在1.5度以内)意味着对一个观点的认可, 即与 2019 年的水平相比, 2030年全球温室气体排放量需要减少43%才能实现这一目标。这包括加快逐步淘汰有增无减的煤电、逐步取消低效的化石燃料补贴, 以及加快一系列在能源系统中推动化石燃料转型的其他措施。建议以""发达国家继续带头的更加公平的发展方向""作为实现这些宏伟目标的路径, 如果可能的话, 在更接近2025年的时间内完成这些目标(即一年后!)。 其他研究人员指出, 紧急逐步淘汰化石燃料是必要的, 但还不够。Mazzucato等人(2023)认为, 即使我们明天就能实现经济脱碳, 但除非我们采取措施维护水系统和自然栖息地, 否则我们仍然不会拥有可持续的未来。作者论证, 有科学证据表明, ""自然损失本身就可能使我们无法实现巴黎气候协议的目标(即将全球变暖限制在比工业化前水平高1.5°C的范围内), 从而导致数百万生活在脆弱环境中的人将无法再适应""。此外, ""气候变化、生物多样性丧失和水不安全之间越来越明显的联系指出了一个根本问题:我们的经济系统建立在有缺陷的思维之上。当我们应该采取积极主动的战略来塑造经济以实现共同利益时, 我们却一直只对市场失灵作出反应""(同上)。 从 2014 年第一篇社论(Neto & Camkin, 2014)到 2023 年水在气候变化适应中的核心作用(Camkin & Neto, 2023), 我们一直呼吁人们关注水与可持续发展过程及目标的主要联系。如果没有脱碳, 就无法保护水资源和生物多样性。在环境及其提供的服务不受控制地枯竭的框架下, 各地对水及水资源的使用方式不平衡, 这无疑加剧了极端气候。2023年是有史以来最热的一年, 气温急剧上升, 许多国家发生严重火灾, 许多地区发生洪水。2023年, 我们看到所有这些极端情况如何对本已脆弱的人群和社区产生越来越大的影响, 使更多人无家可归, 并增加气候难民的数量。 这一困难下也出现了许多积极行动。例如, 在欧洲, 《欧洲可持续发展报告标准》(ESRS)自2024年1月1日起强制执行, 要求所有公司报告其运营和价值链中的水风险。这项关于水的强制性报告旨在帮助企业理解(1)由于对水的依赖而产生的重大风险和机遇;(2)公司的活动可能对水资源造成的影响;(3)公司为防止负面影响并促进更广泛的欧盟水目标而采取的行动(ESRS 2023)。 当然, 任何单一行动都不足以应对巨大且内在相互关联的挑战;在任何情况下都不能再忽视与水有关的问题。挑战不小, 并且是必要的。水循环、其领土联系、环境、经济用途和资源、治理——总而言之——需要能力和战略眼光。不幸的是, 能力和战略眼光都不充足, 这要求真正的变革行动者付出加倍的努力。 考虑到气候变化的规模及其影响, 最新的COP 28能为道路带来一丝曙光。但当我们审视正在发生的事情时, 这并不是一个完全乐观的前景。世界各地的行动者呼吁采取更明确的脱碳行动, 但遗憾的是, 尽管《巴黎协定》和去年底迪拜COP大会作出了最终决策, 许多地区仍继续支持和大力资助以化石燃料为基础的诸多活动。正如一些机构指出的那样, 许多国家""仍致力于在未来几年达到化石燃料使用的峰值……而已经批准并同意欧盟目标和新欧盟指令的国家仍然对化石燃料提供补贴""(Oikonomou, 2023)。例如, 在希腊, 三个环保组织已向欧盟委员会提出正式投诉, 指控希腊系统性地为希腊海岸附近的石油天然气钻探提供免费通行证, 违反了欧盟和国家法律。 由于COP28如此重要, 我们邀请了澳大利亚水伙伴关系总经理Sarah Ransom为本期撰写一篇客座社论, 题为《从迪拜归来:气候会议中对水的反思》。Sarah基于她参加过往COP大会的经历, 对COP28的现实情况提供了许多相关见解。Sarah总结道:""水社区有机会在两方面作出重大贡献, 第一, 通过快速发展的举措量化其对气候缓解的贡献, 并支持能源转型, 将全球变暖控制在1.5度内(UN Water, 2023), 第二, 确保我们的技能和知识帮助社区和生态系统建立复原力并在需要时进行适应。"" 接下来的18篇论文涉及广泛的水问题, 它们都与""改善研究、政策、实践和学习之间的联系""这一需求有关, 特别是在快速变化的全球情境下。 在《媒体是否没有真正理解美国的跨国海水淡化厂白日梦?》这篇论文中, Brian F. O'Neill以美国西南部和墨西哥的大规模海水淡化为例, 探究了媒体在传播""水政策和基础设施项目等全球重大跨边界问题""信息中所发挥的作用。在《与水资源利用相关的刑事犯罪预防问题》一文中, Nurlan Apakhayev和合著者借鉴哈萨克斯坦和其他地方的经验, 报告了他们对与水体有关的刑事犯罪的调查情况, 并提出制定一系列旨在打击此类犯罪的新战略和项目。水质管理是本期《全球水政策》(WWP)的重点内容。考虑到埃及立法规定的环境限制和行业特定参数, Doaa Abdou和Eid El–Ragehy在《解锁清洁水源的解决方案:埃及及其他地区的工业废水质量指数(IWQI)》一文中提出了一项工业水质指数。在题为《探究地下水与气候变化的相互作用:关于Philippe Cullet所著的⟨地下水与气候变化:多层次法律与政策视角⟩的批判性评论》的书评中, Kulsum Fatima分析了所提出的关键论点, 批判分析了该书对环境法和政策领域的贡献, 特别是与""气候变化和地下水之间的相互作用""有关的方面。 将焦点转回到北美, Holly Wilts、David Burton和Aitazaz Farooque在《结合短期轮作蒿柳的河岸缓冲区设计比较:缓解爱德华王子岛Dunk河流域的地表水污染》一文中探讨了不同河岸缓冲区配置的效能, 并识别了保护地表水免受污染的最佳缓冲区。在《尼日利亚小旱季期间的极端降雨和趋势》一文中, Joseph Omoniyi Adejuwon对尼日利亚的""小旱季""(雨季中的旱季)进行了分析, 这在西非是一种有趣的现象, 因为其对农业和粮食生产造成了影响。Vishal Narain和Chanda Goodrich在题为《玻璃杯是半空还是半满?南亚水资源综合管理中的性别问题》的讨论文中分析了南亚水务部门性别主流化举措影响力有限的原因, 指出了在地方父权式决策结构中为妇女保留席位一事对于改变现状几乎没有作用。 借鉴湄公河等沿岸国家的经验以及国际水法的共同立法框架, Hoa Thanh Ha和Tuan Van Vu在其论文《迫切呼吁对跨边界水道的保护和利用:一些立法反思》中讨论了""建立专门的国际水管理委员会""这一迫切需要。通过指出快速且频繁的洪水区制图对于监测和减轻洪水灾害而言至关重要, Sainath Reddy Poli和R. Bhavani在题为《安得拉邦 Nandigama 区域的洪水评估:使用水文和水力模型》的论文中报告了Nandigama洪水淹没制图及其对""规划和管理防洪基础设施""的启示。由于农业活动的高度扩张和土地使用管理不善, 土壤侵蚀成为埃塞俄比亚的一大挑战, 鉴于此, Eyasu Tafese Mekuria的论文《沉积物产量评估和缓解措施建议:埃塞俄比亚奥莫-吉贝盆地Deme流域案例研究》报告了沉积物产量评估并提出了一系列可将沉积物产量减少高达90%的缓解措施。 Amit Kumar Sharma和合著者在题为《关于浮游生物作为生物指示剂的述评:一项监测水质的有用工具》的文章中研究了生物指示剂在水资源管理中越来越多的使用, 并强调了关于一系列浮游生物为水质管理提供机遇的近期研究。继续围绕水质主题, Eskinder Zinabu及其合著者撰写的《评估水机构的结构和安排, 以提出用于水质管理和污染控制的河道内建模:来自埃塞俄比亚阿瓦什流域的见解》一文批判性分析了现有模型和支持环境, 并提出""提高机构能力""一事所需的变革。Rajneesh Kumar和Rajendra Prasad Mahapatra在其论文《使用混合深度学习模型预测北方邦自然灾害的严重程度和作物产量》中探讨了作物产量预测方法的缺点, 并提出了一系列用于更好地结合自然灾害(干旱、冰雹)与风暴严重程度的方法, 以支持实时农业实践与水质保护。El Khoumsi Wafae和合著者在其文章《处理后的废水灌溉对观赏植物的影响:以摩洛哥的马缨丹和朱槿为例》中表明, 使用处理过的废水进行灌溉通常会促进更好的生长, 强调了处理过的废水和地下滴灌相结合的潜力, 以用于绿地灌溉。 尼泊尔年降雨量高, 但在确保良好水质方面仍面临诸多挑战。在题为《分析尼泊尔拉姆琼贝西萨哈农村和城市地区的饮用水质参数, 以实现可持续发展目标》的论文中, Mahendra Aryal报告了一项对""来自不同水源的27个水样""的分析, 结果表明, 需要政府大力参与水资源管理和一系列发展, 以确保可持续性。Alebachew Shumye Moges和Sisay Assefa Wondimagegn将我们带回埃塞俄比亚, 他们的文章题为《评价埃塞俄比亚上阿瓦什盆地水土保持干预措施的有效性》。文章调查了社区态度并评估了不同保护方法在增强土壤理化特性、减少水土流失和侵蚀、以及最大限度提高土地生产力方面的有效性。在《评估地下水质、健康风险和政策启示:印度西孟加拉邦西梅迪尼布尔县案例研究》一文中, Md Anjar Alam、Damodhara Rao Mailapalli和Basant Maheshwari探讨了潜在的健康风险, 强调了地下水质的复杂性以及""全面的水政策和管理战略""的必要性。最后, Bitew K. Dessie和合著者在《埃塞俄比亚上阿瓦什盆地阿卡基流域的污染挑战和结果:政策改革与行动的证据》一文中对以往和当前的研究进行了报告。作者发现, 尽管联邦和地区层面有良好的法律和标准, 但由于实施或执行不力, 环境污染并未得到预防, 因此建议采取一套具体而紧急的政策措施。 感谢我们所有的作者以及众多自愿花时间支持本期《世界水政策》的审稿人。我们相信您会享受阅读本期内容, 受益于来自世界各地的、""关于水政策、实践以及支持它们的学习""的丰富见解。. 我们期待您的投稿。 献上最美好的祝愿 Susana Neto, Jeff Camkin 关键词 气候变化, COP 28, 水质, 水政策与实践, 水资源综合管理, 水政策. Del 30 de noviembre al 12 de diciembre de 2023 se celebró en los Emiratos Árabes Unidos la 28 Conferencia de las Partes (COP28) de la Convención Marco de las Naciones Unidas sobre el Cambio Climático (CMNUCC), esta Cumbre Mundial sobre Acción Climática reunió a 154 Jefes de Estado y de Gobierno. En la etapa final de la Cumbre, las Partes alcanzaron varios acuerdos importantes, incluida la puesta en funcionamiento del fondo para pérdidas y daños, que refuerza el papel de los niños y los jóvenes como agentes de cambio a través del liderazgo juvenil climático de la Presidencia, hasta la puesta en práctica de la transición desde el uso de combustibles fósiles, recortes de emisiones y acuerdos de financiación ampliados. Según muchos observadores y comentaristas, los acuerdos, que apuntan a una acción climática más decisiva antes del final de la década para mantener el límite de temperatura global de 1,5°C, implican el reconocimiento de que las emisiones globales de gases de efecto invernadero deben reducirse en un 43% para 2030. en comparación con los niveles de 2019, para lograr ese objetivo. Esto incluye acelerar los esfuerzos hacia la reducción gradual de la energía a base de carbón, eliminar gradualmente los subsidios ineficientes a los combustibles fósiles y otras medidas que impulsen la transición para alejarse de los combustibles fósiles en los sistemas energéticos. Se sugiere que la dirección hacia un desarrollo más equitativo, en el que los países desarrollados sigan a la cabeza, es el camino para alcanzar esos ambiciosos objetivos y, si es posible, más cerca de 2025 (¡dentro de un año!). Otros investigadores señalan que la urgente eliminación gradual de los combustibles fósiles es necesaria pero no suficiente. Mazzucato et al. (2023) consideran que incluso si pudiéramos descarbonizar la economía mañana, todavía no tendríamos un futuro sostenible hasta que tomemos medidas para mantener los sistemas hídricos y los hábitats naturales. Los autores sostienen que existe evidencia científica de que ""la pérdida de naturaleza por sí sola puede hacernos fracasar en el objetivo del acuerdo climático de París de limitar el calentamiento global a 1,5°C por encima de los niveles preindustriales, marcando el comienzo de un mundo donde millones de personas en entornos vulnerables ya no podría adaptarse"". Además, ""los vínculos cada vez más documentados entre el cambio climático, la pérdida de biodiversidad y la inseguridad hídrica apuntan a una cuestión fundamental: nuestros sistemas económicos se basan en un pensamiento erróneo. Siempre estamos reaccionando a las fallas del mercado cuando deberíamos buscar estrategias proactivas para configurar la economía para el bien común"" (Ibid). Hemos llamado la atención sobre las principales conexiones del agua con el proceso y los objetivos de desarrollo sostenible, desde nuestro primer editorial en 2014 (Neto y Camkin, 2014) hasta el papel central del agua en la adaptación al cambio climático en 2023 (Camkin & Neto, 2023). La salvaguardia de los recursos hídricos y la biodiversidad no se puede lograr sin la descarbonización. El uso desequilibrado del agua y sus recursos en todas partes, en un marco de agotamiento incontrolado del medio ambiente y de los servicios que éste proporciona, ha contribuido sin duda a la intensificación de los extremos climáticos. 2023 fue el año más caluroso jamás registrado (CE, 2023), con un aumento crítico de las temperaturas, incendios graves en muchos países e inundaciones en muchas regiones. En 2023 vimos cómo todos estos extremos están teniendo un impacto cada vez mayor en poblaciones y comunidades que ya son vulnerables, dejando a más personas sin hogar y aumentando el número de refugiados climáticos. En medio de la oscuridad hay muchas acciones positivas. En Europa, por ejemplo, los Estándares Europeos de Informes de Sostenibilidad (ESRS) se aplicaron a partir del 1 de enero de 2024, lo que obliga a todas las empresas a informar los riesgos hídricos en sus operaciones y cadenas de valor. Este informe obligatorio sobre el agua tiene como objetivo ayudar a las empresas a comprender (1) los riesgos y oportunidades materiales que surgen de su dependencia del agua; (2) los impactos que las actividades de una empresa pueden tener en los recursos hídricos; y (3) las acciones que una empresa está tomando para prevenir impactos negativos y contribuir a los objetivos hídricos más amplios de la UE (ESRS 2023). Por supuesto, ninguna acción por sí sola es suficiente para hacer frente a los enormes desafíos intrínsecamente interconectados; Las cuestiones relacionadas con el agua ya no pueden ignorarse en ningún contexto. El desafío no es pequeño ni prescindible. El ciclo del agua, sus vínculos territoriales, el medio ambiente, los usos y recursos económicos, la gobernanza -en una palabra- requieren competencia y visión estratégica. Desafortunadamente, ambos no abundan, lo que exige esfuerzos multiplicados por parte de los verdaderos agentes del cambio. Dada la escala de los cambios climáticos y sus efectos, la última COP 28 puede arrojar algo de luz sobre el camino. Pero no es una perspectiva enteramente optimista cuando analizamos lo que efectivamente está sucediendo. Los actores de todo el mundo claman por acciones más claras para la descarbonización pero, lamentablemente, muchas de las actividades basadas en combustibles fósiles siguen siendo apoyadas y fuertemente financiadas en muchas regiones, a pesar del Acuerdo de París y las decisiones finales de la Conferencia de las Partes en Dubai en finales del año pasado. Como lo señalaron varias agencias, muchos países ""todavía apuntan a alcanzar el máximo uso de combustibles fósiles en los próximos años … y los países que han ratificado y acordado los objetivos de la Unión Europea y las nuevas directivas de la UE, todavía subsidian los combustibles fósiles"". (Oikonomou, 2023). Por ejemplo, en Grecia, tres organizaciones ambientalistas han presentado una queja formal ante la Comisión Europea contra Grecia por dar sistemáticamente vía libre a las perforaciones de petróleo y gas frente a las costas griegas, en violación de las leyes nacionales y de la UE. Debido a que la COP28 fue tan importante, invitamos a Sarah Ransom, Gerente General de Australian Water Partnership, a escribir un editorial invitado para esta edición, titulado Regresando de Dubai: Reflexiones sobre el agua en la Conferencia sobre el Clima. Sarah brinda muchas ideas relevantes sobre las realidades de la COP28, basándose en su experiencia de haber asistido también a COP anteriores. Sarah concluye que ""hay una oportunidad por delante para que la comunidad del agua haga una contribución significativa tanto a la lucha por los 1,5º C como para garantizar que nuestras habilidades y conocimientos ayuden a las comunidades y los ecosistemas a desarrollar resiliencia y adaptarse donde sea necesario, siguiendo el llamado de la ONU. que los profesionales del agua desempeñen un papel en la acción climática en esta década crítica"". Los siguientes 18 artículos abordan una amplia gama de cuestiones relacionadas con el agua, todas ellas vinculadas a la necesidad de mejorar la conexión entre la investigación, las políticas, la práctica y el aprendizaje, particularmente en el contexto global que cambia rápidamente. En el artículo, ¿Los medios no entienden la quimera transnacional estadounidense de la desalinización? Brian F. O'Neill utiliza el ejemplo de la desalinización de agua de mar a gran escala en el suroeste de Estados Unidos y México para explorar el papel que desempeñan los medios en la difusión de información sobre cuestiones transfronterizas de importancia mundial, como las políticas hídricas y los proyectos de infraestructura. Basándose en experiencias de Kazajstán y otros lugares, Nurlan Apakhayev y sus coautores informan sobre su investigación sobre delitos penales relacionados con masas de agua y proponen el desarrollo de nuevas estrategias y programas destinados a contrarrestar dichos delitos en Problemas de prevención de delitos penales relacionados con el uso. de Recursos Hídricos. La gestión de la calidad del agua ocupa un lugar destacado en este número de WWP. Teniendo en cuenta tanto los límites ambientales especificados por la legislación egipcia como los parámetros específicos de la industria, Doaa Abdou y Eid El—Ragehy proponen un índice de calidad del agua industrial para desbloquear soluciones para aguas más limpias: el índice de calidad de las aguas residuales industriales (IWQI) en Egipto y más allá. En una reseña del libro ""Exploring Groundwater-Climate Change Interactions: A Critical Review of Groundwater and Climate Change: Multi-Level Law and Policy Perspectives"" de Philippe Cullet, Kulsum Fatima examina los argumentos clave presentados, analizando críticamente la contribución del libro al campo del medio ambiente. Leyes y políticas, particularmente en relación con las interacciones entre el cambio climático y las aguas subterráneas. Al regresar a América del Norte, Holly Wilts, David Burton y Aitazaz Farooque discuten la eficacia de varias configuraciones de zonas de amortiguamiento ribereñas e identifican zonas de amortiguamiento óptimas para proteger el agua superficial de la contaminación en Una comparación de diseños de zonas de amortiguamiento ribereñas que incorporan Salix viminalis de rotación corta para mitigar la contaminación del agua superficial. en la cuenca del río Dunk en la Isla del Príncipe Eduardo. En Rainfall Extremes and TrendsDurante la pequeña estación seca en Nigeria, Joseph Omoniyi Adejuwon presenta a continuación un análisis de la ""pequeña estación seca"" en Nigeria -un período seco en medio de la estación húmeda- que es un fenómeno de interés en África occidental debido a su impactos en la agricultura y la producción de alimentos.

The high spatial and temporal coverage provided by satellite data can be used to reconstruct past events and continuously monitor sensitive areas for potential hazards. This paper presents a range of techniques and methods that were applied for in-depth analysis and utilization of Earth observation data, with a particular emphasis on: (1) detecting mining subsidence, where a novel approach is proposed by combining an improved U-Net model and Interferometry Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) technology. The results showed that the Efficient Channel Attention (ECA) U-Net model performed better than the U-Net (baseline) model in terms of Mean Intersection over Union (MIoU) and Intersection over Union (IoU) indicators; (2) monitoring water conservancy and hydropower engineering. The Xiaolangdi multipurpose dam complex was monitored using Small BAsline Subsets (SBAS) InSAR method on Sentinel-1 time series data and four small regions with high deformation rates were identified on the slope of the reservoir bank on the north side. The dam body also showed obvious deformation with a velocity exceeding 60 mm/a; (3) the evaluation of the potential of InSAR results to integrate monitoring and warning systems for valuable heritage and architectural preservation. The overall outcome of these methods showed that the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques in combination with InSAR data leads to more efficient analysis and interpretation, resulting in improved accuracy and prompt identification of potential hazards; and (4) finally, this study also presents a method for detecting landslides in mountainous regions, using optical imagery. The new temporal landslide detection method is evaluated over a 7-year analysis period and unlike conventional bi-temporal change detection methods, this approach does not depend on any prior-knowledge and can potentially detect landslides over extended periods of time such as decades.","",https://doi.org/10.1080/10095020.2023.2234008,"",,

The surface water bodies and other crucial natural resources in the study area are being depleted at an alarming rate. This study explored the implications of the changing land-use diversity on surface water resources by using a random forest (RF) classifier machine-learning algorithm and remote-sensing models in Gauteng Province, South Africa. Landsat datasets from 1993 to 2022 were used and processed in the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform, using the RF classifier. The results indicate nine land-use diversity classes having increased and decreased tendencies, with high F-score values ranging from 72.3% to 100%. In GP, the spatial coverage of BL has shrunk by 100.4 km2 every year over the past three decades. Similarly, BuA exhibits an annual decreasing rate of 42.4 km2 due to the effect of dense vegetation coverage within the same land use type. Meanwhile, water bodies, marine quarries, arable lands, grasslands, shrublands, dense forests, and wetlands were expanded annually by 1.3, 2.3, 2.9, 5.6, 11.2, 29.6, and 89.5 km2, respectively.

The infrequency and duration of HABs occurrence pose the challenge of data imbalance when constructing machine learning models for their prediction. Furthermore, the appropriate selection of input variables is a significant issue because of the complexities between the input and output variables. Therefore, the objective of this study was to improve the predictive performance of HABs using feature selection and data resampling. Data resampling was used to address the imbalance in the minority class data. Two machine learning models were constructed to predict algal alert levels using 10 years of meteorological, hydrodynamic, and water quality data. The improvement in model accuracy due to changes in resampling methods was more noticeable than the improvement in model accuracy due to changes in feature selection methods. Models constructed using combinations of original and synthetic data across all resampling methods demonstrated higher prediction performance for the caution level (L-1) and warning level (L-2) than models constructed using the original data. In particular, the optimal artificial neural network and random forest models constructed using combinations of original and synthetic data showed significantly improved prediction accuracy for L-1 and L-2, representing the transition from normal to bloom formation states in the training and testing steps. The test results of the optimal RF model using the original data indicated prediction accuracies of 98.8% for L0, 50.0% for L1, and 50.0% for L2. In contrast, the optimal random forest model using the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique-Edited Nearest Neighbor (ENN) sampling method achieved accuracies of 85.0% for L0, 85.7% for L1, and 100% for L2. Therefore, applying synthetic data can address the imbalance in the observed data and improve the detection performance of machine learning models. Reliable predictions using improved models can support the design of management practices to mitigate HABs in reservoirs and ultimately ensure safe and clean water resources.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/toxics11120955,"",,
rayyan-224211677,High resolution downscaling of CMIP6 Earth System and Global Climate Models using deep learning for Iberia,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract. Deep learning (DL) methods have recently garnered attention from the climate change community, as an innovative approach for downscaling climate variables from Earth System and Global Climate Models (ESGCMs) with horizontal resolutions still too coarse to represent regional-to-local-scale phenomena. In the context of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 6 (CMIP6), ESGCMs simulations were conducted for the Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), at resolutions ranging from 0.70º to 3.75º. Here, four Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures were evaluated for their ability to downscale, to a resolution of 0.1º, seven CMIP6 ESGCMs over the Iberian Peninsula - a known climate change hotspot, due to its increased vulnerability to projected future warming and drying conditions. The study is divided into three stages: (1) evaluating the performance of the four CNN architectures in predicting mean, minimum, and maximum temperatures, as well as daily precipitation, trained using ERA5 data, and compared with the Iberia01 observational dataset; (2) downscaling the CMIP6 ESGCMs using the trained CNN architectures and further evaluating the ensemble against Iberia01; and (3) constructing a multi-model ensemble of CNN-based downscaled projections for temperature and precipitation over the Iberian Peninsula at 0.1º resolution throughout the 21st century, under four Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) scenarios. Upon validation and satisfactory performance evaluation, the DL downscaled projections demonstrate overall agreement with the CMIP6 ESGCM ensemble in terms of temperature and precipitation projections. Moreover, the advantages of using a high-resolution DL downscaled ensemble of ESGCM climate projections are evident, offering substantial added value in representing regional climate change over Iberia. Notably, a clear warming trend is observed, consistent with previous studies in this area, with projected temperature increases ranging from 2 ºC to 6 ºC depending on the climate scenario. Regarding precipitation, robust projected decreases are observed in western and southwestern Iberia, particularly after 2040. These results may offer a new tool for providing regional climate change information for adaptation strategies based on CMIP6 ESGCMs prior to the next phase of the European branch from the Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment (EURO-CORDEX) experiments.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-2023-136,"",,
rayyan-224211683,Groundwater monitoring and specific yield estimation using time-lapse electrical resistivity imaging and machine learning,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"This paper presents an alternative method for monitoring groundwater levels and estimating specific yields of an unconfined aquifer under different seasonal conditions. The approach employs the Time-Lapse Electrical Resistivity Imaging (TL-ERI) method and machine learning-based time series clustering. A TL-ERI survey was conducted at ten sites (WS01-WS10 sites) throughout the dry and wet seasons, with five-time measurements collected for each site, in the Taichung-Nantou Basin along the Wu River, Central Taiwan. The obtained resistivity raw data was inverted and converted into normalized water content values using Archie’s law, followed by applying the Van Genuchten (VG) model for the Soil Water Characteristic Curve to estimate the Groundwater Level (GWL), and estimated the theoretical specific yield ( S y ) by computing the difference between the saturated and residual water contents of the fitted VG model. In addition, the specific yield capacity ( S c ), representing the nature of the storage capacity in the aquifer, was also calculated. The results showed that this approach was able to estimate those hydrogeological parameters. The spatial distribution of the GWL reveals that during the dry-wet seasons from February to July, there was a high GWL that extended from southeast to northwest. Conversely, during the wet-dry seasons from July to October, the high GWL shrank, which can be attributed to recharge variations from rainfall events. The determined spatial distribution of S y and S c fall within the range of 0.03–0.24 and 0.14–0.25, respectively. To quantitatively establish areas of similar groundwater level changes along with the VG model parameter variations during the study period, a Time series Clustering analysis (TSC) was performed by utilizing Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering (HAC). The findings suggest that the WS03 site is a promising area for further investigation due to its highest S c value with a slight change in groundwater levels during the dry and wet seasons. This study brings an advanced development of the geoelectrical method to estimate regional hydrogeological parameters in an area with limited available groundwater observation wells, in different seasonal conditions for groundwater management purposes.","",https://doi.org/10.3389/fenvs.2023.1197888,"",,

This study aims to develop a model to comprehensively monitor various water quality parameters (WQP) and evaluate the feasibility of implementing this model in real-world scenarios, addressing the limitations of conventional in-situ sampling. Thus, a comprehensive model for monitoring WQP was developed using a 38-year dataset of Landsat imagery and in-situ data from the Water Information System of Europe (WISE), employing Back-Propagated Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). Correlation analyses revealed strong associations between remote sensing data and various WQPs, including Total Suspended Solids (TSS), chlorophyll-a (chl-a), Dissolved Oxygen (DO), Total Nitrogen (TN), and Total Phosphorus (TP). Optimal band combinations for each parameter were identified, enhancing the accuracy of the WQP estimation. The ANN-based model exhibited very high accuracy, particularly for chl-a and TSS (R2 &gt; 0.90, NRMSE &lt; 0.79%), surpassing previous studies. The independent validation showcased accurate classification for TSS and TN, while DO estimation faced challenges during high variation periods, highlighting the complexity of DO dynamics. The usability of the developed model was successfully tested in a real-case scenario, proving to be an operational tool for water management. Future research avenues include exploring additional data sources for improved model accuracy, potentially enhancing predictions and expanding the model’s utility in diverse environmental contexts.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/rs16010068,"",,

Due to the vast extent and dynamic nature of river systems, Earth Observation (EO) is one of the best ways to measure river characteristics. As a first step, EO-based river monitoring often requires extraction of accurate pixel-level water masks, but satellite images traditionally used for this purpose suffer from limited spatial and/or temporal resolution. We address this problem by applying a novel Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based model to automate water mask extraction from daily 3 m resolution PlanetScope satellite imagery. Notably, this approach overcomes radiometric issues that frequently present limitations when working with CubeSat data. We test our classification model on 36 rivers across 12 global terrestrial biomes (as proxies for the environmental and physical characteristics that lead to the variability in catchments around the globe). Using a relatively shallow CNN classification model, our approach produced a median F1 accuracy score of 0.93, suggesting that a compact and efficient CNN-based model can work as well as, if not better than, the very deep neural networks conventionally used in similar studies, whilst requiring less training data and computational power. We further show that our model, specialised to the task at hand, performs better than a state-of-the-art Fully Convolutional Neural Network (FCN) that struggles with the highly variable image quality from PlanetScope. Although classifying rivers that were narrower than 60 m, anastomosed or highly urbanised was slightly less successful than our other test images, we showed that fine tuning could circumvent these limitations to some degree. Indeed, fine tuning carried out on the Ottawa River, Canada, by including just 5 additional site-specific training images significantly improved classification accuracy (F1 increased from 0.81 to 0.90, p < 0.01). Overall, our results show that CNN-based classification applied to PlanetScope imagery is a viable tool for producing accurate, temporally dynamic river water masks, opening up possibilities for river monitoring investigations where high temporal variability data is essential.","",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2023.113932,"",,

We assess three machine learning (ML) models - artificial neural network (ANN), recurrent neural network (RNN), and adaptive fuzzy neural inference system (ANFIS) - for streamflow prediction under the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 6 (CMIP6) Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs), specifically SSP245 and SSP585. Four key performance indicators, mean square error (MSE), root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and coefficient of determination (R2), guide the evaluation. These models employ monthly precipitation, maximum and minimum temperatures as inputs, and discharge as the output, spanning 1985-2014. The ANN model with a 3-10-1 architecture outperforms RNN and ANFIS, displaying lower MSE, RMSE, MAE, and higher R2 values for both training (MSE = 20417, RMSE = 142, MAE = 71, R2 = 0.94) and testing (MSE = 9348, RMSE = 96, MAE = 108, R2 = 0.92) datasets.

rayyan-224211827,Climate change impact assessment on groundwater level changes: A study of hybrid model techniques,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract One of the most important sources of water supply is groundwater. However, the groundwater level (GWL) is significantly impacted by the global climate change. Therefore, under these more severe climate change conditions, the accurate and simple forecast of farmland GWL is a crucial component of agricultural water management. A hybrid model (HM) of Bayesian random forest (BRF), Bayesian support vector machine (BSVM), and Bayesian artificial neural network (BANN) is built in this study. The HM is made up of a Bayesian model averaging (BMA) and three machine learning models: random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and artificial neural network. These three HMs are employed to help automate logical inference and decision‐making in business intelligence for groundwater management. For this purpose, data on 8 separate climatic factors that impact GWL changes in the study area were acquired. Nine distinct farming communities' GWL change data were utilised as the dependent variables for each model fit (community data). The effectiveness of the HM techniques was assessed using the evaluation metrics of mean absolute error (MAE), coefficient of determination ( R 2 ), mean absolute percent error (MAPE), and root mean square error (RMSE). The model fit in Suhum had the greatest performance with the highest accuracy ( R 2 varied from 0.9051 to 0.9679) and the lowest error scores (RMSE ranged from 0.0653 to 0.0727, and MAE ranged from 0.0121 to 0.0541), according to the models' evaluation results. The BRF delivered the greatest results when compared to the two independent HMs, the BSVM and BANN. Future GWL and climatic variable data may be trained using the trained HM techniques to determine the effects of climate change. Farmers, businesses, and civil society organisations might benefit from continuous monitoring of GWL data and education on climate change to help control and prevent excessive deteriorations of global climate change on GWL.","",https://doi.org/10.1049/sil2.12227,"",,

Three machine learning methods, including long short-term memory neural network (LSTM), convolutional neural network (CNN), and categorical boosting (CatBoost), were constructed for hydrological and agricultural drought forecasting. The propagation time from meteorological drought to surface water storage and terrestrial water storage drought, evaluated by the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index, was 8 and 11 months with Pearson correlation coefficients (R) of 0.68 and 0.48, respectively. Groundwater storage drought was correlated with evapotranspiration and vegetation growth with a 12-month lag time, respectively.

Earth's drylands are home to more than two billion people, provide key ecosystem services, and exert a large influence on the trends and variability in Earth's carbon cycle. However, modeling dryland carbon and water fluxes with remote sensing suffers from unique challenges not typically encountered in mesic systems, particularly in capturing soil moisture stress. Here, we develop and evaluate an approach for the joint modeling of dryland gross primary production (GPP), net ecosystem exchange (NEE), and evapotranspiration (ET) in the western United States (US) using a suite of AmeriFlux eddy covariance sites spanning major functional types and aridity regimes. We use artificial neural networks (ANNs) to predict dryland ecosystem fluxes by fusing optical vegetation indices, multitemporal thermal observations, and microwave soil moisture and temperature retrievals from the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) sensor. Our new dryland ANN (DrylANNd) carbon and water flux model explains more than 70 % of monthly variance in GPP and ET, improving upon existing MODIS GPP and ET estimates at most dryland eddy covariance sites. DrylANNd predictions of NEE were considerably worse than its predictions of GPP and ET likely because soil and plant respiratory processes are largely invisible to satellite sensors. Optical vegetation indices, particularly the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and near-infrared reflectance of vegetation (NIRv), were generally the most important variables contributing to model skill. However, daytime and nighttime land surface temperatures and SMAP soil moisture and soil temperature also contributed to model skill, with SMAP especially improving model predictions of shrubland, grassland, and savanna fluxes and land surface temperatures improving predictions in evergreen needleleaf forests. Our results show that a combination of optical vegetation indices and thermal infrared and microwave observations can substantially improve estimates of carbon and water fluxes in drylands, potentially providing the means to better monitor vegetation function and ecosystem services in these important regions that are undergoing rapid hydroclimatic change.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-383-2023,"",,

Nevertheless, the execution efficiency of this integrated system still needs to be promoted to meet the demand for real-time forecasting of urban floods. The objective of this study is to seek an alternative for predicting water levels both in the sewer system and on the streets within an urban district during rainstorms by utilizing a dynamic neuron network model. To strengthen the physical structure of the artificial intelligence (AI) model and simultaneously make up for the lack of measured data, simulation results of the 1D/1D SWMM model are provided as labels for the training of the proposed model. The novelty of this research is to propose a new methodology to effectively train the AI model for predicting the spatial distributions of depths based on the hydrologic conditions, geomorphologic properties, as well as the network relation of the drainage system. A two-stage training procedure is proposed in this study to consider more possible inundation conditions in both sewer and street (open channel) drainage networks. The research findings show that the proposed methodology is capable of reaching satisfactory accuracy and assisting the numerical-based SWMM model for real-time warning of drainage systems in the urban district.","",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2023.119099,"",,
rayyan-224212005,Identification of the inflow source in a foul sewer system through techniques of inverse modelling,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract Infiltration and illegal inflow into foul sewer systems can cause different problems such as a decrease in the performance of treatment plants, the surcharge of pipelines and more frequent overflows, which cause negative impacts on the environment. Water companies are increasingly been driven to address these problems by reducing infiltrations and identifying the sources of illegal inflows. Overall, the traditional techniques applied in these cases are expensive and time consuming and many times only partially efficient. Examples are the use of CCTV inspections, smoke tests and the installation of a large set of sensors to collect continuous data such as flow rates, water levels, temperature or concentrations of pollutants. The aim of this study is to apply two types of inverse numerical techniques to identify the source location of illegal inflows into wastewater systems based on information collected at the outlet of the drained basin and a calibrated numerical model of the sewer network. In this work, the numerical model is developed using the Storm Water Management Model (SWMM) software distributed by the Environmental Protection Agency (USA). We considered a realistic foul sewer system with known dimensional and hydrological characteristics. Synthetic case studies are set up to test the inverse approaches. Assuming a hypothetical rainfall event and an illegal inflow released at a certain location in the sewer system, the numerical model is run forward to obtain the flow hydrograph at the network outlet. This information is then used as available observations to perform the inverse modelling. The first investigated technique is an artificial neural network (ANN) of the feed-forward type. It will be trained to recover the inflow source using the simulation results of SWMM driven by a large set of rainfall events and inflows located at different positions in the sewer network. Once trained, the ANN will be used to identify the location of the inflow based the observed flood wave. The second procedure derives from Kalman filter techniques: the Ensemble Smoother with Multiple Data Assimilation (ES-MDA). Also in this case, the method, starting from the known rainfall event and the observed flow hydrograph, is used to locate the inflow source. In addition to the results of the synthetic case obtained by means of the two procedures, the field applicability to real case studies will be discussed.","",https://doi.org/10.1088/1742-6596/2444/1/012011,"",,
rayyan-224212030,Drought Forecasting: Application of Ensemble and Advanced Machine Learning Approaches,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Depending on the severity and spatial-temporal variability, droughts can have a wide range of impacts such as crop failure, water shortages, and food insecurity. Accurate and timely forecasting is necessary to mitigate the hazards of extreme weather events, such as droughts, brought on by climate change. A district like Chitradurga in India, which typically receives around 450-600mm of annual rainfall, will require advanced drought mitigation strategies and plans before the onset of the drought. This research focuses on 1-step lead time forecasting of meteorological drought episodes making use of the 6-month Standardised Precipitation Index (SPI-6) as indicator. The fine resolution rainfall data (0.25° × 0.25°) obtained from the Indian Meteorological Department was used to derive the 6-month SPI data of 23 grid stations. The 1-step lead time SPI-6 time series was forecast considering the antecedent SPI-6 time series data as model input. The Mutual Information was used to determine the most relevant input features for drought forecasting. The standard Artificial Neural Network, an advanced machine learning framework - Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines, and the ensemble learning-based <italic xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"">CatBoost</i> Regression and Gradient Tree Boosting paradigms were employed to forecast drought episodes. Error and efficiency metrics were employed for performance evaluation of the simulated models. The multivariate adaptive regression splines and gradient tree boosting forecasts had slightly higher accuracy and lower error rates than the artificial neural network model, which suggests that they may be more reliable for drought forecasting. The root mean square error and normalized Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency ranges of the multivariate adaptive regression splines model (during test phase) were 0.37–0.54 and 0.78–0.87, respectively. The thematic maps that were created using spatial interpolation of model forecasts from all the stations also confirmed that the district as a whole experienced drought in April 2019.","",https://doi.org/10.1109/access.2023.3341587,"",,

This is in part due to the complex set of physical and social behaviors that interact to influence water management from local to global scales. Analyses of water resources have been conducted using a variety of techniques, including qualitative evaluations of media narratives. This study aims to augment these methods by leveraging computational and quantitative techniques from the social sciences focused on text analyses. Specifically, we use natural language processing methods to investigate a large corpus (approx. 1.8M) of newspaper articles spanning approximately 35 years (1982–2017) for insights into human-nature interactions with water. Focusing on local and regional United States publications, our analysis demonstrates important dynamics in water-related dialogue about drinking water and pollution to other critical infrastructures, such as energy, across different parts of the country. Our assessment, which looks at water as a system, also highlights key actors and sentiments surrounding water.

rayyan-224212078,A Comparison of the Statistical Downscaling and Long-Short-Term-Memory Artificial Neural Network Models for Long-Term Temperature and Precipitations Forecasting,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"General circulation models (GCMs) run at regional resolution or at a continental scale. Therefore, these results cannot be used directly for local temperatures and precipitation prediction. Downscaling techniques are required to calibrate GCMs. Statistical downscaling models (SDSM) are the most widely used for bias correction of GCMs. However, few studies have compared SDSM with multi-layer perceptron artificial neural networks and in most of these studies, results indicate that SDSM outperform other approaches. This paper investigates an alternative architecture of neural networks, namely the long-short-term memory (LSTM), to forecast two critical climate variables, namely temperature and precipitation, with an application to five climate gauging stations in the Lake Chad Basin. Lake Chad is a data scarce area which has been impacted by severe drought, where water resources have been influenced by climate change and recent agricultural expansion. SDSM was used as the benchmark in this paper for temperature and precipitation downscaling for monthly time–scales weather prediction, using grid resolution GCM output at a 5 degrees latitude × 5 degrees longitude global grid. Three performance indicators were used in this study, namely the root mean square error (RMSE), to measure the sensitivity of the model to outliers, the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), to estimate the overall performance of the predictions, as well as the Nash Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE), which is a standard measure used in the field of climate forecasting. Results on the validation set for SDSM and test set for LSTM indicated that LSTM produced better accuracy on average compared to SDSM. For precipitation forecasting, the average RMSE and MAPE for LSTM were 33.21 mm and 24.82% respectively, while the average RMSE and MAPE for SDSM were 53.32 mm and 34.62% respectively. In terms of three year ahead minimum temperature forecasts, LSTM presents an average RMSE of 4.96 degree celsius and an average MAPE of 27.16%, while SDSM presents an average RMSE of 8.58 degree celsius and an average MAPE of 12.83%. For maximum temperatures forecast, LSTM presents an average RMSE of 4.27 degree celsius and an average MAPE of 11.09 percent, while SDSM presents an average RMSE of 9.93 degree celsius and an average RMSE of 12.07%. Given the results, LSTM may be a suitable alternative approach to downscale global climate simulation models’ output, to improve water management and long-term temperature and precipitations forecasting at local level.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/atmos14040708,"",,
rayyan-224212111,Predicting the performance of green stormwater infrastructure using multivariate long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"The expected performance of Green Stormwater Infrastructure (GSI) is typically quantified through numerical models based on hydrologic parameters and physics-based equations. With numerical models, the choice of a spatio-temporal discretization scheme for the computational domain is a strenuous task that requires extensive calibration and potentially lab-based parameters and experimentation. The performance of GSI has high temporal dynamics due to natural, anthropogenic, and climatic processes that are not well represented by the traditional physics-based hydrologic models, which are calibrated against only a few historical observations and have a user-defined and constrained set of computational outcomes. Deep learning-based predictive models, such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks, offer an exciting opportunity to quantify GSI performance, accounting for its highly dynamic and constantly evolving nature by leveraging advancements in observational data. A LSTM regression can overcome some of the limitations associated with traditional hydrological models to aid the development of a fully data-informed GSI performance predictor. To demonstrate the LSTM and traditional model outcomes, both methods were applied to a rain garden in Villanova, PA, USA. Specifically, an LSTM model was used to predict the recession of ponded water depth in the rain garden using five years of observed data. A set of eight predictors (i.e., precipitation, air temperature, soil temperature, soil moisture content at a depth of 10 cm, 35 cm, 65 cm and 91 cm, water depth) and a target variable (i.e., recession rate) were considered for training/testing the LSTM model. A comparative study with the USEPA Storm Water Management Model (SWMM) was performed to observe the performance of a physics-based model and a LSTM model for continuous recession rate time series and specific storms. The LSTM model had a performance score, Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), of 0.081 for the continuous time series, outperforming the SWMM performance with a score of 2.173 when compared to observed data. In the case of storm-specific prediction, LSTM also outperformed SWMM simulation for four storms with lower RMSE values when compared to the observed data. The application of the LSTM model in predicting GSI performance is a crucial stride towards efficient real-time forecasting.","",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2023.130076,"",,

Over the years, the researchers have investigated water monitoring approaches in terms of traditional monitoring or even integrated systems to handle such an environmental assessment and predictions based on warning systems. However, research into the selection and optimisation of water monitoring systems by the combination of parallel approach in terms of sampling techniques, process analysis and results is limited. The research objectives of the present study are to evaluate the existing water monitoring systems based on the latest approach and then provide insights into factors affecting sensor implementation at sampling locations. Here we summarize the advancement and trends of various water monitoring systems as well as the suitability of sensor placement in the area by reviewing more than 300 papers published between 2011 and 2022. The research highlights the urgency of an integrative approach with regard to water monitoring systems including water quality model and water quantity model. A framework is proposed to incorporate all water monitoring approaches, sampling techniques, and predictive models to provide comprehensive information about environmental assessment. It was observed that the urgency of model-based approaches as verification and fusion of data assemble has the ability to improve the performances of the systems. Furthermore, integrated systems with the inclusion of a separate modeling approach through integrated - semi-mechanistic models, data science and artificial intelligence are recommended in the future.

Understanding the temporal and spatial variations of salinity is a keystone of salinity-management practices. Process-based numerical models have been traditionally used to estimate the variations in salinity in estuarine environments. Advances in data-driven models (e.g., deep learning models) make them effective and efficient alternatives to process-based models. However, a discernible research gap exists in applying these advanced techniques to salinity modeling. The current study seeks to address this gap by exploring the innovative use of deep learning with data augmentation and transfer learning in salinity modeling, exemplified at 23 key salinity locations in the Sacramento–San Joaquin Delta which is the hub of the water-supply system of California. Historical, simulated (via a hydrodynamics and water quality model), and perturbed (to create a range of hydroclimatic and operational scenarios for data-augmentation purposes) flow, and salinity data are used to train a baseline multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and a deep learning Residual Long-Short-Term Memory (Res-LSTM) network. Four other deep learning models including LSTM, Residual Network (ResNet), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), and Residual GRU (Res-GRU) are also examined. Results indicate that models pre-trained using augmented data demonstrate improved performance over models trained from scratch using only historical data (e.g., median Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency increased from around 0.5 to above 0.9). Moreover, the five deep learning models further boost the salinity estimation performance in comparison with the baseline MLP model, though the performance of the latter is acceptable. The models trained using augmented data are then (a) used to develop a web-based Salinity Dashboard (Dashboard) tool that allows the users (including those with no machine learning background) to quickly screen multiple management scenarios by altering inputs and visualizing the resulting salinity simulations interactively, and (b) transferred and adapted to estimate observed salinity. The study shows that transfer learning results more accurately replicate the observations compared to their counterparts from models trained from scratch without knowledge learned and transferred from augmented data (e.g., median Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency increased from around 0.4 to above 0.9). Overall, the study illustrates that deep learning models, particularly when pre-trained using augmented data, are promising supplements to existing process-based models in estuarine salinity modeling, while the Dashboard enables user engagement with those pre-trained models to inform decision-making efficiently and effectively.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/w15132482,"",,

Field based methods estimate point-wise ET accurately, but the challenge is in estimating ET over a region with high accuracies. Machine learning based approaches were taken to estimate ET over a large spatial scale using the Bowen Ratio Energy Balance (BREB) technique. The BREB method depends on terrestrial energy balance equations to estimate ET. Thus, remote sensing-based parameters representing variables in the energy balance equation, and vegetation index representing plant health conditions were used in the model. The study was conducted in the arid areas of the southwestern United States, where dense patches of Salt cedar consume water from the primary water source. The preliminary model used enhanced vegetation index (EVI), global horizontal irradiance (GHI), surface temperature (TS), and relative humidity (RH) as parameters. The k-nearest neighbor method consistently generated poor accuracies. When all the parameters were used, accuracies of the other models varied within 90–94%. When one predictor parameter was dropped, the best model produced accuracies between 90 to 93%, which dropped to 87–92% when a second variable was dropped.

Especially the Mediterranean region has been identified as vulnerable to anthropogenic climate change due to a significant reduction in precipitation compared to other land regions in all climate models operated under different scenarios. Despite numerous studies on aridity trends, few have focused specifically on Türkiye and considered a comprehensive range of aridity indices and scenarios. This study aims to fill this research gap by providing a more detailed understanding of future aridity trends in Türkiye under various climate change scenarios and using multiple aridity indices. A novelty of this study lies in the simultaneous examination of three aridity indices (PCI, EAI and UNEP AI) for Türkiye, allowing for a more comprehensive assessment of future aridity trends. Furthermore, this study considers three future time periods (2011–2040, 2041–2070 and 2071–2100) and three shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs) to evaluate the potential range of climate change impacts on aridity in Türkiye. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to determine the changes in aridity conditions in Türkiye until the end of the 21st century. We used three aridity indices: the Pinna combinative index, the Erinç aridity index and the UNEP aridity index. These indices were calculated for the baseline period of 1981–2010 using gridded data (CHELSA) and for the periods of 2011–2040, 2041–2070 and 2071–2100 using three climate models (GFDL‐ESM4, MRI‐ESM2‐0 and IPSL‐CM6A‐LR) and multi‐model means with three SSPs to represent different future scenarios. The results showed that all three indices indicate an increase in dry climate conditions in Türkiye after 2041, with particularly notable increases expected in Central Anatolia, Southeastern Anatolia and parts of the Eastern Mediterranean, as well as eastern parts of Eastern Anatolia and the inner Aegean region. Under the SSP3‐7.0 scenario, the expansion of semi‐arid and arid areas is predicted to cover more than 30% of the country by the end of the century (2071–2100). This increase in aridity could increase the region's vulnerability to climate change and the risk of desertification, which should be taken into consideration in national water management and planning.","",https://doi.org/10.1002/joc.8201,"",,
rayyan-224212267,Towards improved knowledge about water-related extremes based on news media information captured using artificial intelligence,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Recent advances in machine learning have enabled near real-time retrieval of information from textual documents impacting a wide range of knowledge domains. This advantage makes of the insight extracted from text-based documents (e.g., reports and news) on water-related events an invaluable source of information that complements traditional approaches. By leveraging machine learning, we can not only characterize the event and determine its magnitude or phases of extreme weather event, but also identify its core elements. This is especially crucial in the current era of climate change, where extreme weather events such as floods or thunderstorms are becoming more frequent and unpredictable. By improving our ability to detect and analyse such events, we can enhance our alert systems and take more effective action to mitigate their impact. In this paper we discuss the role of worldwide media observation in extracting and estimating hydrological characteristics of floods, droughts, and heat waves, through the analysis of three case studies, complementing the information provided by traditional monitoring and measurement methods as an earlier but weaker signal. The results presented in this study indicate that the news media signal can be regarded as relatively good proxy of flood dynamics. It can capture the temporal dynamics of the event, and, in some cases, there could be a clear up to 1-day lag between the peak discharge values (i.e., the most extreme flood situation) and the peak in the number of published news. This lag can be attributed to the time needed by journalists to respond to the situation in publishing related news articles covering the event. Our result show that national and regional news can cover well local events. When compared to floods, drought conditions are less explicitly detected from the media. Our result show that European April 2022 drought did not produce much activity in the media while the combination of drought and extreme heat in July 2022 yielded a significant media coverage throughout the Europe. Hence, this can be attributed to the fact that hydrological drought such as low river flows do not attract much attention by the media unless there is a significant impact on the society. Therefore, media signal can be regarded as a relatively good proxy of the hydro-meteorological conditions in case there is a significant impact on the society such as extreme floods causing many casualties and large economic damage.","",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijdrr.2023.104172,"",,
rayyan-224212298,Scaling up benthic primary productivity estimates in a large intertidal estuary using remote sensing,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"As two main primary producers in temperate intertidal regions, seagrass and microphytobenthos (MPB) support estuarine ecosystem functions in multiple ways including stabilizing food webs and regulating sediment resuspension among others. Monitoring estuary productivity at large scales can inform ecosystem scale responses to environmental stressors (climate change, pollution and habitat degradation). Here we use a case study to show how Sentinel-2 data can be used to estimate estuary-wide emerged and submerged gross primary productivity (GPP) on intertidal flats by coupling a new machine learning model to map seagrass and unvegetated habitats with literature-derived photosynthesis-irradiance (P - I) relationships. The model consisted of (1) supervised classification with random forest to delineate seagrass and unvegetated areas and (2) artificial neural network (ANN) regression to predict % seagrass coverage. Our seagrass delineation by supervised classification had an overall accuracy of 0.96, while the ANN regression on seagrass coverage provided high predictive accuracy (R2 = 0.71 and RMSE = 0.11). The estimated GPP showed seagrass contributed slightly more to intertidal benthic productivity than MPB in the case-study estuary over the 3-year study period. This model can be used to predict the response of seagrass and MPB GPP to sea level rise, which shows that the future state may be very sensitive to increased turbidity. For example, by the year 2100, the model shows a sharp decline in productivity with sea level rise, assuming current turbidity trends, (loss of up to 52-53 % for seagrass and 23-45 % for MPB, a function of whether shoreward migration of seagrass is incorporated). However, GPP under conditions of unchanging turbidity (and no seagrass migration), exhibits minimal negative impact of sea level rise (loss of 3 % for seagrass and increase of 29 % for MPB). Therefore, controlling water turbidity might be an efficient solution to maintaining the current GPP as sea level rises.","",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.167389,"",,

Hydrological forecasts are important for operational water management and near-future planning, even more so in light of the increased occurrences of extreme events such as floods and droughts. Having a forecasting framework, which is flexible in terms of input forcings and forecasting locations (local, regional, or national) that can deliver this information in fast and computational efficient manner, is critical. In this study, the suitability of a hybrid forecasting framework, combining data-driven approaches and seasonal (re)forecasting information from dynamical models, to predict hydrological variables was explored. Target variables include discharge and surface water levels for various stations at a national scale, with the Netherlands as the focus. Five different machine learning (ML) models, ranging from simple to more complex and trained on historical observations of discharge, precipitation, evaporation, and seawater levels, were run with seasonal (re)forecast data, including the European Flood Awareness System (EFAS) and ECMWF seasonal forecast system (SEAS5), of these driver variables in a hindcast setting. The results were evaluated using the evaluation metrics, i.e. anomaly correlation coefficient (ACC), continuous ranked probability (skill) score (CRPS and CRPSS), and Brier skill score (BSS), in comparison to a climatological reference hindcast. Aggregating the results of all stations and ML models revealed that the hindcasting framework outperformed the climatological reference forecasts by roughly 60 % for discharge predictions (80 % for surface water level predictions). Skilful prediction for the first lead month, independently of the initialization month, can be made for discharge. The skill extends up to 2–3 months for spring months due to snowmelt dynamic captured in the training phase of the model. Surface water level hindcasts showed similar skill and skilful lead times. While the different ML models showed differences in performance during a testing and training phase using historical observations, running the ML framework in a hindcast setting showed only minor differences between the models, which is attributed to the uncertainty in seasonal forecasts. However, despite being trained on historical observations, the hybrid framework used in this study shows similar skilful predictions to previous large-scale forecasting systems. With our study, we show that a hybrid framework is able to bring location-specific skilful seasonal forecast information with global seasonal forecast inputs. At the same time, our hybrid approach is flexible and fast, and as such, a hybrid framework could be adapted to make it even more interesting to water managers and their needs, for instance, as part of a fast model-predictive control framework.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-501-2023,"",,

The results showed that durum wheat yield mostly varied due to year (rainfall) by 43%, followed by water management × year (23%), year × seeding time (15%), and genotype (7%), with the highest yield (7.15 t ha−1) observed in 2018 (wet year) and the lowest in 2019 (dry year). Across years, not only the rainfall amount but also its distribution during the crop growing season caused yield variability. In low-rainfall years, supplementary irrigation (28–166 mm) increased yield by 2.12–3.27 t ha−1 compared to rainfed conditions. The significant (p < 0.01) year × seeding time × genotype effect on grain yield and WUEs indicates that the response of genotype and seeding time varied with rainfall amount and distribution as the water-limited yield gap in rainfed conditions appeared to be more than 2 t ha−1. In both supplementary irrigated and rainfed systems, the machine learning model showed the effect of different climatic (rainfall and temperature) and management (seeding time, genotype, and irrigation) factors determining yield, yield attributes, and WUEs. The total rainfall remained the most important factor explaining variation in rainfed wheat yield followed by the temperature at flowering, mid- and early-season rainfall, and genotype in order of importance. Similarly, seasonal rainfall was the most important factor explaining variation in grain yield followed by early-season rainfall, days to flowering, temperature at flowering, irrigation amount, seeding time, and genotype in supplementary irrigated durum wheat. Our study clearly shows that yield is highly related to rainfall in rainfed drylands, and the selection of high WUE variety and crop management practices are the key to improving the resilience and sustainability of durum wheat in Morocco and similar production environments in the MENA region.","",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eja.2023.126972,"",,

This study presents an innovative approach for streamflow projections in deep learning (DL) environment by integrating the quantitative Land-Use Land-Cover (LULC) overlaid with flow accumulation values and the various Global Climate Model (GCM) simulated data. Firstly, the Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) model was developed for the streamflow prediction of Greater Pamba River Basin (GPRB) in Kerala, India for 1985 to 2015 period, considering the climatic inputs. Then, the flow accumulation-weighted LULC integration was considered in modelling, which substantially improves the accuracy of streamflow predictions including the extremes of all the three stations, as the model accounts for the geographical variety of land cover types towards the streamflow at the sub-basin outlets. Subsequently, Reliability Ensemble Averaging (REA) technique was used to create an ensemble of three candidate GCM products to illustrate the spectrum of uncertainty associated with climate projections. Future LULC changes are accounted in regional scale based on the sub-basin approach by means of Cellular-Automata Markov Model and used for integrating with the climatic indices. The basin-scale streamflow projection is done under three climate scenarios of SSP126, SSP245 and SSP585 respectively for lowest, moderate and highest emission conditions. This work is a novel approach of integrating quantified LULC with flow accumulation and other climatic inputs in a DL environment against the conventional techniques of hydrological modelling. The DL model can adapt and account for shifting hydrological responses induced by changes in climatic and LULC inputs. The integration of flow accumulation with changes in LULC was successful in capturing the flow dynamics in long-term. It also identifies regions that are more likely to experience increased flooding in the near future under changing climate scenarios and supports decision-making for sustainable water management of the Greater Pamba Basin which was the worst affected region in Kerala during the mega floods of 2018.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/su151914148,"",,
rayyan-224212492,Hybrid Deep Learning and S2S Model for Improved Sub-Seasonal Surface and Root-Zone Soil Moisture Forecasting,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Surface soil moisture (SSM) and root-zone soil moisture (RZSM) are key hydrological variables for the agricultural water cycle and vegetation growth. Accurate SSM and RZSM forecasting at sub-seasonal scales would be valuable for agricultural water management and preparations. Currently, weather model-based soil moisture predictions are subject to large uncertainties due to inaccurate initial conditions and empirical parameterization schemes, while the data-driven machine learning methods have limitations in modeling long-term temporal dependences of SSM and RZSM because of the lack of considerations in the soil water process. Thus, here, we innovatively integrate the model-based soil moisture predictions from a sub-seasonal-to-seasonal (S2S) model into a data-driven stacked deep learning model to construct a hybrid SSM and RZSM forecasting framework. The hybrid forecasting model is evaluated over the Yangtze River Basin and parts of Europe from 1- to 46-day lead times and is compared with four baseline methods, including the support vector regression (SVR), random forest (RF), convolutional long short-term memory (ConvLSTM) and the S2S model. The results indicate substantial skill improvements in the hybrid model relative to baseline models over the two study areas spatiotemporally, in terms of the correlation coefficient, unbiased root mean square error (ubRMSE) and RMSE. The hybrid forecasting model benefits from the long-lead predictive skill from S2S and retains the advantages of data-driven soil moisture memory modeling at short-lead scales, which account for the superiority of hybrid forecasting. Overall, the developed hybrid model is promising for improved sub-seasonal SSM and RZSM forecasting over global and local areas.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/rs15133410,"",,

Due to the rapid changes in technology and upsurge in chemical usage, pollutant alterations turn out to be more drastic with respect to space and time. Research on the trace metals in river water is quite limited in Malaysia, probably due to their ppb-level existence and the need for special handling techniques. Hence, the aim of this study is to forecast heavy metals concentration in Kuantan River waters using a collective of 10 years (2007 – 2016) dataset of heavy metals that provided by the Department of Environment, Malaysia. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was used to compute the data, which showed that As, Cr, Fe, Zn and Cd explain 67.3% of the total variance through three principal components. For ANN computation, those significant metals extracted from rotating PCA was selected and used in ANN model. The developed approaches were trained and tested using 80% and 20% of the data, respectively. Then, the coefficient of determination (R2) was executed to calculate the model performance. Out of five metals, only As shown acceptable R2 for ANN models with 0.8690 and 0.8088 for training and testing, respectively, probably due to the model’s limitation. Generally, this study illustrates the usefulness of PCA and ANN for analysis and interpretation of complex data sets and understanding the temporal and spatial variations in the Kuantan River for effective river water management.","",https://doi.org/10.26480/wcm.02.2023.122.127,"",,
rayyan-224212548,Early Flood Monitoring and Forecasting System Using a Hybrid Machine Learning-Based Approach,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"The occurrence of flash floods in urban catchments within the Mediterranean climate zone has witnessed a substantial rise due to climate change, underscoring the urgent need for early-warning systems. This paper examines the implementation of an early flood monitoring and forecasting system (EMFS) to predict the critical overflow level of a small urban stream on Lesvos Island, Greece, which has a history of severe flash flood incidents requiring rapid response. The system is supported by a network of telemetric stations that measure meteorological and hydrometric parameters in real time, with a time step accuracy of 15 min. The collected data are fed into the physical Hydrologic Engineering Center’s Hydrologic Modeling System (HEC-HMS), which simulates the stream’s discharge. Considering the HEC-HMS’s estimated outflow and other hydro-meteorological parameters, the EMFS uses long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks to enhance the accuracy of flood prediction. In particular, LSTMs are employed to analyze the real-time data from the telemetric stations and make multi-step predictions of the critical water level. Hydrological time series data are utilized to train and validate the LSTM models for short-term leading times of 15 min, 30 min, 45 min, and 1 h. By combining the predictions obtained by the HEC-HMS with those of the LSTMs, the EMFS can produce accurate flood forecasts. The results indicate that the proposed methodology yields trustworthy behavior in enhancing the overall resilience of the area against flash floods.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/ijgi12110464,"",,
rayyan-224212562,An integrated approach to water conservation: fuzzy logic assessment of water tariffs in Abu Dhabi Emirate’s residential sector,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract Background Abu Dhabi, a part of the United Arab Emirates, is situated in an arid region where water scarcity is a significant concern. The residential sector in Abu Dhabi consumes a large portion of the available water resources, leading to a critical need for effective water management strategies. This study aims to understand the relationship between water tariffs and water consumption in the residential sector in Abu Dhabi. It employs an integrated fuzzy logic model, a form of artificial intelligence, to assess the impact of water tariffs on water consumption. The model includes variables such as water tariffs, the level of water awareness, the level of water behavior, and the level of technology use. The objective of these variables is to evaluate their impact on the water-saving index, which represents the ratio of daily water consumption per capita in Abu Dhabi to the global average. Results The findings of this study, based on a survey measuring the level of water awareness, behavior, and technology use, revealed a potential strategy for reducing water consumption in Abu Dhabi’s residential sector. It was observed that increasing water tariffs, while maintaining current levels of water awareness, behavior, and technology use, could lead to a reduction in water consumption. However, it was also found that the impact of further tariff increases on water conservation diminishes after a certain threshold, indicating the necessity of a balanced approach in tariff adjustment. Interestingly, the study also highlights that Abu Dhabi residents demonstrate high levels of water behavior and technology use, indicating a positive trend toward water conservation. Conclusions This study emphasizes the importance of increasing water awareness among Abu Dhabi residents as a means to foster sustainable water consumption practices. While water tariffs can contribute to reductions in water consumption, the effects tend to decrease beyond a certain point. Therefore, a comprehensive approach involving water tariffs, increased water awareness, and the adoption of water-saving technologies may be the most effective strategy for water conservation. The insights from this study extend beyond Abu Dhabi and offer valuable guidance for addressing water conservation challenges worldwide. It highlights the importance of adopting a multi-faceted approach in water management, and the potential for such strategies to have international relevance in the pursuit of sustainable water consumption.","",https://doi.org/10.1186/s42269-023-01130-w,"",,
rayyan-224212578,An Advanced Deep Learning model for Predicting Groundwater Level,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract Groundwater level prediction is important for effective water management. Accurately predicting groundwater levels allows decision-makers to make informed decisions about water allocation, groundwater abstraction rates, and groundwater recharge strategies. Groundwater level prediction can also be used to develop more effective drought preparedness plans to mitigate the impact of water scarcity. In this study, we introduce a new model called self-attention (SA) temporal convolutional network (SATCN)-long short term memory neural network (SATCN-LSTM) model to predict groundwater level. The new model combines the advantages of the SATCN model and the LSTM model to overcome the limitations of the LSTM model. The SATCN model uses skip connections and self-attention mechanisms to overcome the vanishing gradient problem of the LSTM model, identify relevant and irrelevant data, and capture short-, and long-term dependencies of time series data. The new model was used to predict GWL in a large basin. Meteorological data were used to predict GWL. The SATCN-LSTM model outperformed the other models. The SATCN-LSTM model had the lowest mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.06, followed by the self-attention (SA) temporal convolutional network (SATCN) model with an MAE of 0.09. The SALSTM model had an MAE of 0.12, while the TCN-LSTM, TCN, and LSTM models had MAEs of 0.14, 0.15, and 0.17, respectively. The SATCN-LSTM model had the lowest root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.08, followed by SATCN with an RMSE of 0.11. The results of the SATCN-LSTM model provide valuable insights into the dynamics of groundwater systems.

Accurate streamflow forecasting is essential in developing water resource systems that are both technically and economically efficient. This study tested several machine learning techniques to estimate monthly streamflow data in the Hunza River Basin, Pakistan, using streamflow, precipitation, and air temperature data between 1985 and 2013. The techniques tested included adaptive boosting (AB), gradient boosting (GB), random forest (RF), and K-nearest neighbors (KNN). The models were developed using river discharge as the target variable, while air temperature and precipitation as the input variables. The model's performance was assessed via four statistical performance indicators namely root mean square error (RMSE), mean square error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and coefficient of determination (R2). The results obtained for RMSE, MSE, MAE, and R2 using AB, GB, RF, and KNN techniques are (16.8, 281, 6.53, and 0.998), (95.1, 9,047, 61.5, and 0.921), (126.8, 16,078, 74.6, and 0.859), and (219.9, 48,356, 146.3, and 0.775), respectively.

Owing to its significant influence on catchment hydrological responses, it can be utilized as an indicator of floods and droughts to aid early warning systems. This study aimed to develop a field‐scale method to estimate SM using parametric and machine learning‐based methods to compare whether advanced artificial intelligence methods can give similar results as traditional methods. Considering this, monthly observed SM data (from the top 10 cm), environmental covariates, and remotely sensed data from March 2019 to July 2021 for the Cathedral Peak Research Catchments VI and IX in South Africa were obtained. From the 241 observations obtained across 12 sites, 160 (∼66%) were used for model training, while the remaining 81 (∼34%) were used for model testing. Employing 10‐fold cross‐validation, the individual machine learning models (viz., support vector machine [SVM], random forest (RF), k‐nearest neighbor, classification and regression trees [Rpart], and generalized linear model) displayed a satisfactory performance ( R 2 = 0.52–0.79; root mean square error = 3.79–5.80). In the validation phase, the RF model displayed a superior performance, followed by the SVM. Subsequent SM estimation using the hybrid model produced satisfactory results in training ( R 2 = 0.90) and testing ( R 2 = 0.45).

The main findings of this review are as follows: (1) the scientific landscape is predominantly shaped by institutions from the USA and China; (2) the journal Agricultural Water Management emerged as the most prolific, with the highest number of publications and total citations; (3) a broad range of topics within ETc research were identified, with a notable emphasis on remote sensing-related subjects; (4) strategic coordination mapping revealed that ETc and reference evapotranspiration (ETo) remains an underdeveloped area of study; (5) climate change and machine learning emerged as key topics of significant scientific concern. The results suggest a need for enhanced institutional collaborations and expanded research investigations, particularly in regions grappling with agricultural water scarcity. Furthermore, research investigations should focus on ETc and ETo to fill existing knowledge gaps and advance both theoretical understanding and practical applications. Future studies should aim to contribute to the understanding of the impacts of climate change on ETc by leveraging machine learning techniques and enhancing our understanding of crop water requirements and their application in irrigation management, while also ensuring continuous updates to the existing body of knowledge to meet future challenges.","",https://doi.org/10.36253/ijam-2175,"",,
rayyan-224212670,Key factors for quantitative precipitation nowcasting using ground weather radar data based on deep learning,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract. Quantitative precipitation nowcasting (QPN) can help to reduce the enormous socioeconomic damage caused by extreme weather. The QPN has been a challenging topic due to rapid atmospheric variability. Recent QPN studies have proposed data-driven models using deep learning (DL) and ground weather radar. Previous studies have primarily focused on developing DL models, but other factors for DL-QPN have not been thoroughly investigated. This study examined four critical factors in DL-QPN, focusing on their impact on forecasting performance. These factors are the deep learning model (U-Net, as well as a convolutional long short-term memory, or ConvLSTM), input past sequence length (1, 2, or 3 h), loss function (mean squared error, MSE, or balanced MSE, BMSE), and ensemble aggregation. A total of 24 schemes were designed to measure the effects of each factor using weather radar data from South Korea with a maximum lead time of 2 h. A long-term evaluation was conducted for the summers of 2020–2022 from an operational perspective, and a heavy rainfall event was analyzed to examine an extreme case. In both evaluations, U-Net outperformed ConvLSTM in overall accuracy metrics. For the critical success index (CSI), MSE loss yielded better results for both models in the weak intensity range (≤ 5 mm h−1), whereas BMSE loss was more effective for heavier precipitation. There was a small trend where a longer input time (3 h) gave better results in terms of MSE and BMSE, but this effect was less significant than other factors. The ensemble by averaging results of using MSE and BMSE losses provided balanced performance across all aspects, suggesting a potential strategy to improve skill scores when implemented with optimal weights for each member. All DL-QPN schemes exhibited problems with underestimation and overestimation when trained by MSE and BMSE losses, respectively. All DL models produced blurry results as the lead time increased, while the non-DL model retained detail in prediction.

Accurate predictions of environmental controls on ecosystem photosynthesis are essential for understanding the impacts of climate change and extreme events on the carbon cycle and the provisioning of ecosystem services. Using time-series measurements of ecosystem fluxes paired with measurements of meteorological variables from a network of globally distributed sites and remotely sensed vegetation indices, we train a recurrent deep neural network (Long-Short-Term Memory, LSTM), a simple deep neural network (DNN), and a mechanistic, theory-based photosynthesis model with the aim to predict ecosystem gross primary production (GPP). We test these models' ability to spatially and temporally generalise across a wide range of environmental conditions. Both neural network models outperform the theory-based model considering leave-site-out cross-validation (LSOCV). The LSTM model performs best and achieves a mean R2 of 0.78 across sites in the LSOCV and an average R2 of 0.82 across relatively moist temperate and boreal sites. This suggests that recurrent deep neural networks provide a basis for robust data-driven ecosystem photosynthesis modelling in respective biomes. However, limits to global model upscaling are identified using cross-validation by vegetation types and by continents. In particular, our model performance is weakest at relatively arid sites where unknown vegetation exposure to water limitation limits model reliability.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-1826,"",,

Therefore, their conservation and restoration are of fundamental importance for sustainable development. This study used a deep learning model for groundwater level prediction to evaluate a wetland restoration project implemented in the Kushiro Wetland in Japan. The Kushiro Wetland had been degraded due to river improvement work. However, in 2010, a wetland restoration project was carried out to restore the meandering river channel, and a decade has passed since its completion. In this study, the wetland restoration project was evaluated by comparing the response of the groundwater level using a model that reproduced physical conditions with different characteristics before and after the restoration. At first, a deep learning model was created to predict groundwater levels pre- and post-restoration of a meandering river channel using observation data. Long short-term memory (LSTM) was used as the deep learning model. The most important aspect of this study was that LSTM was trained for each of the pre- and post-restoration periods when the hydrological and geological characteristics changed due to the river channel’s restoration. The trained LSTM model achieved high performance with a prediction error of the groundwater levels within 0.162 m at all observation points. Next, the LSTM models trained with the observation data of the post-restoration period were applied to evaluate the effectiveness of the meandering channel restoration. The results indicated that the meandering channel restoration improved hydrological processes in groundwater levels, i.e., their rainfall response and average groundwater water levels. Furthermore, the variable importance analysis of the explanatory variables in the LSTM model showed that river discharge and precipitation significantly contributed to groundwater level recovery in the Kushiro Wetland. These results indicated that the LSTM model could learn the differences in hydrological and geological characteristics’ changes due to channel restoration to groundwater levels. Furthermore, LSTM is a data-driven deep learning model, and by learning hydrological and geological conditions to identify factors that may affect groundwater levels, LSTM has the potential to become a powerful analysis method that can be used for environmental management and conservation issues.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/w15061115,"",,

Additionally, climate change impacts combined with changes in agricultural water use can affect groundwater dynamics. Increased irrigation demand and decreased summer precipitation can lower groundwater levels, impacting crop production.

rayyan-224212847,Real-Time Urban Flood Forecasting: Application of Hybrid Modelling Using Both Physically based and Data-Driven models,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Today, urban flood forecasting is modelled well by hydrologists through physically based models in which different weather data, characteristics of catchments and streams/conduits are used as inputs to provide water level in UDS or water depth of surface runoff [1]. However, continuous access to these data can be challenging and demanding for model calibration or real-time applications that result in lack of providing accurate forecasting [2]. Alternatively, data-driven models can be used in hydrology and data sciences to provide high-speed, less data demanding, and more accuracy for especially short-term water level/depth of urban flooding [3]. However, these models can be inaccurate when new situations, especially new climate change based extreme events, occurred because these models are unable to understand and be adapted with different physical and hydrological situation of catchments [4]. Therefore, while both approaches are well-explored in simulating rainfall-runoff relationship over the urban catchments of interest, coupling these models sound promising and worth investigating in real-time applications of flood warning systems.The present study critically investigates the applications of real-time hybrid models in which physically based and data-driven models are coupled together as integrated platform to take advantages of each type of modelling. The results show three different approaches have been highlighted in this area: (1) using physically-based models to provided up-to-date input data for machine-learning based modelling, (2) applying data-mining techniques to extract the rainfall-runoff features that are used for physically-based models, particularly different types of storm water management model, (3) error bias adjustment or interpolation of forecasts by using both physically-based and data-drive modelling.Results also indicate that the first approach have been usually expressed when input database faces missing data problem, high value uncertainty or highly impacted by climate-related extreme events. This approach was also used for small-scale but dense city area without flexibility in surface lands or underground modifications. On the other hand, the second approach have been presented where big database are available and data screening are required. Furthermore, this modelling approach is more appropriate for high variability and high coverage catchment areas. Finally, the last modelling approach outperforms other approaches in covering both quality and quantity of data resources. However, integration of interpolation and bias adjustment of individual models still have remains as open case than should be more tested in the future.References[1] Zounemat-Kermani, M., Matta, E., Cominola, A., Xia, X., Zhang, Q., Liang, Q., Hinkelmann, R.

rayyan-224212931,A Systematic Review of Methods for Investigating Climate Change Impacts on Water-Energy-Food Nexus,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract Water, energy and food are important for human survival and sustainable development. With climate change, investigating climate change impacts on Water-Energy-Food nexus has been a topic of growing interest in recent years. However, there is a lack of a systematic review of the current state and methodologies of Water-Energy-Food nexus studies under climate change. Here, we review research articles investigating climate change impacts on Water-Food, Water-Energy and Water-Energy-Food nexus over last seven years. The existing methods and tools, spatial scales, and future climate scenarios setting in these articles are summarised and analysed. We found that the analyses methods could be divided into four categories (physics-based modelling, statistical methods, supervised learning and operation optimisation), among them, physics-based modelling accounts for the largest proportion. The reviewed studies cover a range of scales from site scale to global, with most studies focusing on the regional scale. Models used for small to middle scale are mainly related to hydrology and water resource, while large-scale modelling is based on interdisciplinary models. Future climate scenarios setting include emission scenarios and global warming scenarios based on Global Climate Models (GCMs). A number of future research challenges have been identified. These include spatial scale and resolution, internal physical mechanism, application of novel artificial intelligence models, extreme climate events, potential competition in nexus systems as well as data and model uncertainty.","",https://doi.org/10.1007/s11269-023-03659-x,"",,
rayyan-224212939,A New Approach to Predict Tributary Phosphorus Loads Using Machine Learning– and Physics-Based Modeling Systems,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract Tributary phosphorus (P) loads are one of the main drivers of eutrophication problems in freshwater lakes. Being able to predict P loads can aid in understanding subsequent load patterns and elucidate potential degraded water quality conditions in downstream surface waters. We demonstrate the development and performance of an integrated multimedia modeling system that uses machine learning (ML) to assess and predict monthly total P (TP) and dissolved reactive P (DRP) loads. Meteorological variables from the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model, hydrologic variables from the Variable Infiltration Capacity model, and agricultural management practice variables from the Environmental Policy Integrated Climate agroecosystem model are utilized to train the ML models to predict P loads. Our study presents a new modeling methodology using as testbeds the Maumee, Sandusky, Portage, and Raisin watersheds, which discharge into Lake Erie and contribute to significant P loads to the lake. Two models were built, one for TP loads using 10 environmental variables and one for DRP loads using nine environmental variables. Both models ranked streamflow as the most important predictive variable. In comparison with observations, TP and DRP loads were predicted very well temporally and spatially. Modeling results of TP loads are within the ranges of those obtained from other studies and on some occasions more accurate. Modeling results of DRP loads exceed performance measures from other studies. We explore the ability of both ML-based models to further improve as more data become available over time. This integrated multimedia approach is recommended for studying other freshwater systems and water quality variables using available decadal data from physics-based model simulations.","",https://doi.org/10.1175/aies-d-22-0049.1,"",,

However, the task is difficult due to the dynamic nature and limited data of water systems. Highly interconnected water systems can significantly affect hydrometric forecasting. Consequently, it is crucial to develop models that represent the relationships between other system components. In recent years, numerous hydrological applications have been studied, including streamflow prediction, flood forecasting, and water quality prediction. Existing methods are unable to model the influence of adjacent regions between pairs of variables. In this paper, we propose a spatiotemporal forecasting model that augments the hidden state in Graph Convolution Recurrent Neural Network (GCRN) encoder-decoder using an efficient version of the attention mechanism. The attention layer allows the decoder to access different parts of the input sequence selectively. Since water systems are interconnected and the connectivity information between the stations is implicit, the proposed model leverages a graph learning module to extract a sparse graph adjacency matrix adaptively based on the data. Spatiotemporal forecasting relies on historical data. In some regions, however, historical data may be limited or incomplete, making it difficult to accurately predict future water conditions. Further, we present a new benchmark dataset of water flow from a network of Canadian stations on rivers, streams, and lakes. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed model TransGlow significantly outperforms baseline methods by a wide margin.","",https://doi.org/10.1109/icmla58977.2023.00092,"",,
rayyan-224212978,IWRAM: A hybrid model for irrigation water demand forecasting to quantify the impacts of climate change,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"The phenomenon of climate change exerts a substantial influence on the water consumption patterns of agricultural crops, thereby affecting the overall demand for irrigation water and regional water security. The quantitative assessment of future changes in irrigation water requirements has great importance for long-term water resource planning and the water-energy-food-ecosystem nexus. This work employed a comprehensive approach (IWRAM) by integrating many models and techniques, including a global climate model (CanESM2), a statistical downscaling model (SDSM), a bias correction technique (QTM), a temperature-based crop phenology method (GDD), and deep learning technology (LSTM), in order to assess the potential impact of climate change on irrigation water demand. Therein, the QTM is utilized for the purpose of bias correction for the CanESM2-SDSMed daily precipitation data. Additionally, the LSTM is implemented to forecast ETo using the CanESM2-SDSMed daily temperature data. The findings from the case study conducted in the Jinghuiqu irrigation area (JIA) indicate that the application of bias correction techniques resulted in notable enhancements in the frequency distribution of predicted precipitation data. Consequently, this led to a more coherent relationship between historical observed data and anticipated future data, aligning them more closely with natural patterns. The deep learning technique exhibited a strong degree of concordance, suggesting its exceptional capacity for modeling daily reference evapotranspiration. By using the IWRAM model, relatively accurate predictions were made for future precipitation, temperature, crop evapotranspiration, and effective precipitation. Consequently, an estimation was made regarding the anticipated need for irrigation water in JIA. These results highlighted that JIA total irrigation water demand (or net irrigation water demand) will increase by 121 mm (net irrigation water: 189 mm) and 119 mm (net irrigation water: 187 mm) in the year 2050 under RCP 2.6 and 8.5 scenarios, respectively. Climate change could potentially affect the seasonal distribution of precipitation. Therefore, it is crucial for the authorities in JIA to not only take into account the overall irrigation water requirement but also give priority to the water requirements of each stage of crop growth.","",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2023.108643,"",,

Utilizing data‐driven models that harness deep learning (DL) techniques has emerged as an attractive and effective approach to water level prediction. This paper proposed an innovative data‐driven methodology using DL network architectures of Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), Long Short‐Term Memory (LSTM), and Bidirectional Long‐Short Term Memory (Bi‐LSTM) to predict the water level at the Le Thuy station in the Kien Giang River. These models were implemented and validated based on hourly rainfall and water level observations at meteo‐hydrological stations. Three combinations of input variables with different time leads and time lags were established to evaluate the forecast capability of three proposed models by using five metrics, that is, R 2 , MAE, RMSE, Max Error Value, and Max Error Time. The results revealed that the LSTM model outperformed the Bi‐LSTM and GRU models, when water level and rainfall observations for one‐time lag at three stations were used to predict the water level at the Le Thuy station with 1‐h time lead, with the five metrics registering at 0.999; 3.6 cm; 2.6 cm; 12.9 cm; and −1 h, respectively.","",https://doi.org/10.1002/rvr2.63,"",,

This method assesses persistence and allows for combinatorial probability estimations such as initial and transitional probabilities. The hydrologic data was generated ( in-situ ) and received from Uttarakhand Jal Vidut Nigam Limited (UJVNL), and meteorological data was acquired from NASA's archives MERRA-2 product. A total of sixteen years (2005-2020) of data was used to foresee daily precipitation from 2020 to 2022. Precipitation data for 2021 and 2022 were also retrieved from MERRA-2 products and utilized as observed and forecast values for daily precipitation throughout the monsoon season, which runs from July to September. Markov Chain and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) findings for 2020, 2021, and 2022 were observed and anticipated values for daily rainfall during the monsoon season between July and September. According to test findings, the artificial intelligence technique cannot anticipate future regional meteorological formations; the correlation coefficient R 2 is around 0.12. According to the randomly verified precipitation data findings, the Markov Chain model has a success rate of 79.17 percent.

rayyan-224213249,Real-Time Retrieval of Daily Soil Moisture Using IMERG and GK2A Satellite Images with NWP and Topographic Data: A Machine Learning Approach for South Korea,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Soil moisture (SM) is an indicator of the moisture status of the land surface, which is useful for monitoring extreme weather events. Representative global SM datasets include the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP), the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS), and the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Reanalysis 5 (ERA5), but due to their low spatial resolutions, none of these datasets well describe SM changes in local areas, and they tend to have a low accuracy. Machine learning (ML)-based SM predictions have demonstrated high accuracy, but obtaining semi-real-time SM information remains challenging, and the dependence of the validation accuracy on the data sampling method used, such as random or yearly sampling, has led to uncertainties. In this study, we aimed to develop an ML-based model for real-time SM estimation that can capture local-scale variabilities in SM and have reliable accuracy, regardless of the sampling method. This study was conducted in South Korea, and satellite image data, numerical weather prediction (NWP) data, and topographic data provided within one day were used as the input data. For SM modeling, 13 input variables affecting the surface SM status were selected: 10- and 20-day cumulative standardized precipitation indexes (SPI10 and SPI20), a normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), downward shortwave radiation (DSR), air temperature (Tair), land surface temperature (LST), soil temperature (Tsoil), relative humidity (RH), latent heat flux (LE), slope, elevation, topographic ruggedness index (TRI), and aspect. Then, SM models based on random forest (RF) and automated machine learning (AutoML) were constructed, trained, and validated using random sampling and leave-one-year-out (LOYO) cross-validation. The RF- and AutoML-based SM models had significantly high accuracy rates based on comparisons with in situ SM (mean absolute error (MAE) = 2.212–4.132%; mean bias error (MBE) = −0.110–0.136%; root mean square error (RMSE) = 3.186–5.384%; correlation coefficient (CC) = 0.732–0.913), while the AutoML-based SM model tended to have a higher accuracy than the RF-based SM model, regardless of the data sampling method used. In addition, when compared to in situ SM data, the SM models demonstrated the highest accuracy, outperforming both GLDAS and ERA5 SM data and well representing changes in the dryness/wetness of the land surface according to meteorological events (heatwave, drought, and rainfall). The SM models proposed in this study can, thus, offer semi-real-time SM data, aiding in the monitoring of moisture changes in the land surface, as well as short-term meteorological disasters, like flash droughts or floods.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/rs15174168,"",,
rayyan-224213282,Improving Seasonal Prediction of Summer Precipitation in the Middle–Lower Reaches of the Yangtze River Using a TU-Net Deep Learning Approach,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract The two-step U-Net model (TU-Net) contains a western North Pacific subtropical high (WNPSH) prediction model and a precipitation prediction model fed by the WNPSH predictions, oceanic heat content, and surface temperature. The data-driven forecast model provides improved 4-month lead predictions of the WNPSH and precipitation in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River (MLYR), which has important implications for water resources management and precipitation-related disaster prevention in China. When compared with five state-of-the-art dynamical climate models including the Climate Forecast System of Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology (NUIST-CFS1.0) and four models participating in the North American Multi-Model Ensemble (NMME) project, the TU-Net produces comparable skills in forecasting 4-month lead geopotential height and winds at the 500- and 850-hPa levels. For the 4-month lead prediction of precipitation over the MLYR region, the TU-Net has the best correlation scores and mean latitude-weighted RMSE in each summer month and in boreal summer [June–August (JJA)], and pattern correlation coefficient scores are slightly lower than the dynamical models only in June and JJA. In addition, the results show that the constructed TU-Net is also superior to most of the dynamical models in predicting 2-m air temperature in the MLYR region at a 4-month lead. Thus, the deep learning-based TU-Net model can provide a rapid and inexpensive way to improve the seasonal prediction of summer precipitation and 2-m air temperature over the MLYR region. Significance Statement The purpose of this study is to examine the seasonal predictive skill of the western North Pacific subtropical high anomalies and summer rainfall anomalies over the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River region by means of deep learning methods. Our deep learning model provides a rapid and inexpensive way to improve the seasonal prediction of summer precipitation as well as 2-m air temperature.

rayyan-224213302,Dataset on the global distribution of shallow groundwater,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Shallow groundwater (GW), defined as the water table of unconfined or perched aquifers that is near enough to the land surface to influence the vadose zone and the surface soil moisture, impacts land surface water, energy, and carbon cycles by providing additional moisture to the root zone via capillary fluxes. Although the interactions of shallow GW and the terrestrial land surface are widely recognized, incorporating shallow GW into the land surface, climate, and agroecosystem models is not yet possible due to the lack of groundwater data. Groundwater systems are affected by various factors, including climate, land use/land cover, ecosystems, GW extractions, and lithology. Although GW wells are the most direct and accurate way of monitoring water table depths at point scales, upscaling GW levels from point scale to areal or regional scale poses significant challenges. Here, we provide high spatiotemporal resolution global maps of the terrestrial land surface areas influenced by shallow GW from mid-2015 to 2021 (a separate NetCDF file for each year) in a 9 km spatial and daily temporal resolution. We derived this data from NASA's Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission spaceborne soil moisture observations with a temporal resolution of 3 days and approximately 9 km grid resolution. This spatial scale corresponds to SMAP's ""Equal Area Scalable Earth"" (EASE) grids. The central assumption is that the monthly moving average of soil moisture observations and their coefficient of variation are sensitive to shallow GW regardless of the prevailing climate. We process the Level-2 enhanced passive soil moisture SMAP (SPL2SMP_E) product to detect shallow GW signals. The presence of shallow GW data is calculated by an ensemble machine learning model, which is trained using simulations from a variably saturated soil moisture flow model (Hydrus-1D). The simulations span various climates, soil textures, and lower boundary conditions. The spatiotemporal distribution of shallow GW data based on SMAP soil moisture observations is provided for the first time with this dataset. The data are of value in a wide variety of applications. The most direct use is in climate and land surface models as lower boundary conditions or as a diagnostic tool to verify model results. Some other applications may include flood risk analyses and regulation, identifying geotechnical issues such as shallow GW-triggered liquefaction, global food security, ecosystem services, watershed management, crop yield, vegetation health, water storage trends, and tracking mosquito-borne diseases by identifying wetlands, among other applications.","",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dib.2023.108973,"",,
rayyan-224213323,Graph Transformer Network for Flood Forecasting with Heterogeneous Covariates,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Floods can be very destructive causing heavy damage to life, property, and livelihoods. Global climate change and the consequent sea-level rise have increased the occurrence of extreme weather events, resulting in elevated and frequent flood risk. Therefore, accurate and timely flood forecasting in coastal river systems is critical to facilitate good flood management. However, the computational tools currently used are either slow or inaccurate. In this paper, we propose a Flood prediction tool using Graph Transformer Network (FloodGTN) for river systems. More specifically, FloodGTN learns the spatio-temporal dependencies of water levels at different monitoring stations using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and an LSTM. It is currently implemented to consider external covariates such as rainfall, tide, and the settings of hydraulic structures (e.g., outflows of dams, gates, pumps, etc.) along the river. We use a Transformer to learn the attention given to external covariates in computing water levels. We apply the FloodGTN tool to data from the South Florida Water Management District, which manages a coastal area prone to frequent storms and hurricanes. Experimental results show that FloodGTN outperforms the physics-based model (HEC-RAS) by achieving higher accuracy with 70% improvement while speeding up run times by at least 500x.","",https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2310.07631,"",,

In Thailand, an agricultural country, the number of rain gauge stations is relatively small compared to the country’s area. To deal with the problem, many spatial interpolation methods have been adopted. They utilized only geological data from stations with known rainfall values to estimate values at other locations. Characteristics of clouds captured in infrared satellite images could be used to infer rainfall. In this study, infrared satellite satellite images from every 30 minutes were integrated with geological data to spatially estimate daily precipitation. Under different assumptions, we proposed three estimation models, namely AveragedIR-ANN, IRs-ANN, and LocalIRs-CNN. All three models used artificial neural networks as the estimator. The AveragedIR-ANN model used the average of 48 black body temperature (TBB) values to present IR images at the target location as an input. Meanwhile, the 48 TBB values were directly fed into the IRs-ANN. Not only the TBB values at the target location, but the LocalIRs-CNN also used the TBB values around the target location as inputs. Experiments were performed on 24 days per year between 2016 and 2019 with multiple tries. The results show that the LocalIRs-CNN outperformed by minimizing the median highest root mean square error.

Although Penman-Monteith is more successful than others and is the most frequently used technique to calculate water footprint it requires a significant number of meteorological parameters at different spatio-temporal scales, sometimes inaccessible in many of the poor nations. Due to the greatest performance in the non-linear relations of inputs and output of the model, the complex hydrological phenomena are frequently described in machine learning models. Therefore, the objective of this research is to 1) develop and compare between the four-machine learning: Support Vector Regression (SVR), Random Forest (RF), Extreme Gradient Boost (XGB) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) over three potato’s governorates (Al-Gharbia, Al-Dakahlia, and Al-Beheira) in Delta, Egypt and 2) select the best model in the best combination of climate input variables, which achieves high precision and low error in forecasting potato blue WF. The available variables for this study are maximum temperature (T max ), minimum temperature (T min ), average temperature (T ave ), wind speed (WS), relative humidity (RH), precipitation (P), vapor pressure deficit (VPD), solar radiation (SR), Sown area (SA), and crop coefficient (Kc) to predict potato BWFP during (1990–2016). Six scenarios of input variables were used to test the weight of each variable in for four applied models. Different statistical indicators have been used to assess applied model performance (NSE, RMSE, MAE, MBE, A, R2, SI and MAPE). The results demonstrated that Sc5 with the XGB and ANN model is competent enough to evaluate BWF only if there are just vapor pressure deficit, precipitation, solar radiation, crop coefficient data followed by Sc1.

In addition, cost-effective design, and operation of flood control measures such as smart UDS require highly accurate rainfall predictions across the catchment area, i.e., intensity and duration [2]. Furthermore, sufficient lead time is needed to activate the control mechanisms on the UDS without affecting the accuracy of the predictions. It seems that the emerging use of satellite precipitation products (SPPs) is promising for obtaining predictions with longer lead times [3]. Hence, more exploration of potential runoff predictions by using SPPs is worth investigating to achieve a more accurate and longer lead time.This study employs a type of SPPs i.e., global precipitation measurement-integrated multi-satellite retrieval product (GPM-IMERG) to predict rainfall-runoff duration, peak and volume, as well as changes in flow over the course of the event at 30-minute intervals. In order to train and validate the machine learning model, the data from GPM-IMERG V06 was merged with ground data from the catchment precipitation gauge and flow sensor. The methodology is demonstrated by its application to the rainfall-runoff modelling of a real-world small urban sub-catchment area and its performance is evaluated by comparing it with the runoff predictions from physically based simulation models [4].Results show that while using SPPs solely can provide accurate predictions, significant improvement can be obtained when this data is integrated with ground monitoring data. The model output can be utilised for better design, planning and management of UDS technologies as flood control tools and consequently real-time operation of UDS in urban flooding.[1] Ferrans, P., Torres, M., Temprano, J., S&amp;#225;nchez, J., (2022).

rayyan-224213393,Implementation of Rainfall Forecasting using ANN,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Prediction of rainfall is essential for many sectors, including flood mitigation, disaster prevention, agriculture production, and water resource management. Rain forecasts are used to warn of natural disasters such as floods or to plan planting activities to improve the quality of crop yields. An accurate rainfall prediction remains a challenging task due to the uncertainty of natural phenomena considering that rainfall is a non-linear and dynamic process. Various climatic variables such as temperature, relative humidity, wind speed and direction, are among those that affect the dynamic process of rainfall. This study suggests a machine learning technique based on Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model to forecast rainfall by using two-years historical local rain rate and others meteorological data. Evaluation metrics such as mean absolute error, root mean square error, and correlation coefficient, are used to evaluate model’s performance.

Understanding the temporal and spatial trends of terraced-field areas (TRAs) and the factors underlying them in the YRB is essential for improving land use, conserving water resources, promoting biodiversity, and preserving cultural heritage. In this study, we employed machine learning on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform to obtain spatial distribution images of TRAs from 1990 to 2020 using Landsat 5 (1990–2010) and Landsat 8 (2015–2020) remote sensing data. The GeoDa software (software version number is 1.20.0.) platform was used for spatial autocorrelation analysis, revealing distinct spatial clustering patterns. Mixed linear and random forest models were constructed to identify the driving force factors behind TRA changes. The research findings reveal that TRAs were primarily concentrated in the upper and middle reaches of the YRB, encompassing provinces such as Shaanxi, Shanxi, Qinghai, and Gansu, with areas exceeding 40,000 km2, whereas other provinces had TRAs of less than 30,000 km2 in total. The TRAs exhibited a relatively stable trend, with provinces such as Gansu, Qinghai, and Shaanxi showing an overall upward trajectory. Conversely, Shanxi and Inner Mongolia demonstrated an overall declining trend. When compared with other provinces, the variations in TRAs in Ningxia, Shandong, Sichuan, and Henan appeared to be more stable. The linear mixed model (LMM) revealed that farmland, shrubs, and grassland had significant positive effects on the TRAs, explaining 41.6% of the variance.

rayyan-224213442,Impact of climate change on groundwater levels in the Iberian Peninsula,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Groundwater represents a strategic freshwater resource for multiple sectors, including drinking water, agriculture production, and ecosystem services. The Mediterranean Basin is a well-known water-scarce region that is increasingly relying on groundwater use, especially during drought periods. Many areas in the Mediterranean region are already facing water stress due to increasing demand and limited resources. Climate change is likely to exacerbate these issues, as it is expected to lead to more frequent and severe drought conditions in some areas as well as irregular rainfall in others. Due to the growing availability of data and computational processing capabilities nowadays, deep learning models are seeing an increase in popularity. In this study, we attempted to create 92 location-specific Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models in wells spatially distributed over the Iberian Peninsula to estimate groundwater levels until the end of the century. Our models use monthly precipitation and temperature data as input variables. Specifically, we considered cumulative precipitation for 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, and 36 months to account for the recharge time lag between precipitation and groundwater changes. Once trained using historical precipitation and temperature records, the CNNs were applied to assess the influence of climate change on groundwater levels. For future climate projections, an ensemble of six combinations of distinct General Circulation Models (GCMs) and Regional Climate Models (RCMs) was considered under two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs): the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. Our preliminary results revealed a more consistent decline in groundwater levels in the southwest region of the Iberian Peninsula under the RCP8.5 scenario, while a general more constant groundwater level under the RCP4.5 scenario has been detected towards the end of the century. Detailed results of this study will be shared and discussed during the event.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu23-12968,"",,

The majority of the world's freshwater resources have inadequate monitoring of critical environmental variables needed for management. Yet, the need to have widespread predictions of hydrological variables such as river flow and water quality has become increasingly urgent due to climate and land use change over the past decades, and their associated impacts on water resources. Modern machine learning methods increasingly outperform their process-based and empirical model counterparts for hydrologic time series prediction with their ability to extract information from large, diverse data sets. We review relevant state-of-the art applications of machine learning for streamflow, water quality, and other water resources prediction and discuss opportunities to improve the use of machine learning with emerging methods for incorporating watershed characteristics into deep learning models, transfer learning, and incorporating process knowledge into machine learning models. The analysis here suggests most prior efforts have been focused on deep learning learning frameworks built on many sites for predictions at daily time scales in the United States, but that comparisons between different classes of machine learning methods are few and inadequate. We identify several open questions for time series predictions in unmonitored sites that include incorporating dynamic inputs and site characteristics, mechanistic understanding and spatial context, and explainable AI techniques in modern machine learning frameworks.","",https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2308.09766,"",,
rayyan-224213563,Assessing land degradation neutrality in data scarce semi-arid drylands agroecosystems to improve land resources management: a case study in Matabeleland North Province of Zimbabwe.,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Semi-arid agroecosystems have a crucial function in supplying food and ecosystem services. However, these ecosystems are under severe threat due to land degradation. To enhance our understanding of environmental trends and their causes and to identify more sustainable land management techniques, it is important to track land degradation in space and time. This study uses land cover, soil organic carbon, and land productivity dynamics maps to evaluate land degradation neutrality (as per Sustainable Development Goal 15, indicator 15.3.1). In this regard, we employed the trends.earth tool in QGIS 3.3, utilising the European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative (ESA CCI) classified LULC maps for 1992, 2000, 2010, and 2020 to assess land degradation. Additionally, we predicted 2050 LULC maps using the MOLUSCE plugin in QGIS, which integrates an artificial neural network (ANN) in cellular automata (CA) modeling (CA-ANN) based on the 2015 LULC map and independent variables such as digital elevation model (DEM) and slope. Our results indicated a significant decrease in bare areas (71%) and an increase in settlements (built-up areas) (163%) between 1992 and 2020. Furthermore, the predicted land cover map shows a significant increase in bare land (238%) and settlements (72%), accompanied by a decrease in water bodies (23%) and forested areas (3.5%). In terms of land degradation, approximately 26.46% of the province exhibited degraded land, accounting for approximately 20,146.35 km , while approximately 59.55% (45,337.84 km ) of the land remained stable. Land cover conversions, particularly from forests to grasslands and settlements, are among the potential drivers of land degradation. Identifying land cover transitions and assessing land degradation is paramount for effective monitoring and planning. By understanding these dynamics, targeted interventions can be developed to mitigate land degradation and promote sustainable land use practices in semi-arid agroecosystems.","",https://doi.org/10.22541/au.168982569.96810532/v1,"",,
rayyan-224213578,Reducing uncertainty in extreme weather vegetation stress modeling using satellite-model approach at high resolution,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Vegetation is a key driver for carbon uptake from the atmosphere to the land. Yet episodes of plant stress and mortality associated with drought and heat waves due to persistent lack of precipitation have been reported over the last decades and are expected to increase under ongoing climate change. It is presumed that climate-related vegetation stress results in progressively worsening plant health and rising mortality. However, the mechanisms driving such mortality are still up for debate because of the complex interconnections between the processes and the factors. Monitoring plant stress and mortality at the ecosystem level remains challenging to quantify since long-term, tree-individual, reliable observations are uncertain. For this reason, here we adapted a satellite-model approach to work on regional forests, before up scaling the results to the global forest.In Belgium, the Wallonia region is covered by 30% forests which are the highest among all the three regions. While with the consecutive recent extreme events especially the droughts and heat waves of 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2022 caused water stress and bark beetle attack. According to the 35 years (1985-2022), land use land cover change extracted by LANDSAT 5,7, and 8 satellites, there is no significant change in forest land in Wallonia, Belgium. Meanwhile, in the current years 2021-2022, there is a decrease in the tree canopy with intensive forest management due to tree plant stress. On the other hand, in Wallonia, the forest is distributed in a significant patch of broadleaves, coniferous leaves, and mixed forest. However, we found that consecutive drought events cause water stress on specific plant species like Norway spruce which are in vulnerable states. For example: in a mixed forest when bark beetle or Scolytinae attacked the spruce tree it is more attracted to the other trees and in this consequence tree species &amp;#8211;like &amp;#160;birch and oak &amp;#8211;are now also in premature death or deteriorating tree health. In this study, we are using a high spatial resolution (25cm) remote sensing images using Artificial Intelligence and machine learning techniques to find out pixel-based individual plant stress or mortality. In addition, the high-resolution tree mortality extracted data will be used to calibrate CARAIB dynamic vegetation model and analyze the impact of extreme events on trees during the recent past and the future (until 2070). In conclusion, from this study, we plan to improve our model regarding the implementation of plant traits and species mortality aspects towards a better prediction of forest tree species' vulnerability to future extreme weather events.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu23-15565,"",,

Effective management of the drought and resource allocation become more important in these situations, especially in regions like Latur district where agriculture is strongly dependent on these resources and water scarcity problems continue.Using historical climatic data that includes variables like temperature and precipitation, the suggested methodology calculates the Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) for the Latur region.

rayyan-224213653,Insights from the first winter weather observations near Mount Everest's summit,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"The highest reaches of our planet experience some of the most extreme weather on Earth and hold very significant supplies of freshwater for communities downstream. However, we know very little of the meteorological detail about this high-altitude frontier. We address this here with new winter weather observations from the upper reaches of Mount Everest (2019–2021). We show that substantial sublimation rates are possible, with losses up to 2.5mm day−1. Wind chill plunging to −83°C and frostbite possible in less than one minute also attest to the severe cold stress facing mountaineers attempting winter ascents of this most iconic peak. Reaching up to 8849m above mean sea level (asl), the upper slopes of Mount Everest provide one of the most climatically extreme environments on the planet. It is also an environment likely to be warming rapidly, due to the tendency for temperature increases to amplify at greater elevations in the troposphere under climate change (Pepin et al., 2015). However, our understanding of high-altitude climates has been severely limited by an understandable lack of basic in situ observations (Matthews, 2020a). The logistical demands associated with climbing to such heights challenges the initial installation of automatic weather stations (AWSs). Those AWSs which do get deployed must then withstand extreme cold and severe winds if they are to remain operational. Mountain regions that are hardest to reach, at those times of year when the weather is most extreme, have therefore been monitored least, meaning winter conditions on the planet's highest peaks remain largely a mystery. Through necessity, insights have mostly been taken from relatively coarse reanalysis data (Moore and Semple, 2011; Matthews et al., 2021). Not only does this monitoring gap represent a technical blind spot in the understanding of our planet's climate envelope, but the practical impacts for society may also be substantial. For example, the mountains of the Hindu Kush Himalayan region store the largest mass of ice outside the poles (Bolch et al., 2012), and the ongoing retreat is a major concern for regional freshwater security (Immerzeel et al., 2020; Nie et al., 2021). The potential future losses inferred by modelling studies is, therefore, of much relevance for resource management and hazard planning (Huss and Hock, 2018). However, such outlooks are underpinned by an understanding of glacier–climate interactions that is biased towards more accessible regions and seasons in the same way the observations are. Temperature index models, for example, are widely used for glacier mass balance projections (Hock et al., 2019), but they appear unsuited to capture the important role of sublimation, which is amplified at higher altitudes (Stigter et al., 2018; Litt et al., 2019) and in the winter season (Wagnon et al., 2013). In this short article, we address the issues raised above by assessing the first observations from winter recorded by the one of the world's highest weather station networks on Mount Everest. We include the most-constrained estimate yet of air temperatures and cold stress on the summit, and we consider mechanisms of mass loss from the highest glacier on Earth. We use meteorological data from the weather station network installed by the 2019 National Geographic and Rolex Everest Expedition, which is described by Matthews et al. (2020a,b) and summarised in Table 1. We summarise the weather across the full (>4500m) elevational range using simple descriptive statistics. For the summit – which sits ~400m above the Balcony AWS – we estimate air temperatures and cold stress using the temperature lapse rate and the assumption that wind speeds are the same as at the South Col AWS (which is situated in a less sheltered location than the Balcony). The temperature lapse rates were calculated as a linear regression of hourly temperature at the AWSs against elevation (cf. Immerzeel et al., 2014; Heynen et al., 2016), after first smoothing all temperatures with a running 24-hour mean to reduce the impact of solar heating which may affect measurements during brief spells of light winds (Matthews et al., 2020a,b). To explore point surface mass balance during the winter of the world's highest glacier (South Col Glacier, hereafter the SCG), we use data from the South Col AWS (7945m asl). This station was the highest of the network installed in 2019 that was equipped with all the sensors required to resolve the surface energy balance (SEB) and is separated from the SCG by a horizontal distance of only a few hundred metres. We use COSIPY (the COupled Snowpack and Ice surface energy and mass balance model in PYthon: Sauter & Schneider, 2015) to infer the SEB for the SCG, with mass input via snowfall estimated from the precipitation recorded at Phortse (3810m asl). We set all COSIPY model parameters (e.g. roughness lengths) as in Potocki et al. (2022). We fill brief periods of missing data at the South Col with ERA5 reanalysis data (Hersbach et al., 2020) downscaled to the AWS using machine learning (see Potocki et al., 2022 for details). The initial snow depth (0.94m) for the COSIPY simulation model was taken from the 1km2 Sentinel-1 snow depth product for 13 May 2019 (Lievens et al., 2019), which is 10 days prior to the installation of the AWS (and the beginning of the COSIPY model run). Given the highly variable topography, the accuracy of this Sentinel product for the SCG is questionable; however, it is the highest resolution snow depth product, and preliminary analysis (not shown) indicated low sensitivity to initial snow depth in the COSIPY simulations. Winter stands distinct from the other seasons, with air temperatures and insolation plunging to their lowest values and wind speeds reaching their peak (Figure 1). The highest (3s) gust recorded by the network (66ms−1; not shown) was indeed recorded at the South Col during January 2020 – immediately before the wind sensors went offline. The change to colder, conditions at the onset of winter generally magnifies with elevation, as the lapse rate steepens in this season meaning air temperatures fall more rapidly with height (Figures 1a and e). Relative humidity is noteworthy in winter because of its very high variability at synoptic timescales (Figure 1a). Although not quite as pronounced, the same high-frequency variance is evident in the air temperatures (Figure 1b). We attribute this wintertime peak in transitions between warmer, moister air masses and cooler, drier circulations, to the arrival of the Subtropical Jet over the Himalaya. The passage of waves in this westerly flow drives the variation in air mass character; and wind speeds peak when the jet axis crosses Everest (Matthews et al., 2020b). The elevation-enhanced drop in air temperature with the arrival of winter, combined with the amplification of winds, compound to generate extreme conditions of profound cold stress for the summit. The mean winter WCT is −61.2°C (Table 2), whilst the lowest daily mean observed during the period of observation was −77°C (on 31 December 2020) (Figure 2). The individual hour with the lowest WCT on the other hand reached −83°C, when the mean wind speed was 36ms−1 and the temperature was −48°C (in 19 January 2020). The FFT tells a similar story, indicating a mean exposure time in winter of less than two minutes before uncovered skin would be at high risk of frostbite (Table 2). Values much less than one minute in Figure 2 underscore the dangers of exposing skin for even the briefest of periods on Mount Everest during extreme winter cold events. We note that the monthly mean WCT and FFT shown in Figure 2 are in reasonably good agreement with the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) reanalysis-based assessment by Moore and Semple (2011), but we find a less severe cold hazard during the monsoon. Owing to the high levels of insolation, our COSIPY simulation suggests that the net shortwave radiation flux is the largest energy source for the SCG (Figure 3a). Most of this energy is then dispersed by the net longwave radiation, followed by the turbulent (sensible and latent) heat fluxes, and finally energy for melting. The model results indicate that some meltwater may be generated in the monsoon season, despite the air temperature staying well below 0°C. The majority of the ablation, however, is as sublimation (Figure 3), with cumulative losses of 539mm w.e. in between 23 May 2019 and 30 June 2021: more than nine times the amount of surface melt during the same period (60mm w.e.) (Figure 3b). Temporal variations in sublimation show that although the highest mean rate is in the post-monsoon (October–November), peak rates occur in the winter season, reaching up to 2.5mm w.e. day−1. To put such losses into context, integrating the total sublimation from the colder, windier, and drier months of the post-monsoon and winter (Figure 3d) through the ~150 days of that period indicates that 0.28m w.e. could be ablated during that time. If that figure is also representative of conditions at the summit, and if snow density there is in the region of 300–500kgm−3, then the peak could be expected to 'shrink' by up to 0.5–0.9m during this period (assuming no input of snow via precipitation or wind re-distribution). Given this potential for mass loss, and the considerable efforts expended in measuring the height of Mount Everest (Adhikari and Slater, 2020), we suggest that examining inter-annual variability in the mass balance of the summit could be an interesting direction for future research. In this short article, we provided the first assessment of wintertime weather measured by in situ stations on Mount Everest. The assessment highlighted the extent of the severe cold hazard on the upper mountain in more detail than has previously been possible, identifying hourly wind chills as low as −83°C and daily means reaching −77°C. This cold hazard amplifies more with the onset of winter than at lower elevations because the lapse rate also steepens in this season. Our investigation also reveals that the combination of strong winds and low relative humidity during the wintertime is enough to drive significant sublimation (2.5mm w.e. day−1) on the upper reaches of Mount Everest. Quantifying mass loss from such previously unexplored seasons and locations is important to understand the impact of climate change on water resources in High Mountain Asia. In the case of Mount Everest, it has additional symbolic value, as it helps illuminate the extent to which the height of Earth's highest mountain is subject to change. Exploring this more could be an interesting avenue for future research. The authors declare no conflicts of interest.","",https://doi.org/10.1002/wea.4374,"",,

rayyan-224213710,Mapping water quality in complex estuarine and coastal waters using deep learning models and high-resolution satellite imagery,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Large-scale spatiotemporal water quality assessments are made possible with the advent of remote sensing imagery.Reliable remote water quality parameter estimations require sufficient in-situ measurements of surface water's Inherent Optical Properties (IOPs).These include absorption and backscattering coefficients of optically active dissolved and particulate matter that must match with corresponding remotely sensed Reflectance (Rrs).In most cases, there is a severe lack of overlapping matchups needed for effective calibration and validation of Total Suspended Sediment (TSS) and Dissolved Organic Carbon (DOC).These parameters are critical to understanding water quality degradation dynamics and developing sustainable water management practices.In addition, coastal regions are the most complex, with the interplay of land, river and ocean currents affecting the flow of largely turbid discharge.The optically complex discharge results in a non-linear mapping of the reflectance spectrum to the water quality parameters, further compounded by the anthropogenic contribution of sediment concentrations, natural events such as heavy rainfall, and their combination.Thus, we must quantify the non-linear relationship between Rrs and water quality parameters in different climate domains.In this study, we have numerically determined Rrs using radiative transfer modelling based on observed IOP measurements across the Hawkesbury, Hunter, and Clarence estuarine and coastal waters in New South Wales, Australia, during March and July 2022.We consider a 10% error in observed TSS/DOC measurements and simulate an ensemble of Rrs -ap/acdom/bbp -TSS/DOC dataset for each of the 56 stations where the field survey was conducted.The resulting dataset of ~4 million records provides a sample space big enough for developing Deep Learning -Neural Network (DL -NN) based architectures on a cloud-based Open Data Cube (ODC) environment.Deep Multi-Layer Perceptron (DMLP) NN and Convolution NN (CNN) were tested, with DMLP exhibiting lower inherent errors of 3% compared to 4.5% of CNNs.The DMLP NN was then spectrally convolved with available atmospheric-corrected Landsat-8 multi-spectral (443, 483, 561 and 655nm) imagery over the said basins for 2022 and compared with the regional spectral library-based i-SAM (Cherukuru et al., 2021;Sanwlani et al., 2022) derived TSS and DOC maps.This work compares existing regional models and explores the potential of DL NN in mapping TSS and DOC in complex coastal waters.The DMLP model exhibits improved computational efficiency and can be employed to map the sediment loads due to flood events across these river basins.","",https://doi.org/10.36334/modsim.2023.unnithan,"",,

The residential sector in Abu Dhabi consumes a large portion of the available water resources, leading to a critical need for effective water management strategies. This study aims to understand the relationship between water tariffs and water consumption in the residential sector in Abu Dhabi. It employs an integrated fuzzy logic model, a form of artificial intelligence, to assess the impact of water tariffs on water consumption. The model includes variables such as water tariffs, the level of water awareness, the level of water behavior, and the level of technology use. The objective of these variables is to evaluate their impact on the water-saving index, which represents the ratio of daily water consumption per capita in Abu Dhabi to the global average. Results : The findings of this study, based on a survey measuring the level of water awareness, behavior, and technology use, revealed a potential strategy for reducing water consumption in Abu Dhabi's residential sector. It was observed that increasing water tariffs, while maintaining current levels of water awareness, behavior, and technology use, could lead to a reduction in water consumption. However, it was also found that the impact of further tariff increases on water conservation diminishes after a certain threshold, indicating the necessity of a balanced approach in tariff adjustment. Interestingly, the study also highlights that Abu Dhabi residents demonstrate high levels of water behavior and technology use, indicating a positive trend toward water conservation. Conclusions : This study emphasizes the importance of increasing water awareness among Abu Dhabi residents as a means to foster sustainable water consumption practices. While water tariffs can contribute to reductions in water consumption, the effects tend to decrease beyond a certain point. Therefore, a comprehensive approach involving water tariffs, increased water awareness, and the adoption of water-saving technologies may be the most effective strategy for water conservation. The insights from this study extend beyond Abu Dhabi and offer valuable guidance for addressing water conservation challenges worldwide. It highlights the importance of adopting a multi-faceted approach in water management, and the potential for such strategies to have international relevance in the pursuit of sustainable water consumption.","",https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-3243276/v1,"",,
rayyan-224213864,Recent Trends in the Yield-Nutrient-Water Nexus in Morocco,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Climate change is impacting environmental systems including agriculture. In Morocco, declining precipitation and increasing temperatures are negatively impacting crop yields. Consequently, crop yields in Morocco are now dependent on nutrient and water management. Most studies have focused on experimentation through fertilizer application and irrigation without any attention to the intrinsic linear relationships that exist between crop yields, fertilizers, and agricultural water withdrawal. The time series agricultural water withdrawal data were collected from AQUASTAT for the period 1990-2022 while data on nitrogen, phosphorous, and potash fertilizers were collected from FAOSTAT. Yield data for maize, barley, sorghum, and wheat were also collected from FAOSTAT. The data were analyzed using two machine learning models fitted through multiple linear regression. The key results show that for the three fertilizers, phosphates tend to have the strongest impacts and cause changes in crop yield as seen in the context of wheat. When both fertilizers and agricultural water withdrawal are fitted against yield, agricultural water withdrawals tend to have a strong relationship with yields. This work has helped us to identify which crops and management options need to be valorized in terms of increased access to nutrients and water.","",https://doi.org/10.5772/intechopen.112552,"",,

In this paper, we propose a spatiotemporal forecasting model that augments the hidden state in Graph Convolution Recurrent Neural Network (GCRN) encoder-decoder using an efficient version of the attention mechanism. The attention layer allows the decoder to access different parts of the input sequence selectively. Since water systems are interconnected and the connectivity information between the stations is implicit, the proposed model leverages a graph learning module to extract a sparse graph adjacency matrix adaptively based on the data. Spatiotemporal forecasting relies on historical data. In some regions, however, historical data may be limited or incomplete, making it difficult to accurately predict future water conditions. Further, we present a new benchmark dataset of water flow from a network of Canadian stations on rivers, streams, and lakes. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed model TransGlow significantly outperforms baseline methods by a wide margin.","",https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2312.05961,"",,

The conventional methods are limited by their inability to capture the high precipitation variability in time and space. In the present work, a wavelet-based deep learning approach is adopted to forecast precipitation using the lagged monthly rainfall, local climate variables, and global teleconnections such as IOD, PDO, NAO, and Nino 3.4 as predictors. The method was tested and validated over the Krishna River Basin in India. Overall, the forecasting accuracy was higher using the wavelet-based hybrid models than the single-scale models. The proposed multi-scale model was then applied to the different climatic regions of the country, and it was shown that the model could forecast the rainfall at reasonable accuracy for different climate zones of the country.","",https://doi.org/10.20944/preprints202305.1373.v1,"",,

The Pannonian-Carpathian Basin is particularly affected by the increasing frequency of hazardous hydrological events. Agricultural production, which is a highly significant economic sector in the region, is particularly vulnerable to these unfavourable climatic conditions. Changes in precipitation patterns and soil moisture levels can lead to reduced crop yields, while floods can pollute water sources and erode fertile soil. Mapping of Inland Excess Water (IEW), also known as ponding water or waterlogged areas, is crucial for informed decision-making, damage compensation, risk management, and future prevention planning. Remote sensing technology and machine learning have been demonstrated to be valuable tools for the mapping of IEW. The 2014 floods in Southeastern and Central Europe serve as a reminder of the importance of effective flood risk management. This study used a Geographical Information System (GIS) and a Semi-automated Classification Processing (SCP) tool to process high-resolution RapidEye satellite images from the 2014 floods in the Srem region of Serbia. The Spectral Angle Mapping (SAM) classification model was used to produce a map of IEW. The SAM model achieved an overall accuracy of 92.68 %. The study found that IEW affected approximately 2.90 % or 99.59 km² of the territory in Srem. The obtained maps can be used by responsible water management agencies to prevent and control excessive inland water.","",https://doi.org/10.2478/eces-2023-0037,"",,
rayyan-224213963,Simulating Hydrological Extremes for different Warming Levels – combining Large Scale Climate Ensembles with local observation based Machine Learning models,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Climate change has a large influence on the occurrence of extreme hydrological events. In this study we take advantage of two recent developments that allow for more detailed and local estimates of future hydrological extremes. New large climate ensembles (LE) now provide more insight into the occurrence of hydrological extremes as they offer order of magnitude more realizations of the future weather and thus floods and droughts. At the same time recent developments in Machine Learning (ML) based forecasting have enabled scientists to provide this LE information to a local scale relevant to water managers.In this study we combine LE, consisting of 2000 years of global data for scenarios representing present-day, 2 and 3 degrees warmer climate (1), together with a local, observation-based ML model framework for simulating hydrological extremes for the Netherlands (2, 3).We developed a new post-processing approach that allows us to use LE simulation data for local applications based on historical information. We test the application of the post-processing step based on historical simulations, before implementing in the different scenario runs.The discharge simulation results for the different scenarios show a clear seasonal cycle with increased low flow periods (both average duration and number of events) from summer till end of autumn (~45% August-October) and increased high flow periods for early spring (~43% February-April) looking at national scale, with the 3-degree warmer climate scenario showing the highest percentages for both (52.5% and 48.3% respectively). Regional differences can be seen in terms of shifts (low flows occurring earlier in the year) and range (higher/lower percentages). These trends can further be detangled into location specific results, due to the added value provided by the ML setup.We show that by combining the wealth of information from LE and the speed and accuracy of ML models we can advance the state-of-the-art when it comes to modelling and projecting hydrological extremes. The local modelling framework allows to simulate discharge under different climate change scenarios for national, regional and local scale assessments.

rayyan-224214114,Forest management strategies to improve water-related ecosystem services in central Italy,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Forest management can represent a powerful tool to optimise ecosystem services related to water, as water availability is deeply connected with forests and their management. The objective of this study is to improve the understanding of the forest&amp;#8211;water connection, developing a methodology that can explain which forest types and management strategies can increase water availability and flood protection in Casentino Forest National Park (Parco Nazionale delle Foreste Casentinesi). The different forest management types for every species considered in the study are abandoned or unmanaged forest, coppice, coetaneous and non-coetaneous high forest. The Casentino Forest National Park in Central Italy on the Apennine Mountains covers a set of 25 small river basins, which have been chosen as a case study to test a methodology based on hydrological modelling and machine learning tool. First, the Soil Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) has been calibrated and used to model the baseline scenario, evaluating the ecosystem services the forest park provides. The baseline scenario has been built in the SWAT model, characterising the forest-related parameters, such as the leaf area index, the leaf-to-biomass fraction, the biomass of the forest or the canopy storage among others. This information has been retrieved with land use data, such as the Corine Land Cover, available forest technical map and MODIS satellite images. The following step has been the analysis of multiple land use scenarios to understand the potential effect of different forest management on water-related ecosystem services. Nevertheless, the SWAT model is hugely time-consuming in modelling several land use scenarios, as each forest management strategy needs to be described with a new set of parameters and model runs. For this reason, a Support Vector Machine (SVM) learning model has been trained to reproduce the hydrological behaviour of the Park using the &amp;#160;SWAT model outputs for the baseline scenario as a training dataset. The SVM has been validated with a Jack-Knife cross-validation to test its reliability in determining the average annual water yield, runoff, evapotranspiration and percolation in the river basins using the different forest management types as input. Then, the SVM has been used to model a set of 4200 different land use scenarios to understand the type of forest with the higher water yield content or lower surface runoff. The results show that the oldest forests, especially with a prevalence of oaks, have great potential in regulating services, while the coppices contribute more to the provisioning services.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu23-15446,"",,
rayyan-224214277,Event-based Flood Data Imputation for Infilling Missing Data in Real-time Flood Warning Systems,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Real-time flood warning systems as part of digital and innovative non-structural solutions have been widely used to prepare decision makers, operators, and affected population to alleviate socio-economic flooding consequences [1]. Many models have been introduced recently to provide more accurate flood forecasts with longer lead times. However, they rely highly on availability of input data which may contain missing values in measurement for one or more timesteps mainly due to wide range of reasons such as random/systematic errors and blunders. Hence, real-time early warning systems cannot be operated properly unless these missing data are properly infilled [2]. Despite data imputation techniques have been mainly employed in pre-processing step of historical data i.e., models training and validation, they have not been properly elaborated in real-time operation practically [3].This paper aims to propose a new event-based data imputation method for infilling rainfall and water level missing data appearing in real-time operation of flood early warning systems. Event identification is first used to divide the real-time data into the wet or dry weather conditions which then are used for selecting the best strategy of infilling missing data. Imputation decision framework takes advantage of various imputation techniques including t-copula, move-median, and kriging based on external available benchmarks and temporal location of missing data. Proposed methodology is tested in real-world case study of urban drainage system in London, UK. Conventional techniques such as linear regression, kriging, nearest neighbourhood, t-copula, inverse distance, and similar calendar are first compared together and best techniques are then tested with proposed methodology in three real-time scenarios as (1) missing rainfall intensity, (2) missing water level, (3) missing both rainfall and water level. Recurrent neural network model used for flood forecasting and results are demonstrated for the next 3hr-ahead predictions.Results show the proposed method can reduce root mean square error (RMSE) from 55% to 13%, 43% to 12%, and 97% to 17% for the above scenarios, respectively. Furthermore, using external benchmark data resources, i.e. other near rainfall/water level stations, shows very efficient when missing data appears at early steps of rainfall events where selected conventional techniques suffer from predicting rainfall pattern. Finally, when both water level and rainfall intensity were missing, the proposed imputation method can reduce RMSE from 197mm to 117mm (RMSE was originally 100 for no missing data) for 3hr-ahead predictions. Generally, this study shows the proposed imputation method can better infill the missing data, especially those in the flood event by using correlated data in other weather/gauging stations and flexibility in applying different methods.References[1] Piadeh, F., Behzadian, K., Alani, A.M.

In this study, the impact of climate change on the Al-Wala basin was analyzed. This basin is located in the south of the capital of Jordan- Amman, over a long period of time, using different types of satellite images. A new approach of Google Earth Engine (GEE) and machine learning code are used to understand the responses of hydrological process to climate change in the study area. In addition, Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model was used to simulate the hydrological process up to year 2064. Moreover, the Meteorological Research Institute Earth System Model (MRI-ESM2-0) predicted a variation of the water surface area of the dam in the future years and an important fluctuation of the amount of annual rainfall quantity. The amounts of annual rainfall expected to increase and decrease wobbly for several years in the future. Overall the average annual runoff will increase by 10% compared to the baseline scenario. The minimum temperature also is expected to be higher than their rates throughout the year by 0.09<sup>o</sup>- 0.11<sup>o</sup> C; which will increase the evaporation rates with about 0.03%.

rayyan-224214291,Improving the spatial accuracy of extreme tropical cyclone rainfall in ERA5 using deep learning,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Tropical cyclones (TCs) are one of the costliest and deadliest natural disasters due to the combination of their strong winds and induced storm surges and heavy precipitation, which can cause devastating floods. Unfortunately, due to its high spatio-temporal variability, complex underlying physical process, and lack of high-quality observations, precipitation is still one of the most challenging aspects of a TC to model. However, as precipitation is a key forcing variable for hydrological processes acting across multiple space-time scales, accurate precipitation input is crucial for reliable hydrological simulations and forecasts.A popular source of precipitation data is the ERA5 reanalysis dataset, frequently used as input to hydrological models when studying floods. However, ERA5 systematically underestimates TC-induced precipitation compared to MSWEP, a multi-source observational dataset fusing gauge, satellite, and reanalysis-based data, currently one of the most accurate precipitation datasets. Moreover, the spatial distribution of TC-rainfall in ERA5 has large room for improvement.Here, we present a precipitation correction scheme based on U-Net, a popular deep-learning architecture. Rather than only adjusting the per-pixel precipitation values at each timestep of a given TC, we explicitly design our model to also adjust the spatial distribution of the precipitation; to the best of our knowledge, we are the first to do so. The key novelty of our model is a custom-made loss function, based on the combination of the fractions skill score (FSS) and mean absolute error (MAE) metrics. We train and validate the model on 100k time steps (with an 80:20 train:test split) from global TC precipitation events. We show how a U-Net trained with our loss function can reduce the per-pixel MAE of ERA5 precipitation by nearly as much as other state-of-the-art methods, while surpassing them significantly in terms of improved spatial patterns of precipitation. Finally, we discuss how the outputs of our model can be used for future research.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu23-8085,"",,

Better quantification of &amp;#952;crit&amp;#160;is needed for understanding recent dryness trends and improving future projections of climate and water resources, food production, and ecosystem vulnerability. Here we combine systematic satellite observations of the diurnal amplitude of land surface temperature (dLST) and SM during dry-downs, corroborated by in-situ data from flux towers, to generate the first observation-based global map of &amp;#952;crit. We find an average global &amp;#952;crit&amp;#160;of 0.19 m3/m3, with a large gradient ranging from 0.12 m3/m3&amp;#160;in arid ecosystems to 0.26 m3/m3&amp;#160;in humid ecosystems.

The global observed pattern of &amp;#952;crit&amp;#160;reflects plant adaptation to soil available water and atmospheric demand.

Moreover, we show that the annual fraction of days with water stress, when SM stays below &amp;#952;crit, has increased in the past four decades. Our results have key implications for improving the representation of water stress in models and identifying SM tipping points that could result in impaired ecosystem functioning during prolonged dry-downs.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu23-4507,"",,
rayyan-224214398,Root zone soil moisture estimation over China,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Root zone soil moisture (RZSM) refers to the water available to plants.Compared to surface soil moisture, RZSM plays a more crucial role in various applications such as agricultural monitoring, drought and flood forecasting, water supply management, land-atmosphere feedbacks, and the hydrologic response of watersheds.There are three commonly used methods to estimate RZSM.The first method involves in-situ soil moisture sensors.However, field measurements are only representative of a small spatial scale, which limits their applications.The second method is based on surface soil moisture (SSM).Microwave remote sensors are effective for measuring the global distribution of SSM.However, due to the limitation of microwave depth signal penetration, RZSM cannot be obtained based on it.Since SSM is closely related to RZSM through the diffusion process, some methods have been developed to estimate RZSM from SSM.For instance, the exponential filter (EF) method uses a simplified two-layer water balance approach to establish the relationship between SSM and RZSM (Albergel et al., 2008).Data-driven methods use SSM, meteorological data, land surface conditions, and soil properties as drivers to build machine learning models to estimate RZSM.The third method for obtaining RZSM involves modeling approaches that combine climate models or land surface models with data assimilation techniques.RZSM reanalysis data products such as ERA5, MERRA2, and CFSR rely on this method.Similarly, the RZSM products of SMAP level 4 and GLDAS are also model-based.However, large errors usually exist in the RZSM simulations due to uncertainties in model parameters and forcings (Xu).This study first evaluates seven RZSM products, including ERA5, MERRA2, CFSR, SMAP level 4, GLDAS_NOAH2.1,GLDAS_Catchment2.2, and SMOS CATDS Level 4, using 1153 ground sites across China.Then, a data fusion method is developed based on machine learning method to integrate the seven RZSM products to produce a more accurate RZSM dataset.The evaluation results show that MERRA2 and NOAH had the best performance, with MERRA2 better able to capture surplus and deficit soil moisture conditions.The study also revealed that precipitation forcing plays a vital role in improving RZSM simulations.Conversely, ERA5 overestimates RZSM, and SMOS exhibits a dry bias.From the time series variability, all datasets except SMOS can capture the temporal dynamics of RZSM well.Moreover, the accuracy of the RZSM products varies significantly in tropical climate zones.The newly developed dataset is better than a single RZSM product with five-fold cross-validation.This study provides crucial insights for improving land surface and hydrological models in estimating RZSM, and proposes an approach to promoting the accuracy of RZSM estimation by maximizing the utilization of existing RZSM products, which is very helpful in drought management and agricultural production.","",https://doi.org/10.36334/modsim.2023.tian218,"",,

In 2008, the Scientific Surveys came home to where it all started, the University of Illinois, under the umbrella of the Prairie Research Institute with the addition of the Illinois Sustainability and Technology Center and Illinois State Archeological Survey. Together, the Prairie Research Institute has over 800 scientists, technicians, post-docs, research affiliates, visiting scholars, students, and administrative support staff, conducting transformative science that benefits the people, economy, and environment of Illinois, the nation, and the world. From their inception, the Scientific Surveys have always been located on the University of Illinois campus and continues to capitalize on the mutual benefits of collaboration with faculty and staff. The papers presented in this special issue marking the 125th anniversary founding of the ISWS are but a representation of the current contributions and research being conducted by ISWS scientists and colleagues, aiming to demonstrate what Illinois experiences in water resources planning and management under changing conditions, especially changing climate. They build on water supply planning legacy by incorporating future demands and climate uncertainties in Illinois, including the major updating of Illinois precipitation frequency standards. The theme of understanding uncertainties and bias continues in evaluating groundwater static head measurements to understand water-level variability. Of course, projecting climate change impacts is paramount to many water resource issues and authors discuss which climate ensemble approaches produce less uncertain climate model outputs. Nutrient losses in US agricultural lands are an issue not only for loss of crop production but downstream impacts. Winter cover crops have much promise for reducing nitrate, phosphorus, and sediment loads. Authors present possible detrimental impacts on storage volumes for downstream reservoirs in drought years. An Illinois River watershed analysis presents evidence that spatial and temporal shift in phosphorus loading affects recent increases in phosphorus despite point and nonpoint source efforts. The ISWS has long-term datasets which contributed to improved model calibration to capture chloride accumulation in shallow aquifers. Reservoirs serve populations and industry so understanding outflows from them is important for water resource planning and management. Comparing performance of three machine learning models shows promise for simulating reservoir outflow. Finally, colleagues in Illinois and China test a theoretical framework to better understand bivariate return periods of hydrological events, which is important for design criteria of hydraulic structures. The ISWS continues to evolve and adjust research needs, as demonstrated by the first 125 years, and look forward to providing science-based information to societies in the next 125 years.

rayyan-224214557,High-resolution downscaling of CMIP6 Earth system and global climate models using deep learning for Iberia,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract. Deep learning (DL) methods have recently garnered attention from the climate change community for being an innovative approach to downscaling climate variables from Earth system and global climate models (ESGCMs) with horizontal resolutions still too coarse to represent regional- to local-scale phenomena. In the context of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 6 (CMIP6), ESGCM simulations were conducted for the Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) at resolutions ranging from 0.70 to 3.75∘. Here, four convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures were evaluated for their ability to downscale, to a resolution of 0.1∘, seven CMIP6 ESGCMs over the Iberian Peninsula – a known climate change hotspot, due to its increased vulnerability to projected future warming and drying conditions. The study is divided into three stages: (1) evaluating the performance of the four CNN architectures in predicting mean, minimum, and maximum temperatures, as well as daily precipitation, trained using ERA5 data and compared with the Iberia01 observational dataset; (2) downscaling the CMIP6 ESGCMs using the trained CNN architectures and further evaluating the ensemble against Iberia01; and (3) constructing a multi-model ensemble of CNN-based downscaled projections for temperature and precipitation over the Iberian Peninsula at 0.1∘ resolution throughout the 21st century under four Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) scenarios. Upon validation and satisfactory performance evaluation, the DL downscaled projections demonstrate overall agreement with the CMIP6 ESGCM ensemble in magnitude for temperature projections and sign for the projected temperature and precipitation changes. Moreover, the advantages of using a high-resolution DL downscaled ensemble of ESGCM climate projections are evident, offering substantial added value in representing regional climate change over Iberia. Notably, a clear warming trend is observed in Iberia, consistent with previous studies in this area, with projected temperature increases ranging from 2 to 6 ∘C, depending on the climate scenario. Regarding precipitation, robust projected decreases are observed in western and southwestern Iberia, particularly after 2040. These results may offer a new tool for providing regional climate change information for adaptation strategies based on CMIP6 ESGCMs prior to the next phase of the European branch of the Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment (EURO-CORDEX) experiments.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-229-2024,"",,

Accurate ETo prediction is crucial for optimizing irrigation water management. This research aimed to assess the reliability and accuracy of ML algorithms in predicting ETo values. Three ETo calculation methods were employed: Penman-Monteith (PM), Hargreaves (HA), and Blaney-Criddle (BC). The study analyzed ETo and other climate variables using the modified Mann-Kendall test (m-MK) and Theil Sen's slope estimator methods to identify trends. Multiple ML algorithms, including Support Vector Regression (SVR), Random Forest (RF), XGboost, K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Decision Trees (DT), Linear Regression (LR), and Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) were utilized for ETo prediction. The ML algorithms exhibited excellent performance, with coefficients of determination (R2) values ranging from 0.97 to 0.99 for PM, 0.99 for HA, and from 0.91 to 0.92 for BC. The models demonstrated a high value of the Kling-Gupta efficiency (KGE) with low Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) values. Strong correlations between the predicted and calculated daily ETo were observed with R2 values of 0.99, 0.99, and 0.92 for PM, HA, and BC methods, respectively.

The growing demand for agricultural productivity and sustainability in the context of finite water resources and climate change drives the necessity for more efficient water management practices. AI technologies, through automated and precision irrigation systems, AI-based predictive models, and AI-driven water quality monitoring, offer significant improvements in water efficiency and agricultural output. These systems optimize irrigation scheduling based on real-time data, enhance the precision of water application, and ensure water quality, thus supporting sustainable agricultural practices. However, the implementation of AI in water management is not without challenges. Technical difficulties in adapting AI to diverse agricultural environments, data privacy and security concerns, ethical considerations, and barriers to adoption among small-scale farmers are critical issues that need addressing. This study addresses both the transformative impacts and the inherent challenges of integrating AI technologies. Furthermore, the review identifies a gap in research regarding AI’s adaptability to variable climates and its integration with socio-economic data, suggesting that future studies focus on these areas. Policy recommendations are also discussed, emphasizing the need for developing standards and best practices, increasing funding and incentives for AI research, promoting training and capacity building, and establishing robust regulatory frameworks for data management. By tackling these challenges and leveraging AI’s full potential, water management in agriculture can be significantly improved, leading to enhanced global water security and sustainability in farming practices. The review concludes that while AI presents a promising future for agricultural water management, strategic and thoughtful approaches are required to overcome obstacles and fully realize the benefits of this technology.","",https://doi.org/10.9734/jsrr/2024/v30i62068,"",,

However, human activities and climate change have significantly degraded the wetland ecosystem in recent decades in the YRD. Therefore, an understanding of the land use modifications is essential for the efficient management and preservation of ecosystems in this region. This study utilized time series of remote sensing data and the extreme gradient boosting method to generate land use maps of the YRD from 2000 to 2020. Several methods, including transition matrix, land use dynamic degree, and standard deviation ellipse, were employed to explore the characteristics of land use transitions. The results underscore significant spatial variations in land use over the past two decades. The most rapid increase was observed in built-up area, followed by terrestrial water and tidal flats, while unutilized land experienced the fastest decrease, followed by forest–grassland. The spatial distribution patterns of agricultural land, built-up area, terrestrial water, and forest–grassland demonstrated stronger directionality compared to other land use types. The wetlands have expanded in size and improved in structure. Unutilized land has been converted into artificial wetlands comprising ponds, reservoirs, salt ponds, shrimp and crab ponds, and natural wetlands featuring mudflats and forest–grassland. The wetland conservation efforts after 2008 have proven very effective, playing a positive role in ecological and environmental preservation, as well as in regional sustainable development.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/rs16111946,"",,
rayyan-224214609,Developing a New ANN Model to Estimate Daily Actual Evapotranspiration Using Limited Climatic Data and Remote Sensing Techniques for Sustainable Water Management,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Accurate estimations of actual evapotranspiration (ETa) are essential to various environmental issues. Artificial intelligence-based models are a promising alternative to the most common direct ETa estimation techniques and indirect methods by remote sensing (RS)-based surface energy balance models. Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are proven to be suitable for predicting reference evapotranspiration (ETo) and ETa based on RS data. This study aims to develop a methodology based on ANNs for estimating daily ETa values using NDVI and land surface temperature, coupled with limited site-specific climatic variables in a large irrigation catchment. The ANN model has been applied to the two different scenarios. Data from only the 38 days of satellite overpass dates was selected in Scenario I, while in Scenario II all datasets, i.e., the 769-day data were used. An irrigation scheme, located in the Mediterranean region of Turkiye, was selected, and a total of 38 Landsat images and local climatic data collected in 2021 and 2022 were used in the ANN model. The ETa results by the ANN model for Scenarios I and II showed that the R2 values for training (0.79 and 0.86), testing (0.75 and 0.81), and the entire dataset (0.76 and 0.84) were all remarkably high. Moreover, the results of the new ANN model in two scenarios showed an acceptable agreement with ETa-METRIC values.

This review examines 69 studies applying DL to forecasting tasks within climate modeling and weather prediction, disaster management, air quality modeling, hydrological modeling, renewable energy forecasting, oceanography, and environmental monitoring. We summarize commonly used DL architectures for spatiotemporal forecasting in ESS, key technical innovations, and the latest advancements in spatiotemporal predictive applications. While DL architectures have proven capable of handling spatiotemporal data, challenges remain in tackling the complexities specific to ESS, such as complex spatiotemporal data, scale dependencies, model interpretability, and integration of physical knowledge. Recent innovations demonstrate growing efforts to integrate physical knowledge, improve model explainability, adapt DL architectures for domain-specific needs, and quantify uncertainties. Finally, this review highlights key future directions, including (1) developing more interpretable hybrid models that synergize DL and traditional physical approaches, (2) extending model generalizability through techniques like domain adaptation and transfer learning, and (3) advancing methods for uncertainty quantification and missing data handling.","",https://doi.org/10.1080/17538947.2024.2391952,"",,

To improve LULCC prediction, this study proposes the use of a random forest regression (RFR) model, in comparison with logistic regression–cellular automata (LR-CA) and artificial neural network–cellular automata (ANN-CA), for the prediction of LULCC (2019–2030) in the Gaborone dam catchment (Botswana). RFR is proposed as it is able to capture the existing and potential interactions between the LULC intensity and their nonlinear interactions with the change-driving factors. For LULCC forecasting, the driving factors comprised physiographic variables (elevation, slope and aspect) and proximity-neighborhood factors (distances to water bodies, roads and urban areas). In simulating the historical LULC (1986–2019) at 5-year time steps, RFR outperformed ANN-CA and LR-CA models with respective percentage accuracies of 84.9%, 62.1% and 60.7%. Using the RFR model, the predicted LULCCs were determined as vegetation (−8.9%), bare soil (+8.9%), built-up (+2.49%) and cropland (−2.8%), with water bodies exhibiting insignificant change. The correlation between land use (built-up areas) and water depicted an increasing population against decreasing dam water capacity. The study approach has the potential for deriving the catchment land–water nexus, which can aid in the formulation of sustainable catchment monitoring and development strategies.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/su16041699,"",,

The current approach to pipe management for water utilities in Sweden is mainly reactive; leaks are repaired when detected, sometimes with large costs if the leakage is extensive and critical. With this study, we want to focus on proactive pipe network management by using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model to estimate the probability of leakage in water pipes. The ANN model was trained on leaks that occurred over 10 years. A comparison with leaks reported after the training shows that the model succeeds in identifying groups of pipes with a higher leakage frequency. Evaluation of both new and historical leaks in four different water pipe networks in Sweden showed that a higher prediction value from the ANN model was linked to a higher occurrence of leakage. This indicates that the ANN model succeeds in identifying some of the combinations of attributes that lead to leakage. An evaluation of the input attributes in the ANN model found that the most important attributes for leakage prediction were pipe material, pipe age, adjacent problems on the pipe stretch, pipe length and pipe dimension.","",https://doi.org/10.2166/ws.2024.104,"",,

Continuous control of the water stage can help build an early warning indicator of floods along rivers and streams. Hence, forecasting river stages up to several days in advance is very important and constitutes a challenging task. Over the past few decades, the use of machine learning paradigm to investigate complex hydrological systems has gained significant importance, and forecasting river stage is one of the promising areas of investigations. Traditional in situ measurements, which are sometime restricted by the existing of several handicaps especially in terms of regular access to any points alongside the streams and rivers, can be overpassed by the use of modeling approaches. For more accurate forecasting of river stages, we suggest a new modeling framework based on machine learning. A hybrid forecasting approach was developed by combining machine learning techniques, namely random forest regression (RFR), bootstrap aggregating (Bagging), adaptive boosting (AdaBoost), and artificial neural network (ANN), with empirical mode decomposition (EMD) to provide a robust forecasting model. The singles models were first applied using only the river stage data without preprocessing, and in the following step, the data were decomposed into several intrinsic mode functions (IMF), which were then used as new input variables. According to the obtained results, the proposed models showed improved results compared to the standard RFR without EMD for which, the error performances metrics were drastically reduced, and the correlation index was increased remarkably and great changes in models’ performances have taken place. The RFR_EMD, Bagging_EMD, and AdaBoost_EMD were less accurate than the ANN_EMD model, which had higher R≈0.974, NSE≈0.949, RMSE≈0.330 and MAE≈0.175 values. While the RFR_EMD and the Bagging_EMD were relatively equal and exhibited the same accuracies higher than the AdaBoost_EMD, the superiority of the ANN_EMD was obvious. The proposed model shows the potential for combining signal decomposition with machine learning, which can serve as a basis for new insights into river stage forecasting.","",https://doi.org/10.1007/s13201-024-02103-8,"",,

This study proposes a novel combination of artificial intelligence and process-based models to construct a flood early warning system (FEWS) for estuarine regions. Using streamflow and rainfall data, a deep learning model with long short-term memory layers was used to forecast the river discharge at the fluvial boundary of an estuary. Afterwards, a hydrodynamic process-based model was used to simulate water levels in the estuary. The river discharge predictors were trained using different forecasting windows varying from 3 h to 36 h to assess the relationship between the time window and accuracy. The insertion of attention layers into the network architecture was evaluated to enhance forecasting capacity. The FEWS was implemented in the Douro River Estuary, a densely urbanised flood-prone area in northern Portugal. The results demonstrated that the Douro Estuary FEWS is reliable for discharges up to 5000 m 3 /s, with predictions made 36 h in advance.

Although Penman-Monteith is more successful than other methods and it is the most frequently used technique to calculate water footprint, however, it requires a significant number of meteorological parameters at different spatio-temporal scales, which are sometimes inaccessible in many of the developing countries such as Egypt. Machine learning models are widely used to represent complicated phenomena because of their high performance in the non-linear relations of inputs and outputs. Therefore, the objectives of this research were to (1) develop and compare four machine learning models: support vector regression (SVR), random forest (RF), extreme gradient boost (XGB), and artificial neural network (ANN) over three potato governorates (Al-Gharbia, Al-Dakahlia, and Al-Beheira) in the Nile Delta of Egypt and (2) select the best model in the best combination of climate input variables. The available variables used for this study were maximum temperature ( T max ), minimum temperature ( T min ), average temperature ( T ave ), wind speed (WS), relative humidity (RH), precipitation (P), vapor pressure deficit (VPD), solar radiation (SR), sown area (SA), and crop coefficient (Kc) to predict the potato blue water footprint (BWF) during 1990–2016. Six scenarios (Sc1–Sc6) of input variables were used to test the weight of each variable in four applied models. The results demonstrated that Sc5 with the XGB and ANN model gave the most promising results to predict BWF in this arid region based on vapor pressure deficit, precipitation, solar radiation, crop coefficient data, followed by Sc1.

Globally, flooding is one of the most devastating natural disasters. Flood risk mitigation relies heavily on accurate and consistent streamflow forecasts. Pakistan Upper Indus Basin (UIB) is most vulnerable to flooding. Floods have become more frequent in recent decades. UIB can be divided into sub-regions due to its landscape variability, and its collective impact is most prominent in the Massam region. UIB hydrological and meteorological station observations have been used to study seasonal hydro-meteorological variations. To predict flooding, this study proposes a hybrid model combining artificial neural networks as multi-layer perceptron (MLPs) in feed-forward mode, along with empirical mode decomposition (EMD).

Current methods to evaluate water quality involve the collection of water samples for subsequent laboratory analysis. Although these technologies offer precise measurements for a specific location and time, they are expensive, time-consuming, and do not provide the continuous, temporal, or spatial conditions of water quality that are required for managing, assessing, and monitoring water quality. In order to calculate the water quality, the water quality index is modeled using artificial neural network models that incorporate feedforward neural network backpropagation neural networks and radial neural networks. The water quality index of Malaysia’s Klang River was determined by training the artificial network using six major sub-quality parameters. Compared to the current method, the artificial neural network simplifies and expedites the computation of the water quality index. The artificial neural network method could provide a significant saving in terms of money and time while offering a robust assessment of water quality. The proposed method could also be used as an early warning system for pollution of water bodies. The best artificial neural network was the feedforward neural network with one hidden layer containing 5 neurons. Furthermore, conventional approaches for calculating the water quality index rely on empirical equations, often introducing a high degree of approximation and uncertainty into the results.

It is highly productive agriculturally, but highly vulnerable to hydroclimatic shocks. A principal means of improving systemwide water management flexibility is strategic land fallowing. To date, however, land fallowing is sporadic, ephemeral, and unpredictable. Understanding patterns and drivers of land fallowing would allow resource managers to better plan for water allocation to cities, farms, and ecosystems. The inability to accurately anticipate the distribution of fallow land hampers the optimization of resource use, thereby affecting both the agricultural economy and regional water management. Thus, forecasting fallow land would allow for more optimum agricultural productivity and water delivery, particularly to vulnerable communities and ecosystems. To address this issue, this study compares state-of-the-art machine learning models with deep learning methods using a rich dataset that includes satellite images, weather patterns, soil properties, historical land use information, and other pertinent geospatial data. We employ an advanced ensemble of machine learning algorithms, i.e., Random Forest (RF), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and Support Vector Machines (SVM), for forecasting fallow land. Additionally, we investigate the use of Convolutional and Recurrent Neural Networks (like ConvLSTM, CNN-LSTM, and GAN) to take advantage of the spatial and temporal relationships contained in the data. Our preliminary findings suggest that deep learning models, with their capacity to capture intricate spatial and temporal correlations within the data, may perform better than more conventional machine learning techniques. As a result, these deep learning models could help water managers, policymakers, and researchers make more precise forecasts about the distribution of fallow land, leading to more optimal use of water resources and agricultural output. The results of this study can not only offer insights for California water managers and policymakers, but also enable practical plans for more optimal resource allocation, sustainable agricultural land use, and long-term water security.

Open-source software like QGIS and spatial data like Landsat also play a significant role in this endeavour. The primary objective of this study was to enhance the accuracy of modeling LULC changes in wetland areas. Six ML models: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naive Bayes (NB), Decision Tree (DT), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Random Forest (RF), and K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) were used for LULC image classification of Landsat 8 (2020 image) and Landsat 5 (1990, 2000, and 2010 images) in QGIS. Four models: SVM, NB, DT, and KNN, performed better than the other models. Consequently, The Quad (4) hybrid model was created by fusing the maps from these four models with the highest performance. Results revealed that the fusion of the four classified maps of the SVM, NB, DT, and KNN (Quad hybrid model) showcased superior performance compared to the individual models with Kappa Index scores of 0.87, 0.72, 0.84 and 0.87 for the years 1990, 2000, 2010 and 2020, respectively. The analysis of the LULC changes from 1990 to 2020 showed a yearly decline of -1.17%, -1.01%, and -0.12% in forest, grassland, and water body coverage, respectively. In contrast, built-up areas and cropland increased at rates of 1.70% and 2.70%, respectively. This study underscores the consistent growth of cropland and built-up areas from 1990 to 2020, alongside the reduction of forest cover and grassland. Although the water body experienced a gradual decrease over this period, the decline was minimal. Long-term monitoring will be essential for evaluating the success of interventions, guiding conservation efforts, mitigating negative impacts on the wetland ecosystem, and determining whether the reduction in water bodies is a sustained trend or a short-term phenomenon.","",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envc.2024.100866,"",,

By the Employment of these two features, the research developed an expert system of an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model designed with optimal parameters, neurons, and hidden layers to classify the presence and pinpoint the location of leaks within the water test rig. The effectiveness of the current approach is quantitatively evaluated using F1-scores and accuracy metrics. A robust capability for both detecting and localizing leaks under varying conditions was established with a highest accuracy and F1-score of 86.5 % and 86.2 %, respectively.

In the Kurdistan Region of Iraq (KRI), there is a good amount of precipitation, surface water, and groundwater, but the main issue is mismanagement of those sources. Rainfall is one of the major sources of water resources in KRI. In order to manage the available water resources and prevent natural disasters such as floods and droughts, there is a need for reliable models for forecasting rainfall. The current study focuses on developing a hybrid model, namely seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average combined with an artificial neural network (SARIMA-ANN) for forecasting monthly rainfall at Sulaymaniyah City for the duration of 1938–2012. For comparison purposes, a conventional machine learning model, namely artificial neural networks (ANN) has been applied on the same data. Two different statistical measurements, namely, root mean square error (RMSE) and coefficient of determination (R2), have been used to check the accuracy of the proposed models. According to the findings, SARIMA-ANN outperformed ANN with RMSE = 11.5, RMSE = 51.002, R2 = 0.98, R2 = 0.43, respectively.

However, the global demand for water is increasing, leading to a subsequent decrease in water availability. This study addresses the critical need for improved water resource forecasting models amidst global water scarcity concerns exacerbated by climate change. This study uses the best weather and water resource forecasting model for sustainable development. Employing a Recurrent Neural Network–Long Short-Term Memory (RNN-LSTM) approach, the research enhances drought prediction capabilities by integrating secondary data of the rainfall, temperature, and ground and surface water supplies. The primary objective is to forecast water resources under changing climatic conditions, facilitating the development of early warning systems for vulnerable regions. The results from the LSTM model show an increased trend in temperature and rainfall patterns. However, a relatively unstable decrease in rainfall is observed. The best statistical analysis result was observed with the LSTM model; the model’s accuracy was 99%, showing that it was quite good at presenting the obtained precipitation, temperature, and water data. Meanwhile, the value of the root mean squared error (RMSE) was about 13, 15, and 20, respectively. Therefore, the study’s results highlight that the LSTM model was the most suitable among the artificial neural networks for forecasting the weather, rainfall, and water resources.

rayyan-224214902,Physics-Informed AI-based Modelling for Flood Early Warning Systems,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Today, the vast majority of early warning systems (EWS) are introduced in which advanced deep learning, recurrent neural network or ensemble-based data mining techniques are applied to provide more accurate and reliable flood forecasting [1]. This trend have been gained more trends mainly due to recent advances in computational capabilities, technological enhancement, and data science-based modelling have empowered these data-driven models [2]. A novel addition in this community is the physics-informed neural network models (PINN), integrating physical principles and constraints into architecture of data driven models. This hybrid approach is particularly beneficial in scenarios where prior knowledge of underlying physics such as nature of rainfall occurrence or catchments hydraulic characteristics are limited [3]. In the present study, PINN-based ensemble multi-class data mining model, inspired by [4] is introduced for forecasting water level classes ranging from no risk to high risk in the context of urban drainage systems (UDS). To keep simplicity, this model is developed with only two datasets: rainfall and UDS water levels. In addition to conventional inputs such as rainfall intensity, duration, session, and soil moisture, two physics-informed rainfall inputs - namely, the potential future return period (RP) of current rainfall and the current return period class - are incorporated. Additionally, two physics-informed catchment water level inputs - specifically, the water level class at the current timestep and the duration of the current class - are integrated into the model framework. The introduction of these new parameters aims to offer valuable insights into system dynamics, enhancing the model's ability to comprehend both short-term and long-term memory patterns. The results, assessed using the method outlined in [2], indicate a substantial improvement in hit rates - from 67% to 88% - compared to a benchmark model. Notably, time lags in the correct detection of water level classes, are halved on average, reducing from 2-timstep intervals. More specifically, the rate of event underestimation decreases from 7% to 2%, showcasing that the new method has the potential to reduce false alarms in EWS. It is essential to note that the application of PINN is currently limited to using only physics-informed input data. However, a promising avenue for future exploration involves extending this approach to adjusting hyperparameters of data-driven models with physics equations. This adaptation is recommended for future directions in research and application. References [1] Piadeh, F., Behzadian, K., Chen, A.S., Campos, L.C., Rizzuto, J., Kapelan, Z. (2023).

rayyan-224214924,Protecting ancient water harvesting technologies in India: strategies for climate adaptation and sustainable development with global lessons,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Introduction Ancient water harvesting systems, such as those from the Indus Valley Civilization (~3500 BCE), have been vital for irrigation and climate resilience, especially in arid regions. One such prominent system in South Asia, called tank irrigation, initially thrived through community management but declined post-independence due to colonial policies and neglect in Sri Lanka and India. This study evaluates current policy frameworks and rehabilitation programs to enhance the resilience of these systems in India, develop strategies for their protection and adaptation to climate change, and integrate global lessons for sustainable development. Methods A systematic meta-analysis of grey literature was conducted to aggregate data on policy constraints. Policy analysis involved detailed investigations of relevant documents, regulations, and comparative analyses of frameworks at regional and national levels. Pilot projects on tank rehabilitation were assessed through reported case studies and field surveys to gauge impact. Thematic analysis was used to explore the global potential of these systems in climate resilience and overall environmental sustainability. Results The analysis showed that pilot projects for tank rehabilitation had limited success in achieving sustainability under current climate conditions. Tank irrigation systems are crucial for adapting to extreme weather, including floods, droughts, and heat waves, replenishing groundwater, reducing soil erosion, and ensuring reliable water supplies. Traditional water harvesting technologies support 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), including clean water access, hunger reduction, gender equality, and climate action. Integrating AI and machine learning in water management benefits disaster response, while eco-tourism aids system maintenance and cultural awareness. Discussion The study underscores the need for policy reforms to enhance tank rehabilitation and institutional arrangements. It calls for increased beneficiary participation and constitutional recognition of current practices. Strategic, national-scale assessments and resilience targets are recommended to improve the effectiveness of such water harvesting systems in mitigating natural hazards and enhancing environmental services.","",https://doi.org/10.3389/frwa.2024.1441365,"",,
rayyan-224215079,Multivariate time series convolutional neural networks for long-term agricultural drought prediction under global warming,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Agricultural drought (AD) is disastrous to crop production and plant growth. The prediction of AD with sufficient lead time is helpful for developing agricultural water strategy, particularly under the context of global warming. However, the previous studies mainly focused on short lead times (1–6 months) and only used 3 or less variables to predict AD through copula models. In this study, a novel multivariate time series convolutional neural network (T-CNN) is developed to predict AD with long lead times based on multiple meteorological variables. To demonstrate its feasibility and novelty, T-CNN is used in the Aral Sea Basin (ASB) where agricultural production is dominant. Three global climate models (GCMs) and three shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs) from CMIP6 are considered during 2026–2100. Results indicate that (1) precipitation, temperature, potential evapotranspiration, relative humidity and northward wind are significantly correlated with AD, and are selected as the predictors of AD; (2) compared with the conventional CNN and convolutional long short-term memory (ConvLSTM), T-CNN's performance is better, taking only about 10% of the computation time of ConvLSTM; (3) T-CNN can effectively extract the spatiotemporal characteristics of meteorological predictors and reproduce AD, showing high correlation coefficients (R>0.9) for 92.5% of the grids across ASB; (4) the result of simple model averaging (SMA) is better than other GCMs, indicating that the spatial differences in AD would become more pronounced with increasing time and emission level; (5) compared with the historical period, under SSP585, the extreme drought would increase 0.20 months/year (2026–2050), 0.23 months/year (2051–2075) and 0.28 months/year (2076–2100).

rayyan-224215098,Hypoxia Forecasting for Chesapeake Bay Using Artificial Intelligence,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract Seasonal hypoxia is a recurring threat to ecosystems and fisheries in the Chesapeake Bay. Hypoxia forecasting based on coupled hydrodynamic and biogeochemical models has proven useful for many stakeholders, as these models excel in accounting for the effects of physical forcing on oxygen supply, but may fall short in replicating the more complex biogeochemical processes that govern oxygen consumption. Satellite-derived reflectances could be used to indicate the presence of surface organic matter over the Bay. However, teasing apart the contribution of atmospheric and aquatic constituents from the signal received by the satellite is not straightforward. As a result, it is difficult to derive surface concentrations of organic matter from satellite data in a robust fashion. A potential solution to this complexity is to use deep learning to build end-to-end applications that do not require precise accounting of the satellite signal from the atmosphere or water, phytoplankton blooms, or sediment plumes. By training a deep neural network with data from a vast suite of variables that could potentially affect oxygen in the water column, improvement of short-term (daily) hypoxia forecast may be possible. Here, we predict oxygen concentrations using inputs that account for both physical and biogeochemical factors. The physical inputs include wind velocity reanalysis information, together with 3D outputs from an estuarine hydrodynamic model, including current velocity, water temperature, and salinity. Satellite-derived spectral reflectance data are used as a surrogate for the biogeochemical factors. These input fields are time series of weekly statistics calculated from daily information, starting 8 weeks before each oxygen observation was collected. To accommodate this input data structure, we adopted a model architecture of long short-term memory networks with eight time steps. At each time step, a set of convolutional neural networks are used to extract information from the inputs. Ablation and cross-validation tests suggest that among all input features, the strongest predictor is the 3D temperature field, with which the new model can outperform the state-of-the-art by ∼20% in terms of median absolute error. Our approach represents a novel application of deep learning to address a complex water management challenge. Significance Statement This study presents a novel approach that combines deep learning and hydrodynamic model outputs to improve the accuracy of hypoxia forecasts in the Chesapeake Bay. By training a deep neural network with both physical and biogeochemical information as input features, the model accurately predicts oxygen concentration at any depth in the water column 1 day in advance. This approach has the potential to benefit stakeholders and inform adaptation measures during the recurring threat of hypoxia in the Chesapeake Bay. The success of this study suggests the potential for similar applications of deep learning to address complex water management challenges. Further research could investigate the application of this approach to different forecast lead times and other regions and ecosystem types.","",https://doi.org/10.1175/aies-d-23-0054.1,"",,

Drought, exacerbated by climate change, significantly affects ecosystems, agriculture, and water resources. Canadian Drought Monitor (CDM) data provided by the Canadian government and ERA5-Land daily data were utilized to generate a comprehensive time series of mean monthly precipitation and air temperature for 199 sample locations in Canada from 1979 to 2023. These data were processed in the Google Earth Engine (GEE) environment and used to develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to estimate CDM values, thereby filling gaps in historical drought data. The CanESM5 climate model, as assessed in the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report, was employed under four climate change scenarios to predict future drought conditions. Our CNN model forecasts CDM values up to 2100, enabling accurate drought zoning. The results reveal significant trends in temperature changes, indicating areas most vulnerable to future droughts, while precipitation shows a slow increasing trend. Our analysis indicates that under extreme climate scenarios, certain regions may experience a significant increase in the frequency and severity of droughts, necessitating proactive planning and mitigation strategies.

Therefore, the principal goal of this study is to isolate the effects of anticipated climate and land-use changes on streamflow at the Indus River, Besham, Pakistan, using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). The multimodal ensemble (MME) of 11 general circulation models (GCMs) under two shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs) 245 and 585 was computed using the Taylor skill score (TSS) and rating metric (RM). Future land use was predicted using the cellular automata artificial neural network (CA-ANN). The impacts of climate change and land-use change were assessed on streamflow under various SSPs and land-use scenarios. To calibrate and validate the SWAT model, the historical record (1991–2013) was divided into the following two parts: calibration (1991–2006) and validation (2007–2013). The SWAT model performed well in simulating streamflow with NSE, R 2 , and RSR values during the calibration and validation phases, which are 0.77, 0.79, and 0.48 and 0.76, 0.78, and 0.49, respectively.

The QGIS 2.16.3 plugin module for land use change evaluation (MOLUSCE) tool with the cellular automata artificial neural network (CA-ANN) was used for LULC prediction based on historical data and exploratory maps. Two commonly used representative concentration pathways (RCPs)—4.5 and 8.5—were used for climate projection in the 2030s, 2050s, and 2070s. The LULC prediction analysis showed an expansion of cropland and settlement areas, with the reduction in the forest and rangelands. The climate projections indicated an increase in maximum temperatures and altered precipitation patterns, particularly with increased wet months and reduced dry periods. The average annual soil loss and sediment yield rates were estimated to increase under both the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 climate scenarios, with a more noticeable increase under RCP8.5. By integrating DEM, soil, land use, and climate data, we evaluated runoff, soil loss, and sediment yield changes on only land use/cover, only climate, and the combined impacts in the watershed. The results revealed that, under all combined scenarios, the sediment yield in the Megech Reservoir was projected to substantially increase by 23.28–41.01%, showing a potential loss of reservoir capacity.

Floods in Malaysia happen every year, especially in East Coast Peninsular Malaysia, due to the Northeast Monsoon and climate change, which may lead to heavy rainfall throughout the end of the year. Temerloh is one of the districts in Pahang that frequently encounters flood events, especially between November and January every year. Even though there are multiple efforts in flood mitigation and preparation, the damage to citizens and properties every year has cost thousands of Ringgits and the time taken to clean the damages caused by floods. Despite this, research on flood prediction in the state needs to be done using machine learning techniques. Due to this, this research explored the hydrological and meteorological factors that caused the flood in Temerloh and developed a machine-learning model capable of predicting the flood occurrence. The study used a dataset from the National Hydrological Network Management System (SPRHiN), which consists of hydrological data, and weather underground for the meteorological data in the location. The correlation analysis found that stream flow and water level are highly correlated to floods, with correlation coefficients (r values) of 0.83 and 0.76, respectively, while the temperature is inversely related to floods with a -0.28 correlation value. A lower temperature has a higher chance of rain and subsequent flooding. The results show that the model, by using an artificial neural network (ANN), has produced an accuracy of 0.9909 and a good performance of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) curve (AUC) at 0.888.

Leveraging this sensor platform, we developed a CNN-AutoEncoder-SOM solution to automatically monitor, process, and evaluate water quality evolution in the lake. There are three components in this solution. The first one focuses on anomaly detection. We employed a recurrence map to encode the temporal dynamics and sensor correlations, which were then fed into a convolutional neural network (CNN) for classification. It is noted that this network achieved an impressive accuracy of up to 99.6%. Once an anomaly is detected, the data are calibrated in the second component using an AutoEncoder-based network. Since true values for calibration are unavailable, the results are evaluated through data analysis. With high-quality calibrated data in hand, we proceeded to cluster the data into different categories to establish water quality standards in the third component, where a self-organizing map (SOM) is applied. The results revealed that this solution demonstrated significant performance, with a silhouette score of 0.73, which illustrates a small in-cluster distance and large intra-cluster distance when the water was clustered into three levels. This system not only achieved the objective of developing a comprehensive solution for continuous water quality monitoring but also offers the potential for integration with other cyber–physical systems (CPSs) in urban water management.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/w16091238,"",,

Many researchers have published on streamflow prediction using techniques like Rainfall-Runoff modelling, Time series Models, Data-driven models, Artificial intelligence, etc. Still, there needs to be generalised method practise in the real world. The resolution of this issue lies in selecting different methods for a particular study area. This paper uses the Support vector regression machine learning model to predict the streamflow for the Tehri Dam, Uttarakhand, India, at the Daily and Ten Daily time steps. Two cases are considered in predicting daily and ten daily time steps. The first case includes four input variables: Discharge, Rainfall, Temperature, and Snow cover area. The second case comprises only three input variables: Rainfall, Temperature, and Snow cover area. Radial Kernel is used to overcome the space complexity in the datasets. The K-fold cross-validation is suitable for prediction as it averages the prediction error rate after evaluating the SVR model’s performance on various subsets of the training data. The streamflow data for daily and ten daily time steps have been collected from 2006 to 2020. The calibration period is from 2006 to 2016, and the validation period is from 2017 to 2020. Nash Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) and Coefficient of determination ( R 2 ) are used as the accuracy indicator in this manuscript. The lag has been observed in the daily prediction time series when three input variables are considered. For other scenarios, the respective model shows excellent results at both the temporal scale and the parametres, which play a vital role in prediction. The study also enhances the effect on the potential use of input parametres in the machine learning model.","",https://doi.org/10.1007/s13201-024-02135-0,"",,

Developing an innovative and robust decision support framework (DSF) is essential for effective and efficient water quality management, so it can provide essential information on water quality and assist policy makers and water resource managers to identify potential causes of water quality deterioration. This framework is crucial for implementing actions such as infrastructure development, legislative compliance and environmental initiatives. Recent advancements in computational domains have created opportunities for employing artificial intelligence (AI), advanced statistics and mathematical methods for use in improved water quality management. This study proposed a comprehensive conceptual DSF to minimise the adverse effects of extreme weather events and climate change on water quality. The framework utilises machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), geographical information system (GIS) and advanced statistical and mathematical techniques for water quality management. The foundation of this framework is the outcomes from our three studies, where we examined the application of ML and DL models for predicting water quality index (WQI) in reservoirs, utilising statistical and mathematical methods to find the seasonal trend of rainfall and water quality, exploring the potential connection between streamflow, rainfall and water quality, and employing GIS to show the spatial and temporal variability of hydrological parameters and WQI. Three potable water supply reservoirs in the Toowoomba region of Australia were taken as the study area for practical implementation of the proposed DSF. This framework can serve as a comprehensive mechanism to identify distinct seasonal characteristics and understand correlations between rainfall, streamflow and water quality. This will enable policy makers and water resource managers to enhance their decision making processes by selecting the management priorities to safeguard water quality in the face of future climate variability, including prolonged droughts and flooding.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/w16202944,"",,

In this study, two different machine models, namely the cascade correlation neural network (CCNN) and feedforward neural network (FFNN) were applied to predict daily-suspended sediment concentration (SSC) at Simga and Jondhara stations in Sheonath basin, India. Daily-suspended sediment concentration and discharge data from 2010 to 2015 were collected and used to develop the model to predict suspended sediment concentration. The developed models were evaluated using statistical indices like Nash and Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (N ES ), root mean square error (RMSE), Willmott’s index of agreement (WI), and Legates–McCabe’s index (LM), supplemented by a scatter plot, density plots, histograms and Taylor diagram for graphical representation. The developed model was evaluated and compared with CCNN and FFNN. Nine input combinations were explored using different lag-times for discharge (Q t-n ) and suspended sediment concentration (S t-n ) as input variables, with the current suspended sediment concentration as the desired output, to develop CCNN and FFNN models. The CCNN4 model with 4 lagged inputs (S t-1 , S t-2 , S t-3 , S t-4 ) outperformed the other developed models with the lowest RMSE = 95.02 mg/l and the highest N ES = 0.0.662, WI = 0.890 and LM = 0.668 for the Jondhara Station while the same CCNN4 model secure as the best with the lowest RMSE = 53.71 mg/l and the highest N ES = 0.785, WI = 0.936 and LM = 0.788 for the Simga Station. The result shows the CCNN model was better than the FFNN model for predicting daily-suspended sediment at both stations in the Sheonath basin, India. Overall, CCNN showed better forecasting potential for suspended sediment concentration compared to FFNN at both stations, demonstrating their applicability for hydrological forecasting with complex relationships.","",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-61339-1,"",,

In this paper, we analyse the impact of satellite-derived surface-rainfall-rate data assimilation on the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model’s precipitation prediction, considering 15 days in summer 2022 and 17 days in fall 2022, where moderate to intense precipitation was observed over Italy. A 3DVar realised at CNR-ISAC (National Research Council of Italy, Institute of Atmospheric Sciences and Climate) is used to assimilate two different satellite-derived rain rate products, both exploiting geostationary (GEO), infrared (IR), and low-Earth-orbit (LEO) microwave (MW) measurements: One is based on an artificial neural network (NN), and the other one is the operational P-IN-SEVIRI-PMW product (H60), delivered in near-real time by the EUMETSAT HSAF (Satellite Application Facility in Support of Operational Hydrology and Water Management). The forecast is verified in two periods: the hours from 1 to 4 (1–4 h phase) and the hours from 3 to 6 (3–6 h phase) after the assimilation. The results show that the rain rate assimilation improves the precipitation forecast in both seasons and for both forecast phases, even if the improvement in the 3–6 h phase is found mainly in summer. The assimilation of H60 produces a high number of false alarms, which has a negative impact on the forecast, especially for intense events (30 mm/3 h). The assimilation of the NN rain rate gives more balanced predictions, improving the control forecast without significantly increasing false alarms.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/rs16101769,"",,

Better quantification of θ crit is needed for improving future projections of climate and water resources, food production, and ecosystem vulnerability. Here, we combine systematic satellite observations of the diurnal amplitude of land surface temperature (dLST) and SM during dry-downs, corroborated by in-situ data from flux towers, to generate the observation-based global map of θ crit . We find an average global θ crit of 0.19 m 3 /m 3 , varying from 0.12 m 3 /m 3 in arid ecosystems to 0.26 m 3 /m 3 in humid ecosystems. θ crit simulated by Earth System Models is overestimated in dry areas and underestimated in wet areas. The global observed pattern of θ crit reflects plant adaptation to soil available water and atmospheric demand. Using explainable machine learning, we show that aridity index, leaf area and soil texture are the most influential drivers. Moreover, we show that the annual fraction of days with water stress, when SM stays below θ crit , has increased in the past four decades. Our results have important implications for understanding the inception of water stress in models and identifying SM tipping points.","",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-49244-7,"",,

The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) has a notable physical foundation and is widely used in hydrological research. However, it uses a simplified vegetation growth model, introducing uncertainty into the simulation results. This study focused on improving the model based on remotely sensed phenological and leaf area index (LAI) data. Phenological data were used to define vegetation dormancy, and the LAI data replaced the corresponding data simulated by the original model. This approach improved the accuracy of the model in describing vegetation dynamics. Then, the enhanced SWAT model was coupled with the bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) model to validate the simulation of hydrological processes upstream of the Hei River. During model validation, the performance of the enhanced SWAT model in simulating streamflow (R2 = 0.835, NSE = 0.819) was better than that of the original SWAT model (R2 = 0.821, NSE = 0.805). In terms of simulating evapotranspiration, the enhanced SWAT model demonstrated even greater advantages. During the verification period, compared to those of the SWAT model, the R2 and NSE values of the enhanced SWAT model for daily-scale simulations increased from 0.196 and −0.269 to 0.777 and 0.732, respectively. The R2 and NSE values for monthly-scale simulations increased from 0.782 and 0.678 to 0.906 and 0.851, respectively. Simultaneously, the performance levels of two coupling approaches in streamflow prediction were compared, i.e., direct coupling of the original SWAT and BiLSTM models (SWAT-BiLSTM) and coupling of the enhanced SWAT and BiLSTM models (enhanced SWAT-BiLSTM). The results showed that the enhanced SWAT-BiLSTM model always performed better than the SWAT-BiLSTM model during the entire simulation period, especially the enhanced SWAT-BiLSTM model, which could more accurately predict peak streamflow changes. This study demonstrated that coupling an improved physical model with deep learning models could improve the streamflow prediction accuracy.","",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2024.131117,"",,

The inflows distributed through outlets must adhere to pre-designated levels, defined by Punjab Irrigation Department from head to tail. With recent channels lining, the outlets sanctioned flow are found changed requiring adjustments. Furthermore, there is lack of reliable mechanisms for continuous flow regulations, resulting in unmanaged distributions. The focus of the reported work was on precise and real-time discharge monitoring at outlets using a newly developed device utilizing Artificial Intelligence. During validation training, strong agreement was observed, and all evaluation parameters supported the device accuracy for measurements. In detailed studies of canal operations, the sanctioned discharges of individual outlets along selected distributaries were found significantly inequitable. Out of 162 outlets, 42 were suspended for being unmanaged, with tail users receiving ≤ 50% of their fair intakes. Additionally, there were instances of massive irrational supplies exceeding 200% of allocated discharges. The developed device has potential to accurately measure real-time discharges for managed distributions. Conclusively, the challenging task of fair and equity-based discharge allocations, in conjunction with Warabandi system, necessitates the reevaluation of the allocated flow quantity at each outlet.","",https://doi.org/10.2166/wp.2024.265,"",,

Based on two machine learning (ML) models, Gradient Boost Regressor (GBR) and long‐short‐term‐memory (LSTM) network, this study developed three ML model approaches: direct GBR; direct LSTM; and a 2‐step mixed ML model workflow combining both GBR and LSTM. They were used to simulate multi‐year surface and bottom DO concentrations in five lakes. All approaches were trained with readily available environmental data as predictors. Indices of lake thermal structure and mixing provided by a one‐dimensional (1‐D) hydrodynamic model were also included as predictors in the ML models. The advantages of each ML approach were not consistent for all the tested lakes, but the best one of them was defined that can estimate DO concentration with coefficient of determination ( R 2 ) up to 0.6–0.7 in each lake. All three approaches have normalized mean absolute error (NMAE) under 0.15. In a polymictic lake, the 2‐step mixed model workflow showed better representation of bottom DO concentrations, with a highest true positive rate (TPR) of hypolimnetic hypoxia detection of over 90%, while the other workflows resulted in, TPRs are around 50%. In most of the tested lakes, the predicted surface DO concentrations and variables indicating stratified conditions (i.e., Wedderburn number and the temperature difference between surface and bottom water) are essential for simulating bottom DO.

One of the major challenges is the quick and accurate detection of leaks, which can lead to water loss, infrastructure damage, and environmental hazards. Many existing leak detection methods are ineffective, especially in complex and aging pipeline networks. If these limitations are not overcome, it can result in a chain of infrastructure failures, exacerbating damage, increasing repair costs, and causing water shortages and public health risks. The leak issue is further complicated by increasing urban water demand, climate change, and population growth. Therefore, there is an urgent need for intelligent systems that can overcome the limitations of traditional methodologies and leverage sophisticated data analysis and machine learning technologies. In this study, we propose a reliable and advanced method for detecting leaks in water pipes using a framework based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks combined with autoencoders. The framework is designed to manage the temporal dimension of time-series data and is enhanced with ensemble learning techniques, making it sensitive to subtle signals indicating leaks while robustly dealing with noise signals. Through the integration of signal processing and pattern recognition, the machine learning-based model addresses the leak detection problem, providing an intelligent system that enhances environmental protection and resource management.

Irish oceanic raised bogs are a rare peatland ecosystem offering numerous ecosystem services, including C storage, biodiversity support and water regulation. However, they have been degraded over the centuries due to artificial drainage, followed by peat extraction, afforestation and agriculture. This has an overall negative impact on the functioning of peatlands, shifting them from a moderate C sink to a large C source. Recognizing the importance of these ecosystems, efforts are underway for conservation (rewetting and rehabilitation), while accurately accounting for C stock and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. However, the implementation of these efforts requires accurate identification and mapping of artificial drainage ditches. This study utilized very high‐resolution (25 cm) aerial imagery, and a deep learning (U‐Net) approach to map the visible artificial drainage (unobstructed by vegetation or infill) in raised bogs at a national scale. The results show that artificial drainage is widespread, with ~20 000 km of drains mapped. The overall accuracy of the model was 80% on an independent testing dataset. The data were also used to derive the Frac ditch which was 0.03 (fraction of artificial drainage on industrial peat extraction sites). This is lower than IPCC Tier 1 Frac ditch and can aid in IPCC Tier 2 reporting for Ireland. This is the first study to map drains with diverse sizes and patterns on Irish‐raised bogs using optical aerial imagery and deep learning methods. The map will serve as an important baseline dataset for evaluating the artificial drainage ditch conditions. It will prove useful for sustainable management, conservation and refined estimations of GHG emissions. The model's capacity for generalization implies its potential in mapping artificial drains in peatlands at a regional and global scale, thereby enhancing the comprehension of the global effects of artificial drainage ditches on peatlands.","",https://doi.org/10.1002/rse2.387,"",,

For a sustainable transition to a low-carbon future, it is essential to minimise impacts of mineral resource development to the environment, ecosystems, and societies of these nations. Although there has been considerable progress in the social aspects of the mining sector, environmental metrics are not showing comparable improvement. The Philippines exemplifies this challenge as a country that aims to conserve its exceptional biodiversity to maximise ecosystem services while expanding mining activities for economic growth, in a geographical setting with high mineral potential and vulnerability to natural hazards and climate change. Similar to many mining areas, environmental baselines are mostly non-existent, compounded by a legacy of mining impacts despite an established policy framework. We review issues associated with large- and small-scale mining and identify underlying research challenges and opportunities in the Philippines. Potential environmental research pathways include (i) innovative approaches for catchment scale characterisation and identification of contaminant sources; (ii) quantifying and predicting contaminant transport; (iii) deployment of flexible monitoring devices for larger-scale water quality monitoring programmes; (iv) tailings dam monitoring and management; and (v) resource assessment and metal recovery in ores and tailings. By integrating geomorphological tools with geochemical data, as well as 2D/3D numerical modelling techniques, it becomes possible to predict and understand the behaviour and fate of contaminants across different spatial and temporal scales. The development of cost-effective water quality assessment devices and protocols can help overcome logistical challenges in monitoring a wider range of hydrological conditions. Advanced applications of remote sensing, combined with machine learning, and geophysical monitoring systems provide new opportunities to detect mining footprints and observe change in tailings dams more effectively. Potential impacts of mine wastes can be further minimised by exploring innovative technologies such as the use of metal-accumulating native plant species and environmentally safe solvents to reprocess modern and legacy tailings. Insights from these pathways will enable the realisation of a more sustainable mining future, through the incorporation of findings into existing and future governmental and small- and large-scale mining policy and practice.

The model can identify high-risk situations and issue timely warnings to prevent further pollution by analysing historical weather patterns and their correlation with pollution incidents. The system's computational framework utilises a deep neural network to analyse and interpret the collected data. The model is fine-tuned and calibrated using historic data, allowing it to effectively recognise and predict pollution events in real-time for every flood event through combined sewer overflow structures. By integrating historical and real-time data, the model can enhance predictive capabilities of pollution spread in the river system and hence prepare the relevant bodies to take appropriate actions in time.&amp;#160;The proposed method holds great promise in mitigating the adverse impacts of pollution on the river's ecosystem and the surrounding communities. By integrating diverse data sources, including in-situ measurements, sensing systems, and weather information, the model provides a holistic understanding of pollution dynamics and enables proactive pollution control measures. Implementing this model can contribute significantly to preserving the health and ecological integrity of the Thames River, serving as a blueprint for other river systems facing similar pollution challenges worldwide.&amp;#160;References[1] Yuxi, X., Weihua, Z., Jie, Q.

rayyan-224215677,A new era of genetic diversity conservation through novel tools and accessible data,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Due to increasing alarm over lost diversity, the past few years have seen quantum leaps in making genetics more accessible and relevant for use in practice and policy. A historic advance for conservation was made at the 2022 United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity COP15, when genetic diversity was protected for all species—not just socioeconomically and culturally valuable ones—in the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF). Here, we highlight new, affordable, and inclusive tools for measuring genetic diversity and emphasize the importance of their use to benefit nature and society. Improved application of genetic diversity data to conservation and management first requires documenting change across space and time. Meta-analyses have shown substantial genetic losses—incurred during the past century—in many species, especially those endemic to islands or that are heavily harvested (eg commercial fisheries). Genomic patterns across thousands of DNA nucleotides (eg runs of homozygosity) can now provide deeper insight into demographic histories, inbreeding, and the effects of natural selection. New models such as the mutations–area relationship can quantify the effects of habitat loss on genetic diversity at the population level, thereby helping to approximate the impacts of both threats and management (including restoration) activities. Meanwhile, Genetic Composition Essential Biodiversity Variables were developed to standardize the reporting of genetic diversity and to facilitate comparisons across studies (Biol Rev 2022; doi.org/10.1111/brv.12852). FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) have also been embraced to enable better comparisons across species and regions and to allow for more transparent and rigorous conclusions. Major efforts have focused on compiling, aggregating, and creating detailed metadata for thousands of previously produced genetic datasets. Through such efforts, an entirely new discipline—macrogenetics, which involves analyzing thousands of datasets to identify ecological drivers of genetic change in space and time—has arisen. Macrogenetics can empower systematic conservation planning, while also enabling the comparison of global genetic diversity maps to species-richness maps (Nat Rev Genet 2021; doi.org/10.1038/s41576-021-00394-0). Even as genetic data become more available, >99% of described species have yet to be studied genetically. Consequently, scalable and affordable non-DNA–based indicators were built on core evolutionary principles (eg maintaining sufficiently large distinct populations to prevent genetic erosion) and adopted by the GBF. These indicators enable rapid estimation of genetic diversity for more inclusive assessment and conservation action at large scales, including within developing and megadiverse countries (Conserv Lett 2023; doi.org/10.1111/conl.12953). Inclusivity is an important emphasis for the field of conservation genetics, with CARE principles (Collective benefit, Authority to control, Responsibility, and Ethics) adopted/adhered to during the collection, analysis, storage, and interpretation of genetic data, and linkage to other biodiversity information (eg occurrence data in the Global Biodiversity Information Facility). For decades, analyses of DNA sequences have helped guide ecological restoration, assess population resilience, and track processes like inbreeding or hybridization to address applied management questions. Formalized genetic monitoring programs at regional or national levels can be used to repeatedly and systematically assess populations through time to detect deleterious changes in genetic diversity that may require urgent protections. Genetic monitoring across species and ecosystems has identified areas undergoing rapid habitat loss or climate change—for example, by highlighting the importance of niche margins to protect unique genetic diversity (Nat Ecol Evol 2024; doi.org/10.1038/s41559-023-02260-0). Moving forward, genetic diversity assessments are likely to include more remote data collection, like environmental DNA (eDNA), to infer species' presence through the analysis of DNA shed into the environment (for example, in water, soil, or air). The field of eDNA is experiencing rapid technological advances that include abundance estimations and the sequencing of genetic diversity within populations. Simultaneously, high-resolution satellite imagery and deep learning can be used to estimate genetic diversity and population differentiation, without the need to physically sample DNA. We have entered a new era of transparent and inclusive analysis of the world's genetic diversity with advancements in macrogenetics, proxy-based tools, FAIR and CARE standards, and novel technologies. Uptake of new approaches can be amplified by collaborating through regional and global initiatives, such as the Coalition for Conservation Genetics (Conserv Sci Pract 2022; doi.org/10.1111/csp2.12635). Additional resources, along with new legal frameworks, tools, and policies, can help to advance the contributions of genetics in applied ecology and biodiversity conservation.","",https://doi.org/10.1002/fee.2740,"",,
rayyan-224215693,"Regional Climate Change and Drought Dynamics in Tunceli, Turkey: Insights from Drought Indices",,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract Global warming and climate change are causing temperatures to rise, which is having a negative impact on water resources. Climate change is a worldwide problem that affects and will continue to affect the frequency and intensity of natural disasters in many regions of the world. Tunceli region in Turkey, which until 10 years ago was known as an environmentally friendly city with abundant water resources and frequent rainfall, is experiencing a decrease in precipitation during the snowy winter season. This situation has made the investigation of climate change impacts an important issue in the region. Therefore, effective climate change adaptation strategies need to be developed. To determine these strategies, in this study, we assessed long-term drought conditions using multiple drought indices such as Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), Reconnaissance Drought Index (RDI), Normal Precipitation Index (PNI), and Aridity Index (AI). The SPI and RDI analyses were performed in annual reference periods on a time scale of 3, 6, 9, and 12 months using temperature, precipitation, and evaporation data. Consequently, the SPI and RDI results were compared, and both indices show similar behavior in dry, wet, and normal seasons. Nevertheless, RDI shows less variation between different time scales, which is an advantage over SPI and is probably due to the inclusion of potential evapotranspiration in RDI. The variations in PNI between humid and dry sub-humid categorizations throughout the years, combined with the AI results, indicate that the Tunceli region predominantly experiences a climate ranging from dry sub-humid to semi-arid. This study could help decision-makers take effective measures to become more resilient to climate change in temperate climate regions and take important steps toward sustainable water resources management.","",https://doi.org/10.1007/s41101-024-00281-9,"",,
rayyan-224215732,"Estimating the soil water retention curve by the HYPROP-WP4C system, HYPROP-based PCNN-PTF and inverse modeling using HYDRUS-1D",,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Due to the difficulty of direct field measurement, soil hydraulic properties are often obtained in laboratory settings using small undisturbed soil samples or estimated indirectly through pedotransfer functions (PTFs). The pseudo-continuous pedotransfer function (PCNN-PTF) is a neural network-based approach for estimating soil hydraulic properties. The main objective of this study was to use field soil moisture and tension data to assess soil water retention curves obtained from the HYPROP-WP4C system and the HYPROP-based PCNN-PTF. The in-situ soil water retention data were simultaneously acquired using Acclima TDT and MeterGroup MPS-6 sensors (every 30 min, May to September 2020) from 11 hybrid bermudagrass plots under different irrigation treatments in Riverside, California. We utilized extended evaporation and dewpoint methods using HYPROP-WP4C (Meter Group Inc., USA) devices to obtain lab-measured SWRCs. In addition, SWRCs were estimated from Rosetta (Schaap et al., 2001) and by inverse modeling in HYDRUS-1D utilizing in-situ moisture retention data. Although the hysteresis impacted field data, overall, there was a good agreement between the in-situ and lab water retention data for most samples, especially within the pF range of 2–3.5. The PCNN-PTF outperformed Rosetta in estimating laboratory (RMSE=0.034 cm3 cm−3 vs 0.063 cm3 cm−3) and in-situ soil moisture data (RMSE=0.048 cm3 cm−3 vs 0.082 cm3 cm−3). Inverse modeling of in-situ data also performed well in estimating the SWRC (RMSE=0.043 cm3 cm−3); however, further attention is required in dry and saturated soil conditions. We developed a simple, free, and easy-to-access tool called PC-PTF for estimating the SWRC using the PCNN-PTF model evaluated in this study. The PC-PTF can be accessed from the Verdi Water Management Group website: http://www.ucrwater.com/software-and-tools.html.","",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2024.131657,"",,
rayyan-224215830,Implications of uncontrolled water withdrawal and climate change on the water supply and demand gap in the Lake Tana sub-basin,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"This study evaluates the implications of multiple climatic and non-climatic factors on the water resource of the Lake Tana sub-basin, Ethiopia. The study focuses on three drivers: land use change, irrigation expansion, and climate change (CC), and their impact on the current and future water availability across the sub-basin. The study uses a random forest (RF) machine learning classifier in the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform to detect land use land cover change (LULC) and for mapping the actual irrigated-area. The Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation and temperature data were used with station data to evaluate the implication of CC on the water availability of Lake Tana sub-basin. The supply-demand relationship was done for Gumara catchment within Tana sub-basin as an experimental site. Based on the LULC analysis, plantation, cropland, bare lands, built-up, and wetland showed an increasing trend, while forest, bush land, and grassland showed a decreasing trend. The increasing rate of crop land in the expense of natural forest, shrub land, grassland may cause runoff/flood, high soil erosion, and lower rate of groundwater recharge. The actual irrigated area mapping analysis shows a widespread irrigation near the Lake Shore and upstream parts of the sub-basin. The climate change analysis shows an increasing trend of potential evapotranspiration during the irrigation period attributed to increase in maximum temperature. The rising of potential evapotranspiration during the irrigation period creates a water shortage in the study and future periods as the crops need more water for growth. The estimated stream flow for Gumara catchment shows an increasing trend for the future period. The supply-demand relationship of the catchment shows an uneven distribution of water in the Gumara catchment both in the current and future periods resulting in unbalance abstraction of irrigation water. The study reveals that climate change, land cover change, and uncontrolled expansion of irrigated land area are likely to increase the unmet demand by increasing irrigation water demand, and this can cause conflict of interest between the users. Therefore, sustainable water resource management practices such as land management practices, and adaptive management of irrigation should be applicable to prevent or reduce the occurrence of conflict over the water demand.","",https://doi.org/10.59122/15519a9,"",,

In order to accurately predict climate change in Weifang City, China, this study utilizes multiple data-driven deep learning models. The climate data for 73 years include monthly average air temperature (MAAT), monthly average minimum air temperature (MAMINAT), monthly average maximum air temperature (MAMAXAT), and monthly total precipitation (MP). The different deep learning models include artificial neural network (ANN), recurrent NN (RNN), gate recurrent unit (GRU), long short-term memory neural network (LSTM), deep convolutional NN (CNN), hybrid CNN-GRU, hybrid CNN-LSTM, and hybrid CNN-LSTM-GRU. The CNN-LSTM-GRU for MAAT prediction is the best-performing model compared to other deep learning models with the highest correlation coefficient (R = 0.9879) and lowest root mean square error (RMSE = 1.5347) and mean absolute error (MAE = 1.1830). These results indicate that The hybrid CNN-LSTM-GRU method is a suitable climate prediction model. This deep learning method can also be used for surface water modeling.

As water demand forecasting plays a key role in urban water management, identifying factors influencing water demand is particularly important to mitigate water shortage crises. This study utilizes a Markov chain model and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to estimate short-term urban water demand in Tehran. The variables considered for estimation include maximum temperature, water consumption, and precipitation rate in the previous four days. These variables are used as previous events to predict water consumption on the fifth day. Daily data from March 21, 2018 to March 19, 2021 were collected for analysis. The results of the study indicate that the Markov model's forecasting is more accurate compared to the ANN model. The Markov chain model demonstrated 48% and 65% improvement in accuracy compared to the ANN model for the test data and the training data, respectively. This suggests that a Markov chain model can be a valuable tool for estimating short-term urban water demand.

rayyan-224215990,Remote Sensing and Modeling of the Cryosphere in High Mountain Asia: A Multidisciplinary Review,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Over the past decades, the cryosphere has changed significantly in High Mountain Asia (HMA), leading to multiple natural hazards such as rock–ice avalanches, glacier collapse, debris flows, landslides, and glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs). Monitoring cryosphere change and evaluating its hydrological effects are essential for studying climate change, the hydrological cycle, water resource management, and natural disaster mitigation and prevention. However, knowledge gaps, data uncertainties, and other substantial challenges limit comprehensive research in climate–cryosphere–hydrology–hazard systems. To address this, we provide an up-to-date, comprehensive, multidisciplinary review of remote sensing techniques in cryosphere studies, demonstrating primary methodologies for delineating glaciers and measuring geodetic glacier mass balance change, glacier thickness, glacier motion or ice velocity, snow extent and water equivalent, frozen ground or frozen soil, lake ice, and glacier-related hazards. The principal results and data achievements are summarized, including URL links for available products and related data platforms. We then describe the main challenges for cryosphere monitoring using satellite-based datasets. Among these challenges, the most significant limitations in accurate data inversion from remotely sensed data are attributed to the high uncertainties and inconsistent estimations due to rough terrain, the various techniques employed, data variability across the same regions (e.g., glacier mass balance change, snow depth retrieval, and the active layer thickness of frozen ground), and poor-quality optical images due to cloudy weather. The paucity of ground observations and validations with few long-term, continuous datasets also limits the utilization of satellite-based cryosphere studies and large-scale hydrological models. Lastly, we address potential breakthroughs in future studies, i.e., (1) outlining debris-covered glacier margins explicitly involving glacier areas in rough mountain shadows, (2) developing highly accurate snow depth retrieval methods by establishing a microwave emission model of snowpack in mountainous regions, (3) advancing techniques for subsurface complex freeze–thaw process observations from space, (4) filling knowledge gaps on scattering mechanisms varying with surface features (e.g., lake ice thickness and varying snow features on lake ice), and (5) improving and cross-verifying the data retrieval accuracy by combining different remote sensing techniques and physical models using machine learning methods and assimilation of multiple high-temporal-resolution datasets from multiple platforms. This comprehensive, multidisciplinary review highlights cryospheric studies incorporating spaceborne observations and hydrological models from diversified techniques/methodologies (e.g., multi-spectral optical data with thermal bands, SAR, InSAR, passive microwave, and altimetry), providing a valuable reference for what scientists have achieved in cryosphere change research and its hydrological effects on the Third Pole.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/rs16101709,"",,

Utilizing a comprehensive dataset from the Slovak Hydrometeorological Institute SHMI (2008-2020), which includes precipitation, water level, and discharge data, the model was trained using a ladder technique with a custom loss function to enhance focus on extreme values. The architecture integrates Recurrent and Convolutional Neural Networks (RNN, CNN), and Multi-Head Attention layers. Hydro-Informer achieved significant performance, with a Coefficient of Determination (R²) of 0.88, effectively predicting extreme water levels 12 hours in advance in a river environment free from human regulation and structures. These results demonstrate the model's robustness in identifying extreme events with minimal underestimation, essential for flood management and disaster preparedness. The study underscores the model's potential to enhance early warning systems and support timely evacuation and infrastructure planning, thereby mitigating flood impacts. Future research should explore integrating additional data sources and further refining the model to improve prediction accuracy and reliability.

Water quality evaluation is essential to develop remediation and management strategies. Computational tools such as machine learning based predictive models have been developed to improve monitoring network capabilities. The model's performance is reduced when datasets composed of reductant information are used for training, on the other hand, the selection of most representative and variable water quality scenarios could result in higher precision. This study analyzed historical water quality behavior in the Santiago River, Mexico, to identify the most variable and representative data available to train machine learning models (Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System – ANFIS, Artificial Neural Network – ANN, and Support Vector Machine - SVM). Thirteen monitoring sites were clustered according to their water quality variability from 2009 to 2022. Subsequently, a Time Series Analysis (TSA) was used to select the most representative monitoring station from each cluster. Data for 6/13 monitoring sites were retained for the Best Training Subset (BTS) used to train restricted models that performed with similar (ANN and SMV) or higher (ANFIS) prediction accuracy (in terms of RMSE, MAE, MSE and R2) for both training and testing. This study provides evidence of water quality data containing redundant information that is not useful to improve machine learning model performance, in turn leading to overtraining. Combined analytical approaches can maximize the representativeness and variability of data selected for machine learning applications, leading to improved prediction.","",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoinf.2024.102655,"",,

Traditionally, cloud observations are made visually by experienced observers, which can introduce human errors and inconsistencies. This study aims to develop accurate deep learning models for automated cloud classification from ground‐based images. A dataset of over 200,000 cloud photographs was collected from professional observers at meteorological stations of the Institute of Meteorology and Water Management–National Research Institute. The images were preprocessed and annotated with cloud type labels. Convolutional neural networks and transformer models were employed for feature extraction, combined with multilayer perceptrons for classification. Different architectures were explored, including ResNet, EfficientNet, Vision Transformers, and their variants. Hyperparameter tuning and data augmentation techniques like RandAugment were applied to improve generalisation. The best‐performing model achieved 97.4% accuracy for classifying four common cloud genera: cirrus, cumulus, stratus, and clear sky. Additional experiments classified up to 11 genera, with accuracy decreasing as complexity increased, due to data limitations. Error analysis revealed confusions between visually similar classes. While promising, limitations exist from using partial cloud views versus whole‐sky imagery. We start with four classes and end with 11 classes, progressively showing subsequent errors in the cloud genera classification process, something not presented in other publications. Future work involves collecting a more balanced dataset with standardised protocols. Integration of all‐sky cameras could help address current restrictions.

Geodiversity underpins the systems that support the living natural world: it is the steadfast, resolute partnership of humans and biodiversity, providing what the planet needs to support life and many materials we rely on in our daily lives. Its value is also inherent, with geoheritage sites enjoyed across the world. Humans have always had a close cultural connection with geodiversity and its elements, and its important role was highlighted in the 1990s in relation to 'geoindicators' [1]. Yet it is only recently that the importance of considering geodiversity has been more widely and deeply discussed. This is not least because of emerging unsustainable human and natural changes that threaten geodiversity globally. While climate and biodiversity are now routinely included in international conventions and policy briefings (e.g. in the form of 'essential variables'), abiotic variables other than climate have been largely overlooked. This risks biased or inadequate policy and management decisions around surface and subsurface features and resources, as well as incomplete ecological analyses that may impair biodiversity conservation. To move these discussions forwards, we applied for Royal Society Hooke Theo Murphy funding for a meeting of international experts across several facets of geodiversity research. We were awarded the funding in 2019, hoping for a spring 2020 meeting, but we all know what happened then. Instead of transferring the meeting online, we decided to wait until we could see each other in person. We were finally able to meet in January 2023 at the University of Nottingham, UK. Publication of our PNAS paper on Essential Geodiversity Variables (EGVs; [2]) laid the foundation for this meeting. The paper was predicated on the idea that despite the importance of and threats to geodiversity, we do not have sufficient information to assess changes in geodiversity and the services it provides to us and nature at local, national and global scales. This is because: geodiversity tends to be accounted for differently (if at all) in ecological studies; there is no guidance on which elements of geodiversity are relevant for this purpose; and geodiversity data are not generally shared internationally in line with FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable [being able to readily exchange information] and reusable) data principles. In response, we suggested learning from other disciplines to tackle this challenge, particularly work related to 'Essential Variable' (EV) frameworks. EV frameworks aim to align approaches in data collection, analysis and storage for effective and consistent monitoring of key planetary systems for the public, scientists and policymakers. They already existed for biodiversity, climate, oceans and sustainable development goals: we added geodiversity. After some progress since that publication, our meeting and this associated themed issue provide an update on novel research and remaining challenges on various facets of geodiversity discussions, with Schrodt et al.'s [3] paper giving an update on EGVs and what we need to do next. All papers in this themed issue have had to in some way define 'geodiversity'. The editors were not prescriptive about this because different fields approach the term in a slightly different way. The key is that the definition is clear in a given piece of work, and acknowledges if and where it differs from more widely used definitions. Widely accepted definitions encompass explicit surface and subsurface features and processes relating to specific geomorphological landforms and processes, geological types and hydrological features, for example, while broader definitions may also encompass topographic variables (e.g. elevation), and the broadest consider geodiversity analogous to the geosphere (i.e. lithosphere, atmosphere, hydrosphere and cryosphere). In this themed issue, Hjort et al. [4] in particular aim to make strides 'Towards a taxonomy of geodiversity', considering a language that everyone can rally around, drawing inspiration from the taxonomy we use to define living organisms. We wanted to give readers a sense of the breadth of geodiversity in this themed issue, so Gray's [5] paper provides 10 case studies across different themes to give readers who are and are not well versed in geodiversity alike the chance to appreciate its geographic, practical and conceptual scope. All of the papers relate to sustainability in some way, but the contribution by van Ree et al. [6] tackles the topic directly, in relation to urban subsurface exploitation and its link to human wellbeing, highlighting insufficient frameworks for subsurface development and use, and suggesting ways forward. Elsewhere in the themed issue, you will see papers on the measurement and monitoring of geodiversity and biodiversity, and conservation. This includes presentation of geodiversity data for Europe at two spatial resolutions [7]; development of a framework for quantifying geodiversity at local scales [8]; integrating vegetation and geodiversity monitoring using remote sensing and traits [9]; and quantitatively assessing geodiversity uniqueness and applying this to biodiversity conservation [10]. Seijmonsbergen et al. [11] bridge geodiversity measurement and geoconservation by creating a global geodiversity map, which they use to assess the extent to which UNESCO Global Geoparks represent the different elements of geodiversity, finding some components are underrepresented. Such global geodiversity maps are also considered in the Amazon drainage basin, where no large-scale geodiversity assessment has previously taken place, with global maps being refined to ultimately define three principal regions within the basin [12]. Geodiversity–biodiversity relationships are addressed empirically in two papers. Gerstner et al. [13] highlight the importance of considering the resolution of geodiversity data for species distribution modelling. The validity of taking a Conserving Nature's Stage approach to biodiversity conservation is assessed by Miller et al. [14], who find that conserving geophysical characteristics as surrogate sites for biodiversity is an effective conservation approach. Elsewhere in a geoheritage and geoconservation context, Monge-Ganuzas et al. [15] describe geoconservation achievements within the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and offer further recommendations. Arid Quaternary geoheritage sites are specifically considered in the context of promoting inclusion and diversity as part of the assessment process [16], while the dilemma faced by many geoheritage sites of balancing protection with geotourism, including valuation of geodiversity, is tackled by Anougmar et al. [17]. Schrodt et al. [3] also provide an important update on EGVs and propose areas of focus to speed up development and further integration of EGVs across the scientific and policy communities. Our intention was always for this themed issue to encourage engagement with EGVs going forward. To achieve this, we collated current knowledge to provide an important learning resource around geodiversity, critically assess progress, raise awareness of the importance of geodiversity generally and specifically EGVs, and chart a course for interdisciplinary discussions around the importance of the Earth's geodiversity for sustainability, including biodiversity and the economy. We hope you enjoy it, and we look forward to developing these themes further. Data accessibility This article has no additional data.

NASA’s Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellite (level 3) provides ‘surface’ SM with 2–3 days temporal resolution, hence lacks daily and subsurface SM information. This study developed a convolutional neural network – long short-term memory (ConvLSTM) deep learning model to produce daily surface (5 cm) and subsurface (25 cm) SM products by integrating SMAP Level 3 ancillary data, North American Land Data Assimilation System Phase 2 (NLDAS-2) SM, and Soil Landscapes of the United States (SOLUS100) digital maps across the contiguous U.S. Two input scenarios were evaluated: scenario 1 used only SMAP ancillary data, and scenario 2 included both SMAP ancillary data and SOLUS100 soil maps. Model evaluation with in-situ SM data showed higher accuracy for scenario 2, indicating the importance of soil properties (texture and bulk density) in SM estimation. Coarse-textured soils showed the highest estimation accuracy, followed by medium- and fine-textured soils. The model also performed in estimating subsurface SM than surface SM for most land-cover types. Incorporating SMAP ancillary data and SOLUS100 digital soil maps into ConvLSTM improved surface and subsurface SM estimation. The results highlight the potential of deep learning for integrating multi-source multi-scale observations for improving SM estimation at large scale.","",https://doi.org/10.20944/preprints202412.1356.v1,"",,
rayyan-224216150,Assessing the impacts of land use and climate change on streamflow generation in the Nowrangpur catchment based on the SWAT-land-use update tool,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"ABSTRACT Climate change and land-use change are two major factors that affect the hydrologic response of a river basin. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) is a reliable method to model the hydrology of a river basin. The SWAT-land-use update tool offers a user-friendly interface for the incorporation of dynamic land-use changes into hydrological modeling. This paper evaluates the impacts of climate and dynamic land-use changes on the streamflow generation in the Nowrangpur catchment encompassing Indravati dam, which is a major water resources project in India. Calibrating the SWAT model involved updating land-use data from 1985 to 2015, yielding satisfactory results. The future land-use/land-cover changes were predicted using the cellular atomata-artificial neural network model. Downscaled general circulation model data from 10 climate models were utilized to predict climate change impacts up to 2100. Projections indicate increased precipitation during the months from August to December with a more pronounced increase in the mid and far future. An uptrend in maximum and minimum temperatures for all months is observed in the far future relative to the baseline period. Furthermore, the streamflow predictions indicate a near-future decrease in total annual streamflow, followed by an increase of up to 41% in the mid and far future.","",https://doi.org/10.2166/wcc.2024.265,"",,
rayyan-224216155,Estimating Rainfall Intensity Using an Image-Based Convolutional Neural Network Inversion Technique for Potential Crowdsourcing Applications in Urban Areas,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"High-quality rainfall data are essential in many water management problems, including stormwater management, water resources management, and more. Due to the high spatial–temporal variations, rainfall measurement could be challenging and costly, especially in urban areas. This could be even more challenging in tropical regions with their typical short-duration and high-intensity rainfall events, as some of the undeveloped or developing countries in those regions lack a dense rain gauge network and have limited resources to use radar and satellite readings. Thus, exploring alternative rainfall estimation methods could be helpful to back up some shortcomings. Recently, a few studies have examined the utilisation of citizen science methods to collect rainfall data as a complement to the existing rain gauge networks. However, these attempts are in the early stages, and limited works have been published on improving the quality of such data. Therefore, this study focuses on image-based rainfall estimation with potential usage in citizen science. For this, a novel convolutional neural network (CNN) model is developed to predict rainfall intensity by processing the images captured by citizens (e.g., by smartphones or security cameras) in an urban area. The developed model is merely a complementary sensing tool (e.g., better spatial coverage) to the existing rain gauge network in an urban area and is not meant to replace it. This study also presents one of the most extensive datasets of rain image data ever published in the literature. The estimated rainfall data by the proposed CNN model of this study using images captured by surveillance cameras and smartphone cameras are compared with observed rainfall by a weather station and exhibit strong R2 values of 0.955 and 0.840, respectively.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/bdcc8100126,"",,
rayyan-224216185,Integrating Graph Data Models in Advanced Water Resource Management: A New Paradigm for Complex Hydraulic Systems,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"The efficient management of water resources is crucial due to increasing environmental and societal pressures, requiring advanced data handling capabilities. Traditional relational data models, while foundational, struggle to capture the complex relationships inherent in water systems, limiting analytical and decision-making effectiveness. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a comprehensive graph data model for water resource management. Our model includes conceptual, logical, and physical frameworks that enable the structured representation of hydraulic objects and their relationships. We categorize hydraulic objects, examine their spatial, structural, and operational interconnections, and construct an adaptable graph data model. This model provides the enhanced integration, mining, and analysis of hydraulic data, supporting intelligent, data-driven water management applications. Example applications demonstrate the model’s utility in improving watershed management, hydropower scheduling, and uncovering latent relationships among hydraulic components through graph neural networks. This work establishes a robust data foundation for the sustainable and scientific management of water resources.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/w17010003,"",,

rayyan-224216206,"Flood Prediction by using Artificial Neural Network: A Case Study in Temerloh, Pahang",,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Floods are natural disasters that can cause significant property damage and sometimes result in loss of life. In Malaysia, floods occur every year, particularly on the East Coast of Peninsular Malaysia, due to the Northeast Monsoon and the impacts of climate change, which can lead to heavy rainfall at the end of the year. Temerloh, a district in Pahang, frequently experiences flooding events, especially between November and January. Despite various efforts in flood mitigation and preparation, the damage to both citizens and property each year results in costs amounting to thousands of Ringgits and the time needed to clean up the aftermath of floods. To address this issue, this research examined the hydrological and meteorological factors contributing to the floods in Temerloh and developed a machine-learning model capable of predicting future flood occurrences. The study utilized a dataset from the National Hydrological Network Management System (SPRHiN), which includes hydrological data and meteorological information for the specific location. The correlation analysis revealed a strong relationship between stream flow and water level to floods, with correlation coefficients (r values) of 0.83 and 0.76, respectively. In contrast, temperature exhibited an inverse relationship with floods, showing a correlation value of -0.28; this suggests that lower temperatures are associated with a higher likelihood of rain and subsequent flooding. The results indicated that the model, developed using an artificial neural network (ANN), achieved an impressive accuracy of 0.9909 and demonstrated strong performance, as evidenced by an area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) value of 0.888. The model also exhibited low error rates, with a mean squared error (MSE) of 0.009 and a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 0.096. Additionally, the R² value of 0.768 and the F1 score of 0.875 indicate that the model possesses high precision and recall. Furthermore, a flood monitoring dashboard was created to provide interactive data visualization. This research is essential for understanding the factors contributing to flooding in Pahang and will offer valuable insights for future studies on floods.","",https://doi.org/10.32388/tuz29y.3,"",,
rayyan-224216220,Perspective Chapter: Big Data and Deep Learning in Hydrological Modeling,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"This chapter delves into the integration of physical mechanisms with deep learning models to enhance the interpretability and accuracy of hydrological process modeling. In the era of big data and rapid advancements in AI, the synergy between traditional hydrological principles and machine learning opens new opportunities for improved water resource management, flood prediction, and drought monitoring. The chapter presents a comprehensive framework that leverages vast datasets from sources such as remote sensing, reanalysis data, and in situ monitoring. It explores the potential of deep learning models, particularly when combined with physical insights, to address challenges in data-scarce regions, improving the accuracy and transparency of predictions. By analyzing the strengths and limitations of current approaches, the study highlights the value of hybrid models in balancing accuracy and interpretability. These models not only enhance predictive performance but also provide more transparent insights into the underlying hydrological processes. This integration contributes to sustainable water management, disaster resilience, and climate adaptation, pushing forward both scientific progress and practical applications. The chapter offers valuable methodologies and case studies that underscore the importance of domain knowledge in the development of explainable and reliable predictive models, reshaping the future of hydrological forecasting.","",https://doi.org/10.5772/intechopen.1007640,"",,

Ensembled series are shown to outperform single-model assessments through increased consistency and stability. This study aims to test the improvement of precipitation estimates through the use of ensemble analysis for south and southwestern Turkey which is known to have complex climatic features due to varying topography and interacting climate forcings. The analysis covers an evaluation of the performance of eight regional climate models (RCMs) from the EUR-11 domain available from the CORDEX database. The historical outputs are evaluated for their representativeness of the current climate of the Mediterranean region and its surroundings in Turkey through a comparison with long-term monthly precipitation time series obtained from ground-based precipitation observations by the use of statistical performance indicators and Taylor diagrams. This is followed by a comparative evaluation of three ensemble methodologies, simple average of the models, multiple linear regression for superensemble, and artificial neural networks (ANN). The analysis results show that the overall performance of ensembled time series is better compared to individual RCMs. ANN generally provided the best performance when all RCMs are used as inputs. Improvement in the performance of ensembling due to the use of nonlinear models is further confirmed by fuzzy inference systems (FIS). Both ANN and FIS generated monthly precipitation time series with higher correlations with those of observations. However, extreme events are poorly represented in the ensembled time series, and this may result in inefficiency in the design of various water structures such as spillways and storm water drainage systems that are based on high return period events.","",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00521-024-09598-x,"",,
rayyan-224216231,"Artificial Neural Networks for Mapping Coastal Lagoon of Chilika Lake, India, Using Earth Observation Data",,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"This study presents the environmental mapping of the Chilika Lake coastal lagoon, India, using satellite images Landsat 8-9 OLI/TIRS processed using machine learning (ML) methods. The largest brackish water coastal lagoon in Asia, Chilika Lake, is a wetland of international importance included in the Ramsar site due to its rich biodiversity, productivity, and precious habitat for migrating birds and rare species. The vulnerable ecosystems of the Chilika Lagoon are subject to climate effects (monsoon effects) and anthropogenic activities (overexploitation through fishing and pollution by microplastics). Such environmental pressure results in the eutrophication of the lake, coastal erosion, fluctuations in size, and changes in land cover types in the surrounding landscapes. The habitat monitoring of the coastal lagoons is complex and difficult to implement with conventional Geographic Information System (GIS) methods. In particular, landscape variability, patch fragmentation, and landscape dynamics play a crucial role in environmental dynamics along the eastern coasts of the Bay of Bengal, which is strongly affected by the Indian monsoon system, which controls the precipitation pattern and ecosystem structure. To improve methods of environmental monitoring of coastal areas, this study employs the methods of ML and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), which present a powerful tool for computer vision, image classification, and analysis of Earth Observation (EO) data. Multispectral satellite data were processed by several ML image classification methods, including Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and the ANN-based MultiLayer Perceptron (MLP) Classifier. The results are compared and discussed. The ANN-based approach outperformed the other methods in terms of accuracy and precision of mapping. Ten land cover classes around the Chilika coastal lagoon were identified via spatio-temporal variations in land cover types from 2019 until 2024. This study provides ML-based maps implemented using Geographic Resources Analysis Support System (GRASS) GIS image analysis software and aims to support ML-based mapping approach of environmental processes over the Chilika Lake coastal lagoon, India.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/jmse12050709,"",,

For efficient water balance, ET remains the major component and its proper forecasting and quantifying is of the utmost importance. This study utilises the 18-year (2001 to 2018) MODIS ET obtained from a drought-affected irrigation scheme in the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa. This study conducts a teleconnection evaluation between the satellite-derived evapotranspiration (ET) time series and other related remotely sensed parameters such as the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalised Difference Water Index (NDWI), Normalised Difference Drought Index (NDDI), and precipitation (P). This comparative analysis was performed by adopting the Mann–Kendall (MK) test, Sequential Mann–Kendall (SQ-MK) test, and Multiple Linear Regression methods. Additionally, the ET detailed time-series analysis with the Keiskamma River streamflow (SF) and monthly volumes of the Sandile Dam, which are water supply sources close to the study area, was performed using the Wavelet Analysis, Breaks for Additive Seasonal and Trend (BFAST), Theil–Sen statistic, and Correlation statistics. The MODIS-obtained ET was then forecasted using the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) for a period of 5 years and four modelling performance evaluations such as the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and the Pearson Correlation Coefficient (R) were used to evaluate the model performances. The results of this study proved that ET could be forecasted using these two time-series modeling tools; however, the ARIMA modelling technique achieved lesser values according to the four statistical modelling techniques employed with the RMSE for the ARIMA = 37.58, over the ANN = 44.18; the MAE for the ARIMA = 32.37, over the ANN = 35.88; the MAPE for the ARIMA = 17.26, over the ANN = 24.26; and for the R ARIMA = 0.94 with the ANN = 0.86. These results are interesting as they give hope to water managers at the irrigation scheme and equally serve as a tool to effectively manage the irrigation scheme.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/hydrology11100176,"",,
rayyan-224216271,A deep learning model for real-time forecasting of 2-D river flood inundation maps,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract. Floods are among the most hazardous natural disasters worldwide. Accurate and rapid flood predictions are critical for effective early warning systems and flood management strategies. The high computational cost of hydrodynamic models often limits their application in real-time flood simulations. Conversely, data-driven models are gaining attention due to their high computational efficiency. In this study, we aim at assessing the effectiveness of transformer-based models for forecasting the spatiotemporal evolution of fluvial floods in real-time. To this end, the transformer-based data-driven model FloodSformer (FS) has been adapted to predict river flood inundations with negligible computational time. The FS model leverages an autoencoder framework to analyze and reduce the dimensionality of spatial information in input water depth maps, while a transformer architecture captures spatiotemporal correlations between inundation maps and inflow discharges using a cross-attention mechanism. The trained model can predict long-lasting events using an autoregressive procedure. The model's performance was evaluated in two case studies: an urban flash flood scenario at the laboratory scale and a river flood scenario along a segment of the Po River (Italy). Datasets were numerically generated using a two-dimensional hydrodynamic model. Special attention was given to analyzing how the accuracy of predictions is influenced by the type and severity of flood events used to create the training dataset. The results show that prediction errors generally align with the uncertainty observed in physically based models, and that larger and more diverse training datasets help improving the model's accuracy. Additionally, the computational time of the real-time forecasting procedure is negligible compared to the physical time of the simulated event. The performance of the FS model was also benchmarked against a state-of-the-art convolutional neural network architecture and showed better accuracy. These findings highlight the potential of transformer-based models in enhancing flood prediction accuracy and responsiveness, contributing to improve flood management and resilience.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-2024-176,"",,

Utilizing the advanced Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks–Dynamic Infrared Rain Rate near-real-time (PDIR-Now) dataset, the study covers a 23-year period from 2001 to 2023. The research aimed to determine runoff coefficients, which are critical for predicting how much rainfall contributes to surface runoff. Analysis of annual runoff volumes and rainfall data from 39 dams, divided into calibration and validation sets, led to a runoff coefficient of 0.059, indicating that 5.9% of rainfall contributes to runoff. The calibration process, validated by statistical measures such as mean bias (0.23 mm) and RMSE (0.94 mm), showed reasonable model accuracy but also highlighted areas for refinement. With an average annual rainfall of 89.6 mm, resulting in 1733.1 million cubic meters (mil. m3) of runoff, the study underscores the importance of localized calibration and ongoing model refinement to ensure sustainable water management in the face of environmental and climatic challenges.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/w16192743,"",,

Climate action as one of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) can only be achieved continuous study and understanding of our complex atmosphere. The dynamics of the atmosphere is a hot issue in research due to the random process or random probability distribution of the parameters associated with the environment, in which rain height is a key factor. Advanced Deep Learning (ADL) has achieved reasonable results in many fields and the associated applications, especially in the accurate prediction of time-series events. In this study, we adopted stochastic dynamical models to forecast Zero-Degree Isotherm Height (ZDIH) in Akure, a tropical region located in the Southwestern Nigeria. Existing methods, including traditional statistical approaches and ITU-R recommendations, have shown limited accuracy and generalizability due to their inability to capture intricate patterns in atmospheric data. One of the goals of this research is to identify gaps in the existing methods, such as their reliance on shallow learning techniques and their inadequacy in processing large volumes of data with high variability. This research proposes a new approach by applying the Seasonal AutoRegressive Moving Average (SARIMA) and two ADL models, namely; the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and the hybrid LSTM, referred to as Long Short-Term Memory - Convolutional Neural Network (LSTM-CNN) model. Six years (2005-2010) of archived data from the National Aeronautics Space Administration (NASA) are used for the prediction. The result shows seasonality and a fairly stable trend over the yearly analysis. The ZDIH is generally low throughout the rainy season with a mean value of 4.75 km while mean of 4.94 km was observed during the dry season. Validation and comparison of the models revealed that SARIMA (2, 1, 1)(1, 1, 1, 12) model has a better performance over the other two models with RMSE and r 2 of 46.3 and 0.89, respectively. The LSTM provides a fair performance, while the hybrid LSTM-CNN model performed poorly. The outcome of the research suspects the seasonality feature (i.e parameter “s”) of SARIMA could be responsible for its higher prediction accuracy over the ADL models. The results obtained demonstrate that the model significantly improves forecasting accuracy and it is hereby recommended for prediction of ZDIH the tropical region.","",https://doi.org/10.1088/1755-1315/1428/1/012017,"",,

It should be remembered that changing of climate has the potential to threaten the security of water, food and energy systems. One of the main problems causing this is improper water management. In this article, the effects of smart irrigation systems, which are a product of climate-smart agriculture and water management for the changing climate in the world, are reviewed in the literature and the effects of these systems on climate change are discussed. The aim of the study is to provide appropriate solutions against climate change. Water management is basically about being conscious of saving by making more use of irregularly used water resources and reducing wastage to zero in both agriculture and drinking water. Climate-friendly agriculture is practices that ensure sustainability in agriculture with climate resilience. Smart irrigation is a technological irrigation system applied to remotely control irrigation with artificial intelligence and minimize water waste.

The study examined the results of analyzing changes in land cover maps due to climate change and assessed vulnerability in water management areas until 2050. According to the analysis results, the regulations for our study areas were set lower than those for other water management zones, resulting in a high rate of urbanization.

Traditionally, empirical methods are used to calculate the reference evapotranspiration using available meteorological data. However, in many areas, such data is limited or unavailable for ET<sub>o</sub> estimation. Hence, this study aims to explore data-driven models like machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) for estimating ET<sub>o</sub> with minimal meteorological data. In this study, five ML models, including linear regression (LR), random forest (RF), support vector regression (SVR), XGBoost, KNN regression, and two deep learning methods such as feedforward neural networks and long-term short-term memory (LSTM), were used to estimate the reference evapotranspiration (ET<sub>o</sub>) over the Phulnahara canal command area using various combinations of meteorological parameters. The results of these models were compared with the Penman-Monteith-based ET<sub>o</sub>. The Penman-Monteith-based ET<sub>o</sub> exhibits a significant positive correlation with sunshine hour and maximum temperature, displaying correlation coefficients of 0.8 and 0.6, respectively, while RHmin and RHmax demonstrate a negative correlation. The findings revealed that when all climate data is available, the coefficient of determination (R<sup>2</sup>) rises to 0.98. However, when data is limited, it drops to 0.78. The SVR model outperformed other ML models with all input combinations. However, KNN emerged as the most reliable model for estimating ET<sub>o</sub> with input data of maximum and minimum temperature. Interestingly, we found that even using just three parameters (temperature, wind speed, and relative humidity) or two-parameter combinations (temperature and relative humidity or temperature and wind speed) can yield promising results in ET<sub>o</sub> estimation. The findings of this study offer valuable insights for estimating ET<sub>o</sub> in regions with limited climate data, which is crucial for effective agricultural water management.","",https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-4853172/v1,"",,
rayyan-224216429,A multi-resolution deep-learning surrogate framework for global hydrological models,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Global hydrological models (GHMs) are an important tool for sustainable development making in today&amp;#8217;s water-scarce world. These models enable assessment of water scarcity by estimating both the natural water cycle and human activities around the world. Moreover, their process-based structure allows for projections under diverse climate change and socio-economic scenarios; information that is essential to support sustainable water management. Nevertheless, the need for better, higher resolution and larger ensemble simulations is reaching the limit of what is computationally feasible.Recently, the deep-learning community has shown the potential of neural networks in providing highly accurate and computationally cheap hydrological predictions. This development has let to the emergence of deep-learning model surrogates that mimic process-based hydrological simulations using neural networks. Yet, the majority of these surrogates are restricted to assessing land-surface water fluxes at a singular spatial resolution, thereby limiting their application for global hydrological models.We present a novel framework to create deep-learning global hydrological surrogates, with two salient features. First, our surrogate framework integrates spatially-distributed runoff routing that is essential to estimate water availability and human water withdrawals. Second, our surrogate framework offers scalability across various spatial resolutions and can match the wide variety of resolutions at which global hydrological models are applied.To test our framework, we developed a deep-learning surrogate of the PCRaster Global Water Balance (PCR-GLOBWB) global hydrological model. The surrogate encompasses all water-balance components, including the impact of human activities on the water system. The PCR-GLOBWB surrogate runs faster than its process-based counterpart and performs well when compared to the original model&amp;#8217;s output at different spatial resolutions. Interestingly, the multi-resolution surrogate actually outperforms model surrogates trained for a single resolution, even on their target resolution.Deep-learning surrogates are a useful tool for the global hydrological modeling community, enabling enhanced model calibration (through parameter learning and flux matching) and more detailed model simulations. Our framework provides an excellent foundation for the community to create their own multi-scale deep-learning model surrogates.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu24-8537,"",,
rayyan-224216445,Reconstruction of Surface Water Temperature in Lakes as a Source for Long-Term Analysis of Its Changes,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"One of the key parameters of lakes is water temperature, which influences many physical and biochemical processes. In Poland, in situ temperature measurements are or have been conducted in only about 30 lakes, whereas there are over 3000 lakes with an area larger than 10 hectares. In many cases, the length of existing observation series is not always sufficient for long-term analysis. Using artificial neural networks of the multilayer perceptron network (MLP) type, the reconstruction of average monthly water temperatures was carried out for nine lakes located in northern Poland. During the validation stage of the reconstruction results, BIAS values were obtained in the range of −0.33 to 0.44 °C, the mean absolute error was 0.46 °C, and the root mean square error was 0.61 °C. The high quality of the reconstructed data allowed for an assessment of water temperature changes in the analyzed lakes from 1993 to 2022 using the Mann–Kendall and Sen tests. It was found that, on an annual basis, the water temperature increased by an average of 0.50 °C per decade, ranging from 0.36 °C per decade to 0.64 °C per decade for individual lakes. For specific months, the largest increase was observed in November, about 0.99 °C per decade, and the smallest in May, 0.07 °C per decade. The obtained results confirm previous studies in this field while adding new data from lakes, which are particularly significant for the western part of Poland—a region with a previously limited number of monitored lakes. According to the findings, the analyzed lakes have undergone significant warming over the past three decades, which is important information for water management authorities.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/w16233347,"",,

rayyan-224216475,Development of a Multi-Scale Groundwater Drought Prediction Model Using Deep Learning and Hydrometeorological Data,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Groundwater is an essential water resource and plays a crucial role, especially in areas with limited surface water availability. However, the exacerbation of groundwater droughts, fueled by phenomena such as climate change, urbanization, and industrialization, highlights the necessity for predictive tools to aid in sustainable groundwater management. While artificial neural networks (ANN) have been increasingly used for groundwater level prediction, most studies have focused solely on point-scale predictions from groundwater observation wells, which can be resource-intensive and time-consuming. In this study, we propose a multi-scale groundwater-based drought prediction model that can predict both zonal average values and the values at well locations for the standardized groundwater level index (SGI). Specifically, we develop a zone-scale SGI prediction model through long short-term memory (LSTM) and propose a model that can accurately predict point-scale SGI through a simple downscaling process. Our model was developed and tested for Jeju Island, a volcanic island in South Korea where groundwater serves as the primary water source. Specifically, we partitioned Jeju Island into 16 sub-watersheds, termed zones, and constructed an individual model for each zone. Forecasting the standardized groundwater level index (SGI) for each zone was based on input datasets including the daily temperature, precipitation, snowfall, vapor pressure deficit (VPD), wind speed, and preceding SGI values. Additionally, we downscaled the predicted values of each zone to the specific SGI values at groundwater monitoring wells within the zone. This was achieved by applying the spatial deviation of each well relative to the zonal mean over the preceding 4 days to the predicted zone-scale SGI value. Our findings indicate high accuracy of the model in SGI predictions across both scales, with the Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (NSE) exceeding 0.9 and the root mean square error (RMSE) remaining less than 0.3 for both the representative zone and observation well. By leveraging the proposed model, stakeholders and policymakers can efficiently generate and utilize both zone-scale and point-scale groundwater-based drought predictions, contributing to effective groundwater management practices.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/w16142036,"",,

Existing methods for studying water turbidity's spatial and temporal distribution rely mostly on measured data. There is limited research on the classification of water bodies with different turbidity levels. The main challenge lies in determining the boundaries of liquid water bodies at various turbidity levels, making it challenging to classify them accurately using traditional remote sensing image classification methods. This paper proposes and validates an intelligent turbidity classification method based on deep learning using GaoFen-1 multispectral remote sensing imagery. An adaptive threshold water extraction method based on the Normalized Difference Water Index is proposed to capture water boundaries more accurately to improve the accuracy of extracting nearshore water bodies. A semi-automatic semantic annotation method for water turbidity is introduced to reduce manual labeling costs. The paper applies mode filtering to address edge noise issues and establishes a high-quality training sample dataset. After comparing the accuracy of various neural network models, DeepLab V3+ is selected for intelligent turbidity classification. The results show high accuracy, with mean intersection over union (MIoU), mean F1 score (MF1), and overall accuracy (OA) reaching 94.73%, 97.29%, and 97.54%, respectively. The proposed method and experiments demonstrate the feasibility of intelligent classification of water bodies with different turbidity levels using deep learning networks.

Integrated management plans of water basins are of crucial importance since intensively cultivated areas are adding huge quantities of fertilizers to the soil, affecting surface water basins and groundwater. Aquifers are progressively being nitrified on account of the nitrogen-based fertilizer surplus, rendering water for human consumption not potable. Well-tested solute leaching models, standalone or part of a model package, provide rapid site-specific estimates of the leaching potential of chemical agents, mostly nitrates, below the root zone of crops and the impact of leaching toward groundwater. Most of the models examined were process-based or conceptual approaches. Nonetheless, empirical prediction models, though rather simplistic and therefore not preferrable, demonstrate certain advantages, such as less demanding extensive calibration database information requirements, which in many cases are unavailable, not to mention a stochastic approach and the involvement of artificial intelligence (AI). Models were categorized according to the porous medium and agents to be monitored.

Currently, soil moisture is typically measured by installing sensors in the ground or through satellite remote sensing, with data retrieval facilitated by reanalysis models such as the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Reanalysis 5 (ERA5) and the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS). However, the suitability of these methods for capturing local-scale variabilities is insufficiently validated, particularly in regions like South Korea, where land surfaces are highly complex and heterogeneous. In contrast, artificial intelligence (AI) approaches have shown promising potential for soil moisture retrieval at the local scale but have rarely demonstrated substantial products for spatially continuous grids. This paper presents the retrieval of daily soil moisture (SM) over a 500 m grid for croplands in South Korea using random forest (RF) and automated machine learning (AutoML) models, leveraging satellite images and meteorological data. In a blind test conducted for the years 2013–2019, the AutoML-based SM model demonstrated optimal performance, achieving a root mean square error of 2.713% and a correlation coefficient of 0.940. Furthermore, the performance of the AutoML model remained consistent across all the years and months, as well as under extreme weather conditions, indicating its reliability and stability. Comparing the soil moisture data derived from our AutoML model with the reanalysis data from sources such as the European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative (ESA CCI), GLDAS, the Local Data Assimilation and Prediction System (LDAPS), and ERA5 for the South Korea region reveals that our AutoML model provides a much better representation.

To overcome water stress, treated wastewater (TWW) is increasingly utilized for irrigation purpose to conserve available freshwater resources. There are several critical aspects affecting the suitability of TWW for irrigation including salinity which can have detrimental effects on crop yield and soil health. Therefore, this study aimed to develop a novel approach for TWW salinity prediction using artificial intelligent (AI) ensembled machine learning approach. In this regard, several water quality parameters of the TWW samples were collected through field investigation from the irrigation zones in Al-Hassa, Saudi Arabia, which were later assessed in the lab. The assessment involved measuring Temperature (T), pH, Oxidation Reduction Potential (ORP), Electrical Conductivity (EC), Total Dissolved Solids (TDS), and Salinity, through an Internet of Things (IoT) based system integrated with a real-time monitoring and a multiprobe device. Based on the descriptive statistics of the data and correlation obtained through the Pearson matrix, the models were formed for predicting salinity by using the Hammerstein-Wiener Model (HWM) and Support Vector Regression (SVR). The models’ performance was evaluated using several statistical indices including correlation coefficient (R), coefficient of determination (R 2 ), mean square error (MSE), and root mean square error (RMSE). The results revealed that the HWM-M3 model with its superior predictive capabilities achieved the best performance, with R 2 values of 82% and 77% in both training and testing stages.

The Kelani River Basin in Sri Lanka, covering only ~3.6% of the land but hosting over a quarter of its population and many industrial zones, is identified as the most polluted watershed in the country. This study used unsupervised learning (UL) and an indexing approach to identify potential industrial pollutant sources along the Kelani River. The UL results were compared with those obtained from a novel Industrial Pollution Index (IPI). Three latent variables related to industrial pollution were identified via Factor Analysis of monthly water quality data from 17 monitoring stations from 2016 to 2020.

Recent progress in artificial intelligence and the growing availability of water quality monitoring data provide opportunity for developing new prediction tools that can be used at multiple spatiotemporal scales. However, most data-driven machine-learning research focuses on annual or monthly predictions for large watersheds, and few studies have applied such techniques to smaller catchments and at sub-daily intervals. Here, we develop an event-scale water quality and runoff machine learning prediction tool centered on a dynamic time window of hourly precipitation with corresponding sub-daily hydrological responses. We used close-interval water quality and flow monitoring data from 4 small, tile-drained catchments in Iowa placed predominantly in row-crop agriculture and with drainage areas ranging from 2.1 to 4.6 km2. With this data, we generated, a stacked random forest event-based model (SREM) incorporating precipitation, evapotranspiration, short-term drought dynamics and catchment characteristics to predict the responses of water discharge and nitrate concentrations to precipitation events. We found that precipitation volume, intensity, and duration were the most important climate variables to predict total and peak discharge. However, drought indices such as PDSI, SPEI, and SPI were the most important climate drivers to predict nitrate-N concentration. Initial results across all catchments show satisfactory performance for simulating total and peak discharge and nitrate concentration (NSE of 0.69, 0.64, 0.68, respectively). In addition to our modeling results, we used the event-aggregated observation data to explore precipitation-runoff and concentration-discharge (C-Q) relationships across the catchments and found strong non-linear relationships for most of them.

Independent evaluations against SuomiNet GPS and Integrated Global Radiosonde Archive Version 2 (IGRA2) PWV products yielded root mean square error (RMSE) of 4.47 mm and 3.89 mm, respectively, with RMSE values ranging from 2.90 to 5.49 mm across various surface conditions. The dataset effectively captures both spatial and temporal PWV variations, allowing for precise examination of localized and abrupt changes in water vapor induced by extreme weather events. Representing a significant advancement in global terrestrial PWV monitoring, the MWRI PWV dataset provides an all-weather, high-precision data record that bridges gaps in global coverage of passive microwave-based terrestrial PWV observations. It is a valuable resource for atmospheric research, climate modeling, water cycle studies, and beyond. The dataset is available at: https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.26712709 (Xia et al., 2024).","",https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-2024-395,"",,
rayyan-224216915,Extended range forecasting of stream water temperature with deep learning models,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract. Stream water temperatures influence water quality with effects on aquatic biodiversity, drinking water provision, electricity production, agriculture, and recreation. Therefore, stakeholders would benefit from an operational forecasting service that would support timely action. Deep learning models are well-suited to provide probabilistic forecasts at individual stations of a monitoring network. Here we train and evaluate several state-of-the-art models using 10 years of data from 54 stations across Switzerland. Static catchment features, time of the year, meteorological observations from the past 64 days, and their ensemble forecasts for the following 32 days are included as predictors in the models to estimate daily maximum water temperature over the next 32 days. Results show that the Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) model performs best with a Continuous Rank Probability Score (CRPS) of 0.70 °C averaged over all lead times, stations, and 90 forecasts distributed over 1 year. The TFT is followed by the Recurrent Neural Network Encoder – Decoder with a CRPS of 0.74 °C, and the Neural Hierarchical Interpolation for Time Series with a CRPS of 0.75 °C. These deep learning models outperform other simpler models trained at each station: Random Forest (CRPS = 0.80 °C), Multi-layer Perceptron neural network (CRPS = 0.81 °C), and Autoregressive linear model (CRPS = 0.96 °C). The average CRPS of the TFT degrades from 0.38 °C at lead time of 1 day to 0.90 °C at lead time of 32 days, largely driven by the uncertainty of the meteorological ensemble forecasts. In addition, TFT water temperature predictions at new and ungauged stations outperform those from the other models. When analyzing the importance of model inputs, we find a dominant role of observed water temperature and future air temperature, while including precipitation and time of the year further improve predictive skill. Operational probabilistic forecasts of daily maximum water temperature are generated twice per week with our TFT model and are publicly available at https://www.drought.ch/de/impakt-vorhersagen-malefix/wassertemperatur-prognosen/. Overall, this study provides insights on the extended range predictability of stream water temperature, and on the applicability of deep learning models in hydrology.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-2591,"",,
rayyan-224216920,Dual-Transformer Deep Learning Framework for Seasonal Forecasting of Great Lakes Water Levels,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"The Great Lakes of North America form one of the largest freshwater systems on Earth, exhibiting seasonal water level fluctuations that exceed 0.5 meters. These fluctuations pose substantial challenges for coastal resilience, flood risk management, and navigation planning. Accurate seasonal forecasting of lake levels using traditional mechanistic models is challenging due to the complex physical mechanisms and coupled hydroclimatic processes involved. Recently, deep learning has gained prominence in geoscience applications for its ability to recognize intricate patterns within multiphysical datasets. Here, we introduce a novel Dual-Transformer deep learning framework, tested on Lake Superior—the largest of the five Great Lakes. This architecture integrates two modified Transformer models: the Prophet, which predicts underlying trends, and the Critic, which refines the Prophet's predictions. The final lake level prediction is derived by weighting the outputs of both models through a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), jointly trained with the Prophet and Critic to enhance overall accuracy. Our results demonstrate that the Dual-Transformer model, which uses seven atmospheric and lake features, achieves unprecedented accuracy in seasonal forecasting in the testing dataset, attaining a correlation coefficient of 0.97 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 4 cm for forecasts up to six months ahead. Additionally, the Dual-Transformer model runs six orders of magnitude faster than conventional mechanistic models, producing results in less than one second on a typical personal computer. These findings suggest our deep learning framework provides an efficient and reliable tool for real-time lake level forecasting, with significant implications for water management and disaster mitigation.","",https://doi.org/10.22541/essoar.173193335.58250588/v1,"",,

  Swin-Unet with Applications to Area Prediction",,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Lakes provide a wide range of valuable ecosystem services, such as water supply, biodiversity habitats, and carbon sequestration. However, lakes are increasingly threatened by climate change and human activities. Therefore, continuous global monitoring of lake dynamics is crucial, but remains challenging on a large scale. The recently developed Global Lakes Area Database (GLAKES) has mapped over 3.4 million lakes worldwide, but it only provides data at decadal intervals, which may be insufficient to capture rapid or short-term changes.This paper introduces an expanded lake database, GLAKES-Additional, which offers biennial delineations and area measurements for 152,567 lakes globally from 1990 to 2021. We employed the Swin-Unet model, replacing traditional convolution operations, to effectively address the challenges posed by the receptive field requirements of high spatial resolution satellite imagery. The increased biennial time resolution helps to quantitatively attribute lake area changes to climatic and hydrological drivers, such as precipitation and temperature changes.For predicting lake area changes, we used a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network and an extended time series dataset for preliminary modeling. Under climate and land use scenarios, our model achieved an RMSE of 0.317 km^2 in predicting future lake area changes.","",https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2408.10821,"",,
rayyan-224216938,"Trees, society, and the path toward resilient ecosystems",,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Over 3 trillion trees occupy the Earth's land surface, mostly in tropical and subtropical forests. These trees provide vital ecosystem services, such as climate regulation, carbon sequestration, and habitat and food provision. Trees are also deeply interconnected with humans, offering social and cultural values. The interdependence between trees and humans underlines the urgency to understand and protect trees in both natural and urban ecosystems amid climate change and other environmental pressures, including deforestation, land degradation, and pollution. This virtual issue examines five critical themes of trees and forests and their societal impact. Over 3 trillion trees occupy the Earth's land surface, mostly in tropical and subtropical forests (~1.3 trillion) (Crowther et al., 2015). These trees provide vital ecosystem services, such as climate regulation, carbon sequestration, and habitat and food provision (Brockerhoff et al., 2017; Myers, 1997). Trees are also deeply interconnected with humans, offering social and cultural values (O'Brien, 2005). The interdependence between trees and humans underlines the urgency to understand and protect trees in both natural and urban ecosystems amid climate change and other environmental pressures, including deforestation, land degradation, and pollution (De Marco et al., 2022; Esperon-Rodriguez, Tjoelker, et al., 2022; Kumar et al., 2022; Lindner et al., 2010). This virtual issue examines five critical themes of trees and forests and their societal impact. Each theme provides insights into cultural significance, ecosystem contributions, resilience and restoration, and technological innovations in conservation. In 'Climate Resilience and Adaptive Strategies of Trees', researchers investigate how trees adapt to climate change through resilience and genetic diversity with studies on urban forest adaptation, genetic variation, and seasonal responses of tree species. 'Forest Restoration and Biodiversity Conservation' shows strategies that enhance biodiversity and climate mitigation with diverse reforestation practices. In 'Trees and Human Culture', the research explores the cultural value of trees, focusing on the historical and societal importance of native and commercial species and their role in local traditions and economies. The authors of work featured in 'Trees as Ecosystem Engineers' highlight how trees contribute to biodiversity and support livelihoods, with studies on societal perceptions, species interactions, and endemic conservation efforts. Lastly, 'Technological Advances in Forest Monitoring and Conservation' delves into tools like UAVs and genetic analyses that aid in monitoring and preserving forests. Together, these themes offer a comprehensive view of trees' essential roles across ecosystems, human culture, and emerging conservation efforts. As a response to climate change and urbanization, researchers highlight the need to enhance urban forest resilience. Urban forests, essential for decreasing urban heat and improving air quality and human well-being (Keeler et al., 2019), face risks from climate-induced stress. To secure the provision of these benefits to urban residents, Esperon-Rodriguez, Rymer, et al. (2022) emphasize the importance of selecting tree species suited to the projected climate conditions in cities along with other desirable characteristics, such as aesthetic value and biodiversity support. By assessing the risks to heat, drought, and pest outbreaks, urban planners can make informed decisions to increase the longevity of urban trees and secure the services they provide (Esperon-Rodriguez, Rymer, et al., 2022). Urban environments present unique challenges and opportunities for tree resilience. Sjöman et al. (2024) examined how genetic diversity within tree species (i.e., intraspecific variation) supports resilience to urban stresses, such as pollution and limited water availability. The authors suggest that by focusing on resilient tree varieties, urban forestry initiatives can improve biodiversity and ecosystem function within cities, fostering healthier urban landscapes that also contribute to climate resilience. Species, however, respond differently to local environmental conditions. For example, Goessen et al. (2022) explored how tree species have diverse adaptations driven by geographic conditions. Their study focused on Populus tremuloides, or Quaking aspen, a species native to North America, has developed divergent strategies in response to local environmental constraints, reflecting the role of genetic diversity in resilience. In Japan, Miyawaki-Kuwakado et al. (2024) investigated how warming temperatures affect the timing of seasonal events like bud dormancy. Their research on the iconic Yoshino cherry tree (Cerasus × yedoensis) showed that climate change may lead to mistimed flowering. Such shifts threaten species reliant on specific climatic triggers, raising concerns about the long-term viability of temperature-sensitive species in changing climates. Importantly, these changes can also have socio-economic disruptions, as the blossoming of cherries is an important tourism resource (Murata et al., 2012). Similar results were found in the Singapore Botanic Gardens, where Ho et al. (2024) conducted a long-term assessment of changes in leafing behavior of tropical trees in response to climate change. They found that tropical trees can adjust their leafing behavior over extended periods, showcasing their adaptive capacity. By focusing on adaptive capacity, genetic diversity, and optimal species selection, this research offers pathways to enhance forest resilience and sustain the ecological and social benefits that trees provide. Forest restoration plays a critical role in climate change mitigation and biodiversity conservation as global efforts aim to reverse deforestation and land degradation (Bastin et al., 2019). Andres et al. (2023) sought to define the term ""biodiverse reforestation"" and explained why this matters for climate change mitigation and biodiversity. The authors emphasize the importance of integrating biodiversity goals into reforestation efforts. By prioritizing species diversity, reforestation projects can sequester carbon more effectively while supporting ecosystem functions and species. This represents a more resilient and sustainable approach to forest restoration. Importantly, the authors consider the potential for improving scientific approaches to biodiverse reforestation with First Nations perspectives. The co-benefits of Indigenous knowledge and values have been recognized as vital to climate adaptation (Nursey-Bray et al., 2022). In restoration, ensuring water efficiency in seedlings is crucial, especially under climate stress. Krishnan et al. (2023) examined how organic nitrogen can enhance water-use efficiency in tropical tree seedlings. They showed that nutrient addition allowed seedlings to establish more effectively under dry conditions, suggesting practical strategies for forest restoration projects in arid regions. This has important repercussions not only for restoration but also for food production. For example, in regions where food security and forest health are closely linked, selecting appropriate tree species is essential. A study in Burkina Faso, West Africa, by Vinceti et al. (2022) explored how tree species contribute to both ecological restoration and local nutrition. By including species that provide food, like fruit-bearing trees, reforestation initiatives in Burkina Faso can address both environmental and community needs, creating landscapes that support biodiversity while improving food security. Local and small-scale efforts, such as home gardens, also play a significant role in supporting biodiversity and for conservation. Offord and Zimmer (2024) studied how home gardeners help preserve the critically endangered Wollemi Pine (Wollemia nobilis). This species native to Australia was described as new to science in 1994 and is represented by fewer than 100 individuals (Trueman et al., 2007). By cultivating Wollemi Pine in private gardens, individuals contribute to broader conservation goals, ensuring genetic diversity and supporting efforts to reintroduce the species into its natural habitat (Offord & Zimmer, 2024). This approach highlights the value of community-based conservation in supporting endangered species and enhancing biodiversity. Trees and forests have profound cultural and economic value, reflecting centuries of human interaction and local knowledge (O'Brien, 2005). Recent research investigates the cultural, economic, and social significance of tree species, focusing on the importance of identity, naming, and preservation of species. Dunbar-Wallis et al. (2023) highlight the significance of preserving historic North American apple (Malus domestica) varieties. Their study showed how naming and identifying these apples maintain cultural heritage and biodiversity. North American apples represent historical practices and tastes, underscoring the importance of preserving these genetic resources as part of local identity and resilience. Notably, M. domestica is one of the most cultivated fruits worldwide (ranked fourth) with an average annual production of over 85 million tons globally (FAOSTAT, 2020). For the wild apple (Malus sylvestris), Ruhsam et al. (2023) took the challenge of accurately identifying the nursery stock sold in nurseries from the United Kingdom. Wild apple species are vital for genetic diversity and resilience, and ensuring authenticity in nursery stock is crucial for conservation. This research highlights the importance of preserving genetic integrity and maintaining access to wild species, which are valuable for both biodiversity and cultural heritage. Studying a culturally significant species, the barnī date palm variety, a local elite variety of al-'Ulā oasis in Saudi Arabia, Gros-Balthazard et al. (2023) found that this variety is not only an economic staple but also a cultural icon in the region. Through its name and cultivation, the barnī date palm represents a rich heritage that has sustained communities for generations, illustrating how plant varieties can embody place-based knowledge and cultural ties. In a similar study, Gurung et al. (2024) explored the cultural and medicinal significance of Buddleja asiatica, a shrub native to the East Indies. In the Pan-Himalayan region, this species is integral to local healthcare practices, providing essential medicinal benefits to communities. Its use reflects a traditional knowledge system and highlights the symbiotic relationship between people and native plant species, demonstrating the role of trees in supporting cultural identity and local health. Trees as ecosystem engineers (i.e., organisms responsible for the creation and maintenance of habitats; Jones et al., 1996) can change the abiotic context upon which biotic interactions depend (Byers et al., 2006). Thus, community livelihoods rely on identifying threats and benefits provided by trees. Tsvuura et al. (2023) explored gender perspectives on the perceived benefits and threats of tree restoration in South Africa. They explored how communities view trees as valuable contributors to their livelihoods, recognizing the critical role trees play in providing resources such as timber, fruit, and medicinal products. However, this study also highlights concerns regarding threats to these benefits, such as climate change, deforestation, and urbanization. These threats challenge the sustainability of the services that communities depend on, underscoring the need for strategies that secure tree resources while balancing conservation and economic needs (Sivakumar et al., 2024). In Yemen, Maděra et al. (2024) studied 11 endemic frankincense tree (Boswellia) taxa in the Socotra Archipelago. These species are culturally and economically valuable to local communities. However, frankincense trees are also threatened by overharvesting, habitat loss, and climate change, threatening local biodiversity and the communities reliant on them for livelihood. Maděra et al.'s study provides a detailed ecological assessment identifying regions at most risk and offers insights into conservation strategies that balance sustainable use with the preservation of genetic diversity. The conservation of frankincense trees is critical not only for the ecosystem but also for supporting traditional practices and economic stability for people in the region. As hosts for other species, trees can develop complex interactions, such as the relationship between strangler figs and their host trees, studied by Mo et al. (2024). Strangler figs start life on host trees, gradually growing and often overtaking the host tree's structure. While this interaction may seem parasitic, it can enhance urban green spaces by adding unique biodiversity and aesthetic value. This study suggests that, when managed properly, strangler figs can enrich urban ecosystems by creating microhabitats for multiple species, supporting urban biodiversity, and improving the resilience of green spaces (Mo et al., 2024). This research highlights the dual ecological and cultural significance of these trees in urban landscapes. Modern technologies like AI, UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles), and genetic tools are shaping a new era in the conservation, management, and monitoring of forests worldwide. By combining UAV surveys, genetic analysis, advanced forestry tools, and ground-based monitoring, researchers and managers can make informed decisions about forest conservation and sustainable use. These technologies not only improve our understanding of forest ecosystems but also facilitate enforcing regulations, planning conservation strategies, and adapting to climate change impacts on forests. In Madagascar, Williams (2024) used UAVs to monitor deforestation in real-time. Madagascar harbors a unique biodiversity, but this is threatened by illegal logging (Ralimanana et al., 2022). UAVs enable rapid, cost-effective detection of deforestation, offering precise data on forest loss and allowing authorities to respond promptly to illegal activities (Williams, 2024). In a global review of emerging tools to support sustainable forestry, Bunney et al. (2023) focused on protecting sandalwood species (a variety of species in the family Santalaceae), which are culturally and economically valuable and threatened by overharvesting. This review examined different methods, including DNA barcoding, to verify the species of harvested wood and remote sensing for forest monitoring. Together, these studies demonstrate the importance of combining drones, remote sensing, and genetic tools for comprehensive forest conservation strategies. The role of genomics in understanding the resilience of tree species was studied by Kong et al. (2023). Prosopis alba, native to arid environments, possesses genetic traits that allow it to withstand extreme drought and saline conditions. By mapping the genome of P. alba, Kong et al. demonstrated species adaptability, which can inform breeding programs aimed at enhancing the resilience of trees in regions facing water scarcity and climate stress. Genomic tools enable targeted conservation of tree species that are vital to ecosystem stability in extreme climates (Isabel et al., 2020). Finally, in a study using ground-based data, Anderson-Teixeira et al. (2024) showed that effective forest carbon inventories require precise measurements of carbon stocks. Technologies such as remote sensing paired with field data can provide reliable estimates. This approach enhances the accuracy of reporting forest carbon, helping countries meet their climate goals and track the effectiveness of conservation efforts. Collectively, these studies show the essential roles that trees play in both natural and urban environments, particularly in the face of climate change and environmental pressures. They reveal how trees adapt to climate changes, underscoring the importance of genetic diversity and adaptive strategies to strengthen climate-resilient forestry. This knowledge supports informed species selection and management to foster resilient forests that benefit both ecosystems and communities. A multi-faceted approach to forest restoration, one that incorporates ecological, cultural, and social factors, emerges as crucial for sustaining biodiversity while meeting community needs. These studies highlight trees as cultural symbols and economic resources, essential for preserving cultural identity and biodiversity. Trees also serve as ecosystem engineers, offering ecosystem services that support biodiversity, air quality, and water regulation, while facing significant threats from human impact. Notably, technological advancements and emerging tools are transforming forest conservation and monitoring, providing researchers with tools to better protect and manage forest ecosystems. Together, these studies provide insights and innovations toward more sustainable and resilient ecosystems that benefit both the environment and society. MER wrote this article.

It is essential to explore the current status of water use patterns and future development directions in Zhangye City. In this study, 17 factors affecting water consumption in Zhangye City were selected to analyze changes in water consumption and to predict values from 2003 to 2022, utilizing the entropy weight–VIKOR model and the grey neural network model. The results indicate that agricultural water consumption and annual rainfall are the factors with the largest weights among the social and natural attribute indicators, respectively, significantly influencing water consumption in Zhangye City. As the proportions of water consumption for forestry, animal husbandry, fishery, livestock, urban public use, and ecological environment increase, while agricultural water consumption continues to decline, the overall water consumption trend in Zhangye City from 2003 to 2022 shows a positive trajectory. Each water consumption factor is tending toward greater balance, and the relationship between water supply and distribution is improving. The multi-year average relative error of the water consumption predictions for Zhangye City from 2003 to 2022 using the grey neural network model was 4.28%. Furthermore, the relative error values for annual predictions ranged from 0.60% to 5.00%, achieving an accuracy rate of 80.00%. This indicates a strong predictive performance. Ultimately, the model was used to predict a water consumption of 20.18 × 108 m3 in Zhangye City in 2027. The model can serve as a theoretical reference for short-term water consumption forecasting and for establishing a basin water resource allocation system in Zhangye City.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/atmos15111387,"",,

However, the lack of adequate infrastructure to prevent and predict floods exacerbates this situation. The absence of early warning systems, the scarcity of meteorological and hydrological monitoring stations, and deficiencies in urban planning contribute to the vulnerability of communities to these phenomena. It is imperative to invest in flood prediction and prevention infrastructure, including advanced monitoring systems, the development of hydrological prediction models, and the construction of hydraulic infrastructure, to reduce risk and protect vulnerable communities in Chocó. Additionally, raising public awareness of the associated risks and encouraging the adoption of mitigation and preparedness measures throughout the population are essential. This study introduces a novel approach for the multivariate prediction of hydrological variables, specifically focusing on water level forecasts for two hydrological stations along the Atrato River in Colombia. The model, utilizing a specialized type of recurrent neural network (RNN) called the long short-term memory (LSTM) network, integrates data from hydrological variables, such as the flow, precipitation, and level. With a model architecture featuring four inputs and two outputs, where flow and precipitation serve as inputs and the level serves as the output for each station, the LSTM model is adept at capturing the complex dynamics and cross-correlations among these variables. Validation involves comparing the LSTM model’s performance with linear and nonlinear Autoregressive with Exogenous Input (NARX) models, considering factors such as the estimation error and computational time. Furthermore, this study explores different scenarios for water level prediction, aiming to utilize the proposed approach as an effective flood early warning system.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/info15060358,"",,
rayyan-224217058,Toward Field Scale Groundwater Withdrawals in the Western U.S. using Remote Sensing and Climate Data,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"In the Western U.S., the combination of increased and projected droughts, rising irrigation water demands, and population growth is expected to intensify groundwater consumption leading to adverse consequences like land subsidence and aquifer depletion. Despite the urgent need to address these challenges, there is limited local-scale monitoring of groundwater withdrawals in most of the groundwater basins in this region. Understanding the volume of groundwater being withdrawn is indispensable for implementing sustainable solutions to tackle water security issues. Hence, developing reliable and efficient groundwater withdrawal monitoring solutions is critical to address the pressing water management concerns in this region. The existing methods for estimating groundwater withdrawals are either costly and time-consuming, or they cannot generate dependable predictions at the scales required for effective local management. While our earlier works on integrating remote sensing and machine learning techniques to estimate gridded (1-5 km) groundwater use in Kansas, Arizona, and the Mississippi Alluvial Plain have been successful, field-scale estimation is still a challenge. Here, we use statistical and machine learning-based approaches to relate field-scale groundwater withdrawals with remote sensing-derived datasets, e.g., Landsat evapotranspiration (ET), downscaled SMAP surface soil moisture, and other hydrometeorological datasets for several Western U.S. states. We apply and test our approach by estimating and comparing groundwater pumping measurements at field- and regional-scales for multiple groundwater basins. Preliminary results using linear regression and machine learning-based approaches in Nevada and Arizona show promise (R2 of 0.5 to 0.7), additional in-situ pumping data actively being compiled will likely improve the models. While there are clear opportunities for model improvements, modeled withdrawal estimates are likely more accurate than common water right duties and potential crop ET-based estimates. We aim to enable water resource and user communities better understand water use, water budgets and support field-scale management practices for metered and unmetered groundwater basins.","",https://doi.org/10.22541/essoar.170688858.81127989/v1,"",,
rayyan-224217106,Hydrology on Solid Grounds? Integration Is Key to Closing Knowledge Gaps Concerning Landscape Subsurface Water Storage Dynamics,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"ABSTRACT Individual approaches to observe water dynamics across our landscape, from the land surface to groundwater, are many though they individually only provide glimpses into the real world due to their specific space–time scales. Comprehensive integration across all available observations is still largely lacking, limiting both our ability to reduce scientific knowledge gaps, and to guide land and water management using the best available scientific evidence. We argue that a stronger focus on integration of observational products, while utilising machine learning and accounting for current perceptual understanding is urgently needed to overcome this limitation. Since Europe is warming faster than any other continent, central Europe is undergoing a dramatic hydroclimatic transition about which such integrated observations would provide timely and valuable insights. Here, we present potential and gaps of current and planned observational methods. We argue that hyperresolution (sub km) integrated estimates of landscape water dynamics are feasible, which could significantly improve our ability to simulate vadose zone and groundwater dynamics, ultimately closing gaps in our current perception of hydrological processes in a temperate region under strong influence from climate change. We close by arguing that an interdisciplinary effort of various scientific communities is needed to enable this advancement.","",https://doi.org/10.1002/hyp.15320,"",,

Understanding these changes requires comprehensive monitoring of water resources. Hydrogeodesy, the science that measures the Earth's solid and aquatic surfaces, gravity field, and their changes over time, delivers a range of novel monitoring tools that are complementary to traditional hydrological methods. It encompasses geodetic technologies such as Altimetry, Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR), Gravimetry, and Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS). Beyond quantifying these changes, there is a need to understand how hydrogeodesy can contribute to more ambitious goals dealing with water‐related and sustainability sciences. Addressing this need, we combine a meta‐analysis of over 3,000 articles to chart the range, trends, and applications of satellite‐based hydrogeodesy with an expert elicitation that systematically assesses the potential of hydrogeodesy. We find a growing body of literature relating to the advancements in hydrogeodetic methods, their accuracy and precision, and their inclusion in hydrological modeling, with a considerably smaller portion related to understanding hydrological processes, water management, and sustainability sciences. The meta‐analysis also shows that while lakes, groundwater and glaciers are commonly monitored by these technologies, wetlands or permafrost could benefit from a wider range of applications. In turn, the expert elicitation envisages the potential of hydrogeodesy to help solve the 23 Unsolved Questions of the International Association of Hydrological Sciences and advance knowledge as guidance toward a safe operating space for humanity. It also highlights how this potential can be maximized by combining hydrogeodetic technologies simultaneously, exploiting artificial intelligence, and accurately integrating other Earth science disciplines. Finally, we call for a coordinated way forward to include hydrogeodesy in tertiary education and broaden its application to water‐related and sustainability sciences in order to exploit its full potential.","",https://doi.org/10.1029/2023wr037020,"",,
rayyan-224217212,Using Random Forests to Explore the Feasibility of Groundwater Knowledge Transfer between the Contiguous US and Denmark,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract Groundwater is our largest freshwater reservoir, playing an important role in the global hydrologic cycle. Lack of reliable groundwater data restricts the development of global groundwater monitoring systems linking observations with modeling at spatial scales relevant for local decision making. Despite the growing interests in machine learning (ML) for groundwater resource modeling, taking ML models to the global scale is still outstanding due to sparse groundwater data. The contiguous US (CONUS) has extensive groundwater information covering a wide range of hydrogeologic settings. We hypothesize that a ML model trained on the CONUS is transferable to other regions, and thus can be used to produce a global water table depth (WTD) map within the bounds of transferability. To test this hypothesis, we conduct a study on transferring groundwater knowledge between the CONUS and Denmark, using several random forest models trained against ~ 30m resolution long-term mean WTD data. The joint model trained on data from the CONUS and Denmark outperforms the individual models trained separately, implying similarities within global groundwater systems. The largest improvement occurs in Denmark, where the testing Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency rises from 0.68 to 0.95. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values are utilized to express the importance of input variables. While annual mean precipitation plays a key role in the joint model and the model for the CONUS, it is the second least important input variable in the model for Denmark where local processes dominate. Moreover, Köppen-Geiger climate classification shows a significant impact on the model testing performance and the importance ranking of input variables, which might be a missing input variable in the applied random forest models. This study provides unique insights into future ML model developments towards global groundwater monitoring and improves our confidence in producing a hyper-resolution global WTD map for sustainable freshwater management.","",https://doi.org/10.1088/2515-7620/ad9b08,"",,
rayyan-224217214,Forecasting water resources from satellite image time series using a graph-based learning strategy,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract. In the context of climate change, it is important to monitor the dynamics of the Earth’s surface in order to prevent extreme weather phenomena such as floods and droughts. To this end, global meteorological forecasting is constantly being improved, with a recent breakthrough in deep learning methods. In this paper, we propose to adapt a recent weather forecasting architecture, called GraphCast, to a water resources forecasting task using high-resolution satellite image time series (SITS). Based on an intermediate mesh, the data geometry used within the network is adapted to match high spatial resolution data acquired in two-dimensional space. In particular, we introduce a predefined irregular mesh based on a segmentation map to guide the network’s predictions and bring more detail to specific areas. We conduct experiments to forecast water resources index two months ahead on lakes and rivers in Italy and Spain. We demonstrate that our adaptation of GraphCast outperforms the existing frameworks designed for SITS analysis. It also showed stable results for the main hyperparameter, i.e., the number of superpixels. We conclude that adapting global meteorological forecasting methods to SITS settings can be beneficial for high spatial resolution predictions.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/isprs-archives-xlviii-2-2024-81-2024,"",,

Claussen M. et al.The deglacial forest conundrum.Nat.

The climate during the last glacial maximum period (22–19 ka BP [thousands of years before present]) was cold, followed by a significant warming from 19 to 12.9 ka BP, after which the cold period of the Younger Dryas (12.9–11.5 ka BP) occurred (Figures 1Aa–1Ag). Consequently, the simulated forest cover in the NH responded rapidly, experiencing a sharp increase from 18 ka and peaking at approximately 11 ka BP, albeit with a temporary decline during the cold Younger Dryas event. Subsequently, forest cover continuously declined throughout the Holocene (11.5 ka BP to present) (Figure 1Ah). In comparison, the pollen-based reconstructions of forest cover in the NH exhibited a notably different pattern. There was minimal discernible change during 19–12.9 ka BP, followed by a gradual and sustained increase culminating around 7 ka BP, with a gradual decline from 2 ka BP onwards (Figure 1Ai). Forest cover from model simulations and pollen reconstructions do not align with the climate change, and this phenomenon is referred to as the ""deglacial forest conundrum.""1Dallmeyer A. Kleinen T. Claussen M. et al.The deglacial forest conundrum.Nat.

Commun. 2022; 13: 6035https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-33646-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar Factors such as solar radiation, ice cover, and atmospheric carbon dioxide levels have been identified as the primary influencers of temperature and precipitation fluctuations in the NH, which, in turn, have a substantial influence on large-scale forest cover dynamics. However, they are insufficient to interpret the continental difference raised above. The underlying drivers responsible for this intriguing divergence in the response patterns of forest cover across individual continents remain a challenging scientific inquiry that warrants a thorough investigation. Here, we investigated soil moisture as a potential solution to the deglacial forest conundrum. The establishment and growth of forest are more sensitive to soil moisture than precipitation, especially in drought-restricted areas. Based on the high-resolution global woody cover data obtained from Earth observation satellite products, we found that forest cover had a much stronger correlation with soil moisture over Asia than over Europe and North America (Figures 1B and 1C), particularly for sites where the climate conditions are similar to those of the past (i.e., temperatures between 15°C and 26°C, as suggested by Figure 1Ac). Such a relationship is also supported by the modeled soil moisture and reconstructed forest cover for the period of 12.9–7 ka BP, when there was a rapid increase in reconstructed forest cover (Figures 1Ag, 1Ai, and 1C). Although soil moisture can be affected by precipitation, we observed a slightly weaker correlation between forest cover and precipitation compared to the relationship with soil moisture (Figure 1C). There was a much weaker correlation for temperature (Figure 1C). These differences in the strengths of correlations were not observed in Europe or North America. Soil moisture could buffer or decrease the forest cover under the dramatic climate change since the Last Glacial Maximum (Figures 1Ag and Ai). Evidently, many of the pollen-based forest reconstructions did not show a rapid response to the deglacial climate change (Figures 1Aa–1Af and 1Ai). This phenomenon possibly resulted from the soil moisture-temperature relationship, with an increase in temperature intensifying evaporation, ultimately promoting evapotranspiration and leading to a decrease in soil moisture (Figures 1Ac, 1Ae, and 1Ag). Hence, during the deglacial period, climate warming failed to trigger a substantial increase in forest cover during 19–12.9 ka BP due to the soil-regulating effect (Figures 1Ac, 1Ae, 1Ag, and 1Ai). This phenomenon was particularly pronounced during the rapid warming period between 15 and 12.9 ka BP. During the Holocene, temperature decreased from 11.5 ka BP onwards, while reconstructed forest cover peaked around 7 ka BP and then gradually decreased. These unsynchronized changes in temperature and forest cover imply that the increasing precipitation and soil moisture might co-determine the changes in forest cover during the Holocene (Figures 1Ac–1Ag and 1Ai). In contrast, the simulated forest cover kept almost the same pace as the changes in temperature and precipitation from 19 ka BP onwards (Figures 1Ac–1Af and 1Ah). Therefore, soil moisture could be the underlying factor controlling the evolution of forest cover in Asia since the Last Glacial Maximum. Forest cover is highly dependent on soil moisture. The root system of trees must absorb soil water, which is the most direct and fundamental water source for forest growth and distribution.2Miguez-Macho G. Fan Y. Spatiotemporal origin of soil water taken up by vegetation.Nature. 2021; 598: 624-628https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-03958-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar,3Li T. Chen Y.Z.

Such an impact is more pronounced in more arid areas, as indicated by the much higher correlation coefficient between forest cover and soil moisture over arid areas (up to 0.83 for sites with annual precipitation <400–500 mm) compared to humid areas (0.4–0.5 for sites with annual precipitation >500 mm), as shown in the Asian data in Figure 1C. Our findings suggest that by using modern data to interpret past climate-forest interactions, it is possible to understand the paleo forest dynamics, although there are still some limitations. The consideration of soil moisture as a potential factor influencing forest cover has not been fully considered in attempts to understand the deglacial forest conundrum in Asia. Indeed, soil moisture has been overlooked when modeling the interactions between deglacial climate change and forest dynamics. Therefore, we highlighted the significance of soil moisture as a factor affecting the evolution of forest cover in Asia. There is an urgent need for future models and even most climate-forest relationship interpretations to comprehensively incorporate the dynamics of soil water and the resulting impacts, which will advance our understanding of the changes in forest cover. However, the coupling of the soil-plant-atmosphere is complex and might be affected by other environmental factors (e.g., groundwater) than those discussed here.2Miguez-Macho G. Fan Y.

rayyan-224217268,Comparative Evaluation of Water Level Forecasting Using IoT Sensor Data: Hydrodynamic Model SWMM vs. Machine Learning Models Based on NARX Framework,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"This study evaluates the accuracy of water level forecasting using two approaches: the hydrodynamic model SWMM and machine learning (ML) models based on the Nonlinear Autoregressive with Exogenous Inputs (NARX) framework. SWMM offers a physically based modeling approach, while NARX is a data-driven method. Both models use real-time precipitation data, with their predictions compared against measurements from a network of IoT sensors in a stormwater management system. The results demonstrate that while both models provide effective forecasts, NARX models exhibit higher accuracy, with improved Nash–Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) coefficients and 33–37% lower mean absolute error (MAE) compared to SWMM. Despite these advantages, NARX models may struggle with limited data on extreme flooding events, where they could face accuracy challenges. Enhancements in SWMM modeling and calibration could reduce the performance gap, but the development of SWMM models requires substantial expertise and resources. In contrast, NARX models are generally more resource-efficient. Future research should focus on integrating both approaches by leveraging SWMM simulations to generate synthetic data, particularly for extreme weather events, to enhance the robustness of NARX and other ML models in real-world flood prediction scenarios.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/w16192776,"",,
rayyan-224217298,Seasonal precipitation forecasting with large scale climate predictors: a hybrid ensemble empirical mode decomposition-NARX scheme,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract. Much of northern Tunisia regularly experiences extremes of drought and flooding, with high rainfall variability. The development of reliable and accurate seasonal rainfall forecasts can provide valuable information to help mitigate some of the outcome of floods and enhance water management and monitoring, particularly for agriculture. Whether climate indices oscillations contain some information to be useful for hydrological forecasting is worth investigating. Ensemble monthly rainfall forecasts are carried out using a hybrid neural network model. The hybrid model called EEMD-NARX based on a non-linear autoregressive network with exogenous inputs (NARX) coupled to Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD) method is developed in this work. First, the EEMD is performed to extract significant information from modes of variability (IMF) associated to climate indices and precipitation. Each IMF of selected indices as well as precipitation IMFs are then used as inputs to the NARX forecasting model to forecast each IMF of precipitation. To make forecasts operational, we reconstruct precipitation by summing of all forecasted IMFs to make comparison with observed precipitation in the Medjerda river basin located in north Tunisia. Results show that IMFs of MEI and SOI indices can be distinguished from a white noise at the 95 % level. It is also found that an oscillatory forcing coming from the Atlantic influences the precipitation in the Mediterranean basin. The results indicate that exogenous inputs like climatic indices improve the accuracy of forecasts in some in some precipitation stations. The correlation coefficient between observed and forecasted monthly precipitation is ranging from 0.7 to 0.8. EEMD allows extracting significant components from exogenous inputs like climate indices that help reducing predictive uncertainty as well as improving forecasts of a NARX model at longer lead-times.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/piahs-385-267-2024,"",,

The depletion of numerous global aquifers, however, raises concerns regarding the sustainability of groundwater withdrawals and environmental flows. Despite efforts to mitigate this decline, there remains a striking gap in proving the effectiveness of these measures. Our research focuses on the karstic Edwards Aquifer system in Texas to assess how effectively current mitigation strategies are protecting groundwater levels and spring flows, which are essential for biodiversity and water security. Using counterfactual artificial intelligence, we address the critical question: 'What would have happened and may happen in the absence of the mitigation measures?'. This approach offers deep insights into both historical impacts and future projections under intermediate- and high-emission climate scenarios. By simulating what might have happened and could happen in the future without these mitigation measures, our approach provides a robust analysis of the real-world benefits of groundwater management strategies, highlighting their role in enhancing climate resilience and ensuring the sustainability of aquifers. Mitigation policy is critical for counteracting aquifer depletion, but measuring its success can be difficult. A counterfactual approach employing artificial intelligence can provide novel insights into the efficacy of mitigation policies.","",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41893-024-01477-6,"",,

Multi-sensor satellite remote sensing provides an opportunity to map and analyze drawdown frequency and metrics (timing, magnitude, duration) at broad scales. This study developed a cloud computing framework to process time series of synthetic aperture radar (Sentinel 1-SAR) and optical sensor (Landsat 8, Sentinel 2) data to characterize WD in 166 lakes across Massachusetts, USA, during 2016–2021. Comparisons with in situ logger data showed that the Sentinel 1-derived surface water area captured relative water-level fluctuations indicative of WD. A machine learning approach classified lakes as WD versus non-WD based on seasonal water-level fluctuations derived from Sentinel 1-SAR data. The framework mapped WD lakes statewide, revealing prevalence throughout Massachusetts with interannual variability. Results showed WDs occurred in over 75% of lakes during the study period, with high interannual variability in the number of lakes conducting WD. Mean WD magnitude was highest in the wettest year (2018) but % lake area exposure did not show any association with precipitation and varied between 8% to 12% over the 5-year period. WD start date was later and duration was longer in wet years, indicating climate mediation of WD implementation driven by management decisions. The data and tools developed provide an objective information resource to evaluate ecological impacts and guide management of this prevalent but understudied phenomenon. Overall, the results and interactive web tool developed as part of this study provide new hydrologic intelligence to inform water management and policies related to WD practices.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/rs16060947,"",,

In the light of climate change and biodiversity loss, modeling and mapping soil moisture at high spatiotemporal resolution is increasingly crucial for a wide range of applications in Earth and environmental sciences, particularly in areas like boreal forests where comprehensive soil moisture datasets are scarce. Soil moisture, though a small fraction of Earth’s water, plays a fundamental role in terrestrial ecosystem dynamics, influencing meteorological processes, plant health, soil biogeochemistry, groundwater fluctuations, and nutrient exchanges at the land-atmosphere interface. However, understanding and modeling soil moisture dynamics is extremely complex due to the non-linear interplay of numerous physical and biological processes, the large number of drivers involved, and the wide range of spatial and temporal scales at play. Here, we focused on a boreal forest landscape in northern Sweden, where we monitored surface soil moisture with dataloggers at 82 locations during the 2022 vegetation period. We described spatial patterns and temporal fluctuations of soil moisture, we explored the relationships between the observed variations in soil moisture and a vast array of environmental and meteorological factors from multiple sources at varying spatial resolutions and temporal scales, and we tested how these relationships changed over time. Soil properties, topographical features, vegetation characteristics, and land use/land cover were all important contributors of spatial variations in soil moisture, suggesting that current soil moisture maps primarily relying on terrain indices could benefit from integrating this diverse range of information. Moreover, different spatial resolutions and user-defined thresholds of these indices largely affected the performance of the predictions, indicating that topographic proxies for soil moisture should be evaluated for the specific area of interest. Hydrological and meteorological conditions over five to seven days preceding soil moisture measurements were essential in explaining daily soil moisture fluctuations, and influenced the predominant mechanisms governing the spatial distribution of soil moisture. Our findings contribute to advancing physically based land surface and hydrological models, developing machine learning models for predicting spatiotemporal variability in soil moisture, and ultimately generating digital dynamic soil moisture maps for forest management and nature conservation.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-2909,"",,

This study presents a data-driven reconstruction of daily runoff that covers the entirety of Switzerland over an extensive period from 1962 to 2023. To this end, we harness the capabilities of deep learning-based models to learn complex runoff-generating processes directly from observations, thereby facilitating efficient large-scale simulation of runoff rates at ungauged locations. By driving the resulting model with gridded temperature and precipitation data available since the 1960s, we provide a spatiotemporally continuous reconstruction of runoff. The efficacy of the developed model is thoroughly assessed through spatiotemporal cross-validation and compared against a distributed hydrological model, a model used operationally in Switzerland. The developed data-driven model demonstrates not only competitive performance but also notable improvements over traditional hydrological modeling in replicating daily runoff patterns, capturing annual variability, and discerning long-term trends. The resulting long-term reconstruction of runoff is subsequently used to delineate significant shifts in Swiss water resources throughout the past decades. These are characterized by an increased occurrence of dry years, contributing to a negative decadal trend, particularly during the summer months. These insights are pivotal for the understanding and management of water resources, particularly in the context of climate change and environmental conservation. The reconstruction product is made available online. Furthermore, the reduced data dependency and computational efficiency of our model pave the way for simulating diverse scenarios and conducting comprehensive climate attribution studies. This represents a substantial progression in the field, allowing for the analysis of thousands of scenarios in a time frame significantly shorter than traditional methods.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-993,"",,

Timely forecasts of SM spatial distribution and vertical profiles are needed for early detection and prediction of potential droughts. However, previous studies have primarily concentrated on historical or near real‐time soil moisture mapping, with less effort devoted to the development and integration of soil moisture forecast components within drought assessment systems. A satellite‐driven machine‐learning approach was developed in this study to build complex relationships between diversified predictor data sets and in situ multi‐layer SM measurements from the Montana Mesonet, a regionally dense environmental station network in the US upper Missouri and Columbia basins. The resulting 30‐m daily SM predictions showed strong performance against in situ SM measurements from 4‐, 8‐ and 20‐inch soil layers, and with 1‐ to 2‐week forecast lead times ( R &gt; 0.91; RMSE ≤ 0.047 cm 3 /cm 3 ). The machine‐learning model was subsequently applied to the entire Montana region, and the SM deficit forecasts with both 1‐ and 2‐week lead times successfully depicted onset, progression, and termination phases of the 2017 Montana flash drought, which was not effectively identified from prevailing operational systems. The resulting system is capable of delineating local scale SM heterogeneity, and could be extended to predict other critical water cycle variables, potentially enhancing future drought forecasts through multivariate assessments and benefiting water resource management, agricultural practices, and the provision of ecosystem services.","",https://doi.org/10.1029/2023wr036973,"",,

High-performance computing (HPC) and artificial intelligence techniques are crucial in this application. Risk mitigation and coastal management must design scientific workflow appropriately and maintain them continuously updated and operational. Climate change accelerating increase trend of the past decades impacted on sea-level rise, together with broader factors such as geostatic effects and subsidence, reducing the effectiveness of coastal defenses. Due to this, the support tools, such as Early Warning Systems, have become increasingly more valuable because they can process data promptly and provide valuable indications for mitigation proposals. We developed the Shoreline Alert Model (SAM), an operational Python tool that produces simulation scenarios, ‘what-if’ assumptions, and coastal flooding forecasts to fill this gap in our study area. SAM aims to provide decision-makers, scientists, and engineers with new tools to help forecast significant weather-marine events and support related management or emergency responses. SAM aims to fill the gap between the wind-driven wave models, which produce simulations and forecasts of waves of significant height, period, and direction in deep or mid-water, and the run-up local models, which exstimulate marine ingression in the event of intense weather phenomena. It employs a parallelization scheme that allows users to run it on heterogeneous parallel architectures. It produced results approximately 24 times faster than the baseline when using shared memory with distributed memory, processing roughly 20,000 coastal cross-shore profiles along the coastline of the Campania region (Italy).

This study aims to assess and monitor drought using a multi-index approach to provide a comprehensive understanding of its spatio-temporal dynamics at both meteorological and agricultural levels. The research focuses on the Upper Oum Er Rabia watershed, which spans 35,000 km2 and contributes approximately a quarter of Morocco’s renewable water resources. We propose a methodology that combines ERA5 temperature data from remote sensing with ground-based precipitation data to analyze drought characteristics. Three meteorological indices were utilized: the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI), and the Reconnaissance Drought Index (RDI). Additionally, three remote-sensing indices were employed to capture agricultural drought: the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), and the Crop Water Stress Index (CWSI), with a total of 528 NDVI and EVI images and 1016 CWSI images generated through Google Earth Engine (GEE), using machine-learning techniques. Trend analyses were conducted to monitor drought patterns spatio-temporally. Our results reveal that the three-month interval is critical for effective drought monitoring and evaluation. Among the indices, SPEI emerged as the most effective for capturing drought in combination with remote-sensing data, while CWSI exhibited the highest correlation with SPEI over the three-month period, outperforming NDVI and EVI. The trend analysis indicates a significant precipitation deficit, alongside increasing trends in temperature and evapotranspiration over both the short and long term. Furthermore, all drought indices (SPI, SPEI, and RDI) demonstrate an intensification of drought conditions. Adaptation strategies are essential for managing water resources in the Upper Oum Er Rabia watershed under these evolving climate conditions.

In total, over 20.000 permanent high-grade GNSS stations are available worldwide, the positions of which are monitored with millimeter accuracy. Thanks to the high accuracy and the fact that these stations are mounted on the ground, subtle movements due to hydrological changes and crustal deformation can be observed. Thus, the GNSS observations contain valuable geophysical information. Although many geodetic applications require these movements to be properly understood and potentially corrected, this is not trivial due to the complexity of the interactions within the Earth&amp;#8217;s system. Therefore, there is a severe lack of available models explaining residual GNSS station movements beyond conventionally modeled effects. On the opposite, if these movements are properly understood, GNSS observations might contribute to the correct interpretation of emerging environmental changes. This study exploits the wealth of satellite-derived Earth observation (EO) data to derive suitable models to explain GNSS station movements. We combine GNSS station coordinate time series and EO variables with the help of machine learning techniques to benefit from various types of information. While the target vector consists of concatenated GNSS station coordinate time series over Europe, EO variables such as precipitation, soil water, snow water equivalent, and land cover data are used as input features.

This study used SuomiNet Global Positioning System (GPS) data from April 2021 to June 2023 in the United States to comprehensively evaluate 3 and 6 h Global Forecast System (GFS) PWV products (i.e., PWV3h and PWV6h). There was high consistency between the GFS PWV and GPS PWV data, with correlation coefficients (Rs) higher than 0.98 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of about 0.23 cm. The PWV3h product performed slightly better than PWV6h. PWV tended to be underestimated when PWV &gt; 4 cm, and the degree of underestimation increased with increasing water vapor value. The RMSE showed obvious seasonal and diurnal variations, with the RMSE value in summer (i.e., 0.280 cm) considerably higher than in winter (i.e., 0.158 cm), and nighttime were RMSEs higher than daytime RMSEs. Clear-sky conditions showed smaller RMSEs, while cloudy-sky conditions exhibited a smaller range of monthly RMSEs and higher Rs. PWV demonstrated a clear spatial pattern, with both Rs and RMSEs decreasing with increasing elevation and latitude. Based on these temporal and spatial patterns, Back Propagation neural network and random forest (RF) models were employed, using PWV, Julian day, and geographic information (i.e., latitude, longitude, and elevation) as input data to correct the GFS PWV products. The results indicated that the RF model was more advantageous for water vapor correction, improving overall accuracy by 12.08%. In addition, the accuracy of GFS PWV forecasts during hurricane weather was also evaluated. In this extreme weather, the RMSE of the GFS PWV forecast increased comparably to normal weather, but it remained less than 0.4 cm in most cases.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/rs16163043,"",,
rayyan-224217725,"Comprehensive Review of Eutrophication in Freshwater Ecosystems: Causes, Effects, Assessment, and Management Strategies",,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"This review examines eutrophication in freshwater ecosystems, a widespread environmental issue stemming from excessive nutrient input, largely due to human activities. The study explores the origins, consequences, evaluation techniques, and control methods for eutrophication. Primary causes include agricultural discharge, urban development, and climate shifts. The effects are far-reaching, impacting biodiversity, water quality, and socio-economic factors. The assessment utilizes a combination of chemical, physical, and biological markers, with cutting-edge technologies like remote sensing improving monitoring efforts. Mitigation strategies are diverse, incorporating preventative actions (such as nutrient limitation and land management), corrective measures (including bio-manipulation and chemical applications), and regulatory initiatives (like water quality guidelines and nutrient exchange schemes). While case studies demonstrate successful interventions, they also reveal ongoing challenges, particularly ecosystem unpredictability and climate change influences. The research highlights the promise of emerging technologies, notably machine learning, in enhancing management practices. Knowledge gaps persist, especially regarding eutrophication-biodiversity dynamics in tropical environments and the socio-economic ramifications of interventions. The study emphasizes the importance of flexible, comprehensive approaches that blend scientific insights with practical solutions and strong policy structures to tackle this intricate environmental challenge in an era of climate change.","",https://doi.org/10.20944/preprints202409.0704.v1,"",,
rayyan-224217737,Drought dynamics in mixed climate regions: insights for water resource management and climate adaptation strategies,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"<title>Abstract</title> Global warming and climate change are causing temperatures to rise, which is having a negative impact on water resources. Climate change is a worldwide problem that affects and will continue to affect the frequency and intensity of natural disasters in many regions of the world. Tunceli region in Turkey, which until ten years ago was known as an environmentally friendly city with abundant water resources and frequent rainfall, is experiencing a decrease in precipitation during the snowy winter season. This situation has made the investigation of climate change impacts an important issue in the region. Therefore, effective climate change adaptation strategies need to be developed. To determine these strategies, in this study, we assessed drought conditions using drought indices such as Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), Reconnaissance Drought Index (RDI), Normal Precipitation Index (PNI), and Aridity Index (AI). The SPI and RDI analyses were performed in annual reference periods on a time scale of 3, 6, 9, and 12 months using temperature, precipitation, and evaporation data. Consequently, the SPI and RDI results were compared, and both indices show similar behavior in dry, wet, and normal seasons. Nevertheless, RDI shows less variation between different time scales, which is an advantage over SPI and is probably due to the inclusion of potential evapotranspiration in RDI. The variations in PNI between humid and dry sub-humid categorizations throughout the years, combined with the AI results, indicate that the Tunceli region predominantly experiences a climate ranging from dry sub-humid to semi-arid. This study could help decision-makers take effective measures to become more resilient to climate change in temperate climate regions and take important steps toward sustainable water resources management.","",https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-4518030/v1,"",,
rayyan-224217777,Machine Learning-based Hydrological Models for Flash Floods: A Systematic Literature Review,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Background: Flash flood modeling faces many challenges since physically-based hydrological models are unsuitable for a small spatiotemporal scale. With the increased availability of hydrological observed data, an alternative approach is to use Machine Learning (ML) techniques. This work conducts a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) to enhance our comprehension of the research landscape on ML applications for modeling flash floods. Methods: Starting with more than 1,217 papers published until January 2024 and indexed in Web of Science, SCOPUS/Elsevier, Springer/Nature, or Wiley databases, we selected 53 for detailed analysis, following the PRISMA guidelines. The inclusion/exclusion criteria removed reviews, retractions, and papers that were not in the scope of this SLR and included only papers with time resolution coarser than 12 hours. Data about forecasting horizon, area, method and input were extracted from each study to identify which ML techniques and model designs have been applied to flash flood forecasting. Results and Discussion: There has been a notable increase in publications investigating ML techniques for flash flood modeling over the last few years. Most studies focus on regions in China (36%) and the United States (11%). Of the total of selected papers, more than 90% used as input data just one or an exclusive combination of the following measurements: discharge, rainfall, and water level. From this set, the combination of discharge and rainfall appears in almost half of the papers. Notably, almost 60% of the studies utilize the long short-term memory (LSTM) method. No one method always performs better than any other in the selected papers. Unfortunately, less than 10% of selected articles provide access to their data. To further explore the potential of ML approaches in flood forecasting, we recommend their integration into early warning systems, development and dissemination of benchmarks, publication of successful case studies, and multidisciplinary collaboration.","",https://doi.org/10.31223/x5c699,"",,

It covers the baseline period (1995-2014) and future projections (2081-2100). Future meteorological variables were derived from the Canadian Earth System Model version 5 (CanESM5) under two emission scenarios downscaled using a machine-learning approach. The continuous daily inflow of the reservoir over an extended period was simulated by employing the IHACRES rainfall-runoff model, in conjunction with the Water Evaluation and Planning system (WEAP) to replicate water level dynamics and outflow. The evaluation of water quality for the years 2019-2020 was conducted utilizing a calibrated CE-QUAL-W2, and any missing data was approximated through empirical relationships. Our findings indicate that the average surface water temperature and the average PO<sub>4</sub> concentration, which respectively stands at 22.8 °C and 0.27 mg/L in the baseline scenario, are projected to increase under both SSP1-1.9 (24.4 °C and 0.31 mg/L) and SSP5-8.5 (26 °C and 0.48 mg/L) scenarios. Whereas the average DO concentration of 8.2 mg/L in the baseline scenario is expected to decline in the mentioned scenarios (7.3 and 6.01 mg/L, respectively). The increase in the temperature of the water and the subsequent decline in DO and PO<sub>4</sub> levels in deeper waters pose a significant threat to the sustainable growth of aquatic species in the Karun VI reservoir in the future.","",https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-3917984/v1,"",,

To overcome this challenge, we developed an advanced modeling framework based on a recurrent neural network of long short-term memory (LSTM) as an alternative to complex and computationally expensive physical models. GW anomalies were forecast two months in advance (t + 2) based on the evaluation of drivers that influence GW dynamics in densely irrigated agricultural regions.

GW anomaly observations were acquired from 26 piezometers (wells) installed in the sandy aquifer in WCS over 10–60 years.

rayyan-224218060,Coupled intelligent prediction model for medium- to long-term runoff based on teleconnection factors selection and spatial-temporal analysis,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Accurate medium- to long-term runoff forecasting is of great significance for flood control, drought mitigation, comprehensive water resource management, and ecological restoration. However, runoff formation is a complex process influenced by various natural and anthropogenic factors, resulting in nonlinearity, nonstationarity, and long prediction periods, which complicate forecasting efforts. Traditional statistical models, which primarily focus on individual runoff sequences, struggle to integrate multi-source data, limiting their predictive accuracy. This narrow approach overlooks the multifaceted variables influencing runoff, resulting in incomplete and less reliable predictions. To address these challenges, we selected and integrated Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Regression (SVR), and Multilayer Perceptron Regression (MLPR) to develop two coupled intelligent prediction models—RF-SVR and RF-MLPR—due to their complementary strengths. RF effectively removes collinear and redundant information from high-dimensional data, while SVR and MLPR handle nonlinearity and nonstationarity, offering enhanced generalization capabilities. Specifically, MLPR, with its deep learning structure, can extract more complex latent information from data, making it particularly suitable for long-term forecasting. The proposed models were tested in the Yalong River Basin (YLRB), where accurate medium- to long-term runoff forecasts are essential for ecological management, flood control, and optimal water resource allocation. The results demonstrate the following: (1) The impact of atmospheric circulation indices on YLRB runoff exhibits a one-month lag, providing crucial insights for water resource scheduling and flood prevention. (2) The coupled models effectively eliminate collinearity and redundant variables, improving prediction accuracy across all forecast periods. (3) Compared to single baseline models, the coupled models demonstrated significant performance improvements across six evaluation metrics. For instance, the RF-MLPR model achieved a 3.7%–6.5% improvement in the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) metric across four hydrological stations compared to the RF-SVR model. (4) Prediction accuracy decreased with longer forecast periods, with the R 2 value dropping from 0.8886 for a 1-month forecast to 0.6358 for a 12-month forecast, indicating the increasing challenge of long-term predictions due to greater uncertainty and the accumulation of influencing factors over time. (5) The RF-MLPR model outperformed the RF-SVR model, demonstrating a superior ability to capture the complex, nonlinear relationships inherent in the data. For example, in terms of the R 2 metric, the RF-MLPR model’s performance at the Jinping hydrological station improved by 6.5% compared to the RF-SVR model. Similarly, at the Lianghekou station, for a one-month lead prediction period, the RF-MLPR model’s R 2 value was 7.9% higher than that of the RF-SVR model. The significance of this research lies not only in its contribution to improving hydrological prediction accuracy but also in its broader applicability. The proposed coupled prediction models provide practical tools for water resource management, flood control planning, and drought mitigation in regions with similar hydrological characteristics. Furthermore, the framework’s flexibility in parameterization and its ability to integrate multi-source data offer valuable insights for interdisciplinary applications across environmental sciences, meteorology, and climate prediction, making it a globally relevant contribution to addressing water management challenges under changing climatic conditions.","",https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0313871,"",,
rayyan-224218106,Groundwater level projections for aquifers affected by annual to decadal hydroclimate variations,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"In a context where anticipating future trends and long-term variations in water resources is crucial, improving our knowledge about most types of aquifer responses to climate variability and change is necessary. Aquifers with variability dominated by seasonal (marked annual cycle) or low-frequency variations (interannual to decadal variations driven by large-scale climate dynamics) may encounter different sensitivities to climate change. We investigated this hypothesis by generating groundwater level projections using deep learning models for annual, inertial (low-frequency dominated) or mixed annual/low-frequency aquifer types in northern France from 16 CMIP6 climate model inputs in an ensemble approach. Generated projections were then analysed for trends and changes in variability. Generally, groundwater levels tended to decrease for all types and scenarios across the 2030-2100. The variability of projections showed slightly increasing variability for annual types for all scenarios but decreasing variability for mixed and inertial types. As the severity of the scenario increased, more mixed and inertial-type stations appeared to be affected by decreasing variability. Focusing on low-frequency confirmed this observation: while a significant amount of stations showed increasing variability for the less severe SSP 2-4.5 scenario, low-frequency variability eventually showed slight yet statistically significant decreasing trends as the severity of the scenario increased. For the most severe scenario, almost all stations were affected by decreasing low-frequency variability. Finally, groundwater levels seemed, in most instances, slightly higher in the future than in the historical period, without any significant differences between emission scenarios.","",https://doi.org/10.22541/essoar.172526712.23981307/v1,"",,

These materials are ubiquitous in natural systems, for instance, in animal and plant tissues, brown algae, and bacterial biofilms. Hydrogels possess inherent structural and multifunctional properties that have long inspired material scientists and technologists. As a result, they have been adapted, improved, and innovated upon to meet diverse needs across various fields, ranging from medicine to environmental science.The aim of this Collection of publications in ACS Materials Letters is to showcase the diverse applications of hydrogels recently published in the journal and to inspire interdisciplinary collaboration among scientists. The papers in this Collection illustrate the virtue of integrating hydrogels with other materials and concepts from chemistry and materials science, thus expanding their functionality, potential, and versatility. This Editorial will highlight the diverse innovations featured in this Collection and offer insights into the future of hydrogel research.Advances in Hydrogel EngineeringClick to copy section linkSection link copied!Hydrogels are remarkably versatile materials, which can be designed with a wide range of properties. However, they have inherent limitations that can restrict their use in certain applications. For example, mechanical weakness, lack of conductivity, and sensitivity to dehydration. These intrinsic limitations of hydrogels have driven researchers to explore creative strategies for enhancing their properties. Among these strategies are the incorporation of nanoparticles, the use of molecular engineering and self-assembly approaches, polymer chemistry and engineering, and the application of advanced fabrication techniques.The rational use of these strategies has not only addressed some of the natural drawbacks of hydrogels, but also endowed them with properties not inherently associated with them. These include self-healing capabilities, conductivity, and responsiveness to different stimuli, making hydrogels suitable for a wide range of innovative applications, including in agriculture, environmental sustainability, flexible electronics, biosensing, and medicine. In the following sections, some of the key applications of hydrogels are explored, as highlighted in the articles from this Collection.Agricultural and Environmental ApplicationsClick to copy section linkSection link copied!Hydrogels are emerging as valuable materials in addressing the global challenges of water scarcity and sustainable resource management. Their ability to absorb, store, and release water in a controlled manner makes them particularly well-suited for applications where access to clean water is limited. In their recent Letter, Yu et al. (DOI: 10.1021/acsmaterialslett.4c01120) explore hydrogels as a tool to improve water retention in soils, enabling more efficient water use in crop production, especially in arid regions.Beyond agriculture, hydrogels are also proving useful in environmental applications aimed at securing water resources. For instance, hydrogels have been incorporated into systems for seawater desalination, as demonstrated by Bai, Cai, and co-workers (DOI: 10.1021/acsmaterialslett.3c00761), and atmospheric water harvesting as reported by Wu, Wang et al. (DOI: 10.1021/acsmaterialslett.1c00723). In these applications, composite hydrogels enhance water collection by improving sunlight absorption for evaporation or by leveraging ionic interactions that boost water vapor absorption from the air. These examples highlight the potential of hydrogels to contribute to more sustainable water management practices in both agricultural and environmental contexts.Additionally, a recent contribution from Lee et al. (DOI: 10.1021/acsmaterialslett.3c01648) demonstrated hydrogels in the development of environmentally friendly materials such as self-healing, thermally responsive DNA-based bioplastics. These bioplastics, designed to degrade on demand, offer a novel solution to reducing plastic waste.As access to clean water and the need for sustainable materials become increasingly urgent, the use of hydrogels for environmental applications is expected to grow, providing practical solutions to some of the most pressing environmental challenges worldwide.Flexible Electronics and Biosensing ApplicationsClick to copy section linkSection link copied!Wearable electronics are becoming an integral part of our everyday lives, as we increasingly recognize the convenience of continuous monitoring and real-time access to information. With advancements in hydrogel synthesis strategies, such as those discussed by Liu, Liu et al. (DOI: 10.1021/acsmaterialslett.3c00320), and their expanding capabilities, we can now envision multifunctional, flexible wearable and bioelectronic devices that seamlessly integrate with natural systems. Hsu, Uyama et al. (DOI: 10.1021/acsmaterialslett.4c00809) provide a clear example of how the rational integration of nanotechnology tools, polymer science and advanced fabrication methods, can produce hydrogels with unique properties including skin-like softness, conformability, antidrying, and responsiveness to environmental stimuli. This makes these engineered hydrogels particularly suited for flexible electronic and biosensing applications, offering new possibilities for more comfortable and functional devices.Innovative fabrication techniques, like 3D printing, are playing a pivotal role in advancing hydrogel-based technologies. For example, Chen et al. (DOI: 10.1021/acsmaterialslett.3c00439) developed 3D-printed hydrogels with self-healing and ion-conductive capabilities, enabling the creation of custom-designed wearable sensors and soft robotics which can adapt to complex movements and varying conditions.Additionally, the development of nanocomposite hydrogels with biomimetic architectures, such as those created by Wu, Liu, Zeng et al. (DOI: 10.1021/acsmaterialslett.2c00778), hold great promise for opening new avenues in high-performance electromagnetic interference shielding. These materials could not only protect sensitive electronic devices and systems from disruptive electromagnetic waves, but also potentially reduce user exposure to them.On the biosensing front, hydrogels are becoming platforms for advanced sensing systems. For example, Hoogenboom, Woisel et al. (DOI: 10.1021/acsmaterialslett.2c00817) cleverly utilized supramolecular chemistries to create hydrogels with dual memory functions, allowing them to record not only temperature changes, but also the duration of exposure to those temperatures. Moreover, self-assembly, a key principle in molecular engineering, has emerged as a powerful strategy for designing hydrogel-based sensors. For instance, the sequential activation of DNA oligonucleotides precisely patterned within hydrogels, or the self-assembly of DNA molecules into mechanically stable hydrogels triggered by specific miRNA sequences, enables sophisticated sensing mechanisms and the development of smart materials with potential applications in bioelectronics and diagnostics as demonstrated by Schulman et al. (DOI: 10.1021/acsmaterialslett.2c00286) and Miao et al. (DOI: 10.1021/acsmaterialslett.4c00650).As hydrogel technologies evolve, they hold great potential for advancing the field of flexible electronics and biosensing, driving the creation of more functional devices that seamlessly integrate into everyday life.Biomedical ApplicationsClick to copy section linkSection link copied!Biomedical applications continue to be one of the most extensively studied areas for hydrogels. Their remarkable versatility offers a wide range of solutions in medicine, from drug delivery and wound healing to engineered tissues for modeling and therapy.Thanks to their porous structure and high water-absorption capacity, hydrogels naturally serve as excellent reservoirs for storing and releasing therapeutic agents. Recent advancements in smart materials have enabled more precise control over the release of these molecules, improving their performance in specific applications. For instance, Choi et al. (DOI: 10.1021/acsmaterialslett.3c00886) incorporated light- and heat-responsive nanoparticles that allow hydrogels to release therapeutic proteins at specific times and locations, even inside cells. Moreover, through rational synthesis and fabrication processes, molecules can be programmed to release in response to specific stimuli. This has been particularly impactful in tissue regeneration applications, such as treating spinal cord injuries, as demonstrated by Chen, Liu, Shi et al. (DOI: 10.1021/acsmaterialslett.3c01339), or diabetic wounds, as shown by Guo et al. (DOI: 10.1021/acsmaterialslett.3c00925), where hydrogels first regulate the inflammatory environment and then promote tissue regeneration. These innovations have also made a significant impact on cancer therapy. In their review article, Loh, Ye, Li et al. (DOI: 10.1021/acsmaterialslett.1c00558), make this clear by summarizing how hydrogel patches, often combined with nanoparticles, have become a popular strategy for targeted drug delivery, reducing systemic toxicity and enhancing the efficacy of anticancer treatments.While the high water content of hydrogels is advantageous in many biomedical applications, it also presents challenges, particularly in areas such as wound healing, where their mechanical properties and adhesion can be compromised. This Collection showcases several strategies to address these drawbacks. For example, by adding graphene oxide to protein-based hydrogels, Martín, Jorcano et al. (DOI: 10.1021/acsmaterialslett.2c01044) were able to tune the gelation kinetics and porosity, resulting in hydrogels with enhanced mechanical properties. Despite these advancements, Annabi, Khademhosseini, Weiss, and collaborators (DOI: 10.1021/acsmaterialslett.3c00193) reveal that some challenges remain. Their research on catechol-functionalized hydrogels for bioadhesion demonstrates their potential but also highlights the limitations of photopolymerizable and click-chemistry-based hydrogels, pointing to areas where further development is needed.Beyond their therapeutic applications, hydrogels are increasingly being used as models to simulate complex biological phenomena. With proper engineering, they can closely replicate the architecture and function of natural tissues. For example, two-photon 3D printing has been employed to create hydrogels with tunable confinement properties, specifically designed to study cancer cell migration. By precisely controlling the stiffness and geometry of the hydrogel microenvironment, Dong, Urciuolo, Fan, Elvassore et al. (DOI: 10.1021/acsmaterialslett.3c00853) simulate the physical confinement experienced by cells in vivo, providing valuable insights into cancer metastasis and the mechanical interactions between cells and their surroundings.Advancements in material engineering are also enabling the creation of hydrogels that more closely resemble natural tissues. For instance, the development of shape-memory hydrogels responsive to body temperature, such as those engineered by Costa, Mano et al. (DOI: 10.1021/acsmaterialslett.2c00107), opens up new possibilities for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.These technological platforms, where hydrogels are capable of sensing, activating, and performing autonomous functions, are expected to extend into areas such as organ and tissue creation, among other biomedical applications.Challenges and Future PerspectivesClick to copy section linkSection link copied!Despite the impressive progress in hydrogel engineering, several challenges remain. Integrating hydrogels with other materials often requires complex fabrication processes, and ensuring long-term stability in different environments can be difficult. Additionally, scaling up these advanced hydrogels for commercial use is still a major challenge. By overcoming these challenges, hydrogels could play an even bigger role in a wide range of applications, from sustainable agriculture, water scarcity, organ shortage, advanced medical devices, and even food security.One significant challenge in hydrogel research is the costly and complex characterization of these materials. However, AI-driven tools like SEMPro, introduced by Bae et al. (DOI: 10.1021/acsmaterialslett.3c00909), are beginning to simplify this process, offering fast and accurate insights from scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images to understand the link between a hydrogel's microstructure and its properties. This not only streamlines material characterization but also accelerates the development of more advanced, cost-effective hydrogels. As AI continues to evolve, it will likely become essential in creating materials that meet the increasingly complex demands of modern applications, pushing innovation forward more efficiently.Looking ahead, hydrogels will likely become more present in our everyday lives, integrated seamlessly due to their natural resemblance to biological tissues. This organic integration, combined with continuous advancements in their design and functionality, promises a future where hydrogels are not just specialty materials, but key components in a wide array of consumer products and industrial applications.Author InformationClick to copy section linkSection link copied!Corresponding AuthorGrissel Trujillo de Santiago, Centro de Biotecnología-FEMSA, Tecnologico de Monterrey, Monterrey, Nuevo León 64849 México; Departamento de Ingeniería Mecatrónica y Eléctrica, Escuela de Ingeniería y Ciencias, Tecnologico de Monterrey, Monterrey, Nuevo León 64849 México, https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9230-4607, Email: [email protected]NotesViews expressed in this editorial are those of the author and not necessarily the views of the ACS.Cited By Click to copy section linkSection link copied!This article has not yet been cited by other publications.Download PDFFiguresReferencesOpen PDF Get e-AlertsGet e-AlertsACS Materials LettersCite this: ACS Materials Lett. 2024, 6, XXX, 4908–4910Click to copy citationCitation copied!https://doi.org/10.1021/acsmaterialslett.4c01903Published October 8, 2024 Publication History Received 16 September 2024Accepted 16 September 2024Published online 8 October 2024© 2024 American Chemical Society.

rayyan-224218245,"The 2024 “Hacking Limnology” Workshop Series and Virtual Summit: Increasing Inclusion, Participation, and Representation in the Aquatic Sciences",,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"The 4th Aquatic Ecosystem MOdeling Network—Junior (AEMON-J) Hacking Limnology Workshop and 5th Virtual Summit: Incorporating Data Science and Open Science in the Aquatic Sciences (DSOS) convened 15–19 July 2024. During the week, these joint communities engaged in activities at the intersection of big data, open science, modeling, remote sensing, and the aquatic sciences. The weeklong event, with over 100 aquatic science practitioners and enthusiasts, followed a similar structure to previous years, comprising three days of workshops followed by two days of the virtual summit (Meyer and Zwart 2020; Meyer et al. 2021b, 2022, 2023). As in previous years, accessibility for a global audience was a top priority. Both events had no registration fees, thereby enabling broad participation. All recordings and workshop materials were made freely available on the Open Science Framework (OSF) archive (Meyer et al. 2021a) (https://osf.io/682v5/) for asynchronous viewing and access following the event. Relative to the 60 countries represented annually in the 2021, 2022, and 2023 workshops and summits (Meyer et al. 2021b, 2022, 2023), the 2024 workshop and summit experienced an expansion in global representation, with the majority of registrants from newly represented countries such as Nepal and Colombia. All registrants together represented more than 70 countries. With over 600 registrants worldwide, the most represented countries included the United States (30.5% of registrants), Nigeria (10.9%), Canada (9.1%), Germany (5.8%), and Nepal (4.5%). Notably, the 2024 Workshops and Summit had the lowest proportional representation from the United States in comparison to the previous summits (Fig. 1) and was the first year with two countries in Asia being in the top 10 based on the number of registrants (Nepal and India; Table 1). With respect to career-stage, most participants identified as being in early-career positions (i.e., graduate students and post-doctoral researchers; ~50%), as in previous years (Meyer et al. 2023). This year's ""Hacking Limnology"" Workshop series featured three consecutive days of workshops. For each day, the workshop included a short, prerecorded introduction that attendees could watch prior to attending, a 45-minute keynote talk followed by a live question-and-answer session, two hours for the hands-on workshop portion, and finally one hour of breakout and working groups to discuss next steps and potential collaborations. All three workshops allowed for hands-on coding; the first and third workshops were in R (R Core Team 2024), and the second was in Python (Python Software Foundation 2024). The workshops were recorded so they could be watched asynchronously by the large number of international attendees living in different time zones. Following the workshops, all introductory materials, keynote talks, scripts, and workshop recordings were made publicly available on the OSF archive (Meyer et al. 2021a) (https://osf.io/682v5/). The focus of the first workshop was the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project (ISIMIP). ISIMIP is an international modeling initiative that quantifies climate change impacts using earth system models across different sectors and spatial scales, that is, lakes, under different climate change scenarios (Golub et al. 2022). The second workshop centered around remote sensing data from the Surface Water Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite (Biancamaria et al. 2016). The third workshop focused on Ordinary Differential Equation-based ecological modeling using the ""rodeo"" R package (Kneis et al. 2017). Each day of the workshop was well attended (up to 110 people), and engagement remained high throughout each day. Several people participated in the postworkshop breakout and working group meetings as well. Because DSOS operated independently for one year prior to joining forces with AEMON-J, the 2024 Virtual Summit marks the fifth year of DSOS Virtual Summits. As in previous years, the summit consisted of a wide range of presenters, including sessions related to big data, data-intensive models, climate change, and applications of open science. Each session consisted of three to four presenters, where each presenter prepared a 10-minute, prerecorded video of their presentation, which was streamed live during the summit. Presentations spanned a range of topics, including building crowdsourced zooplankton datasets, forecasting ecosystem function over a range of climate scenarios, creating accessible data visualizations for wide audiences, and organizing grassroots communities for expanding open science. As with previous summits, all question-and-answer sessions were live following the streaming of all presentations, where questions were submitted in a written format and presenters could access the questions in real time for better preparation. Questions and answers revolved around a suite of themes, including how to avoid ""parachute science"" (Barber et al. 2014), how to develop grassroots data harmonization efforts, and how to best work with complex spatiotemporal datasets for modeling purposes. In addition to recorded scientific presentations, the summit also hosted a career panel. This year's panel focused on career paths in industry settings, with panelists from corporations, consulting companies, and start-ups. Panelists included Kate Fickas (Esri), Arik Tashie (ClimateAI), Kateri Salk (TetraTech), Leslie Smith (Your Ocean Consulting, LLC), and Tung Nguyen (Jacobs Solutions, Inc). In their discussion, many of the panelists focused on translating science products into a portfolio that could be shared and presented to a range of industry settings. Moreover, panelists emphasized the pervasiveness of imposter syndrome, the need to recognize differences in ""experience thresholds"" across job sectors, and the importance of marketing your skills to hiring managers. As with years prior, the 2024 ""Hacking Limnology"" Workshops and Virtual Summit attracted wide attention from researchers across various career stages, experiences, and locations. Though the format was comparable to previous events, the content has expanded to more inclusively represent the researchers and themes in the nexus of data science, open science, and the aquatic sciences. The ever-popular remote sensing content has expanded from optical to radar and altimetry remote sensing. Big data conversations have expanded from -omics and high-frequency monitoring to include community composition and function databases. Numerical modeling efforts upscaled from local site studies to global climate change assessments. Discussions of career trajectories in data science and open science have arced across a spectrum from academia to government to industry settings. In short, the past 4 years of workshops and 5 year of summits have remained as dynamic as the science that they communicate, and the representation of presenters, panelists, and organizational team members has likewise expanded to showcase and connect the diversity of people engaging in this science (Tables 2 and 3). The fourth joint ""Hacking Limnology"" Workshop Series and DSOS Virtual Summit also provided an opportunity to look back on the successes and challenges of the prior half decade of summits. Meyer and Zwart (2020) highlighted how the inaugural Virtual Summit created an opportunity for a wide community to participate and network in the data-intensive aquatic sciences but had definite needs for improvement in speaker representation. Although an ever-increasing ease in conducting science virtually has enabled for the summits to run more smoothly, the most noticeable improvement for the summits has been the representation of speakers and those involved in the community. Although the first summit strove for diverse representation, the finalized speaker list fell short of those goals. Meyer and Zwart (2020) suggested that more diverse speaker representation could be achieved through inviting speakers further in advance of the summit, creating opportunities for panels, and intentionally focusing on soliciting speakers from a range of backgrounds. Since 2020, the workshops and summits have grown to include speakers and organizers of numerous backgrounds, identities, and experiences (Tables 2 and 3). Likely as a result of our intentional focus on increasing representation, the reach of AEMON-J and DSOS beyond a primarily North American audience has also grown. Although earlier summits had higher synchronous participation (~120–160 people), the previous 3 years have maintained high registration (457–684 people) and synchronous attendance (40–140 people). While opportunity abounds to improve on these foundations, the organizing team is enthusiastic about the overwhelming positive responses the workshops and summits have received. With the growth of data-intensive aquatic science, the organizational team is confident that we have identified a needed space where modelers from numerical, machine learning, and statistical backgrounds can converge, discuss, and share experiences centered on data science and open science topics (Meyer and Zwart 2020). The scale, scope, pace, and dynamism of this workshop and virtual summit are reflections of the interest in this nexus, and we look forward to seeing how it grows in the future.

rayyan-224218246,The Royal Meteorological Society's Quarterly Journal: celebrating 150 years,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"The Royal Meteorological Society's (RMetS) flagship publication, the Quarterly Journal of the Royal Meteorological Society (QJ), celebrated its 150th anniversary in 2023. This milestone has been celebrated in several ways. A fully open-access special collection1 of 22 classic papers published in QJ highlights key advances in the subject, stretching from 1925 to 2020; these were selected by a group of current and former editors. The special collection is accompanied by a highly informative introduction by QJ's current Chief Editors (Ross and Methven, 2023). In addition, a digital timeline2 highlights these papers, plus many more suggested by the RMetS History Special Interest Group, and places QJ in the context of the Society's wider history. On 13 September 2023, a commemorative meeting 'RMetS Quarterly Journal: Celebrating 150 Years' was held at Imperial College3. John Methven (University of Reading) and Andrew Ross (University of Leeds) presented a precis of the Ross and Methven (2023) article and provided statistics of both the geographical distribution of articles and downloads, buttressing the evidence of QJ's continuing wide international reach and impact. Tim Woollings (University of Oxford) highlighted the key role of QJ in the development of understanding of Rossby (or planetary) waves, from their initial identification to their heavy influence in understanding the large-scale dynamics of the mid-latitude atmosphere. A paper by Carl-Gustaf Rossby himself in QJ in 1940 introduced the precursor to what is now known as potential vorticity, a key concept in mid-latitude atmospheric dynamics. Earlier work focused on the stationarity of Rossby waves before attention moved on to their propagation, and the importance of this in maintaining the mid-latitude jet stream. Later work in QJ recognised that westerly flows are baroclinically unstable; this played an important role in understanding the development of mid-latitude weather systems, and their impact on the large-scale heat and momentum budgets. Anthony McNally (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF)) spoke on 'Data assimilation: a fusion of knowledge and the rise of the machines'. This led us through the foundational role of data assimilation in providing the initial conditions for numerical weather prediction (NWP), through its equally foundational role in the development of climate reanalyses (such as ECMWF's ERA5 reanalysis) in modern-day climate science, to its use in improving numerical models. The scale of the problem (fusing data from multiple different sources and the quest for ever higher resolution) was emphasised. Looking to the future, the recent 'astonishing' rate of advances in machine learning not only challenges conventional approaches to data assimilation and NWP, but also challenges conventional paths to how such work is presented in learned journals such as QJ. Brian Golding (Met Office) focused on the quest for accurate NWP rainfall forecasts. He took us on a journey from the pioneering work of Bjerknes and Richardson in the early twentieth century, through successive advances in the Met Office forecasting system (including the 10-level model in the 1960s, the 15km resolution mesoscale model in the 1990s, to the current kilometre-scale (and 70 level) ensemble forecasts). The impressive capabilities of the current data assimilation and forecasting system were demonstrated. The talk finished with a discussion of 'metrics of success' of forecasts, not only in terms of the meteorological predictions, but also in their role in early-warning systems that value lives saved, losses avoided and essential services maintained. Alan Blyth and Steven Böing (both University of Leeds and the National Centre for Atmospheric Science) moved us to smaller scales, discussing the influence of entrainment (i.e. the mixing of in-cloud air with air in the surrounding environment) on the evolution of clouds, and of raindrops in cumulus clouds. Early work had identified the problem of understanding droplet size distribution in the early stages of cloud development and the question of why measured times for producing raindrops were shorter than predicted. Understanding of the role of inhomogeneous mixing, whereby some droplets grew much more quickly than others, developed via a mixture of observations and modelling. The current status of the field, via increasingly sophisticated numerical modelling approaches of how parcels of air mix, was demonstrated and applied to reproducing observations of cloud evolution from detailed case studies. The talks were broken up by a panel discussion on publishing in meteorology, featuring Andrew Ross (University of Leeds), Alison Brown (RMetS) and Anna Ghelli (RMetS) as panellists and chaired by Fran Morris (University of Oxford). Paul Trevorrow (Wiley) was unable to attend due to illness, but nonetheless contributed some fascinating insights about the nature of publishing in its present form from a publisher's perspective. The panel began with a discussion of what has made QJ so successful over the past 150 years, with Co-Chief Editor Andrew Ross highlighting its widespread appeal to not only national but international authors and audiences. The subsequent conversation flowed through a selection of pertinent topics in the current publishing landscape; for example, the challenges and advantages of open access, the nature of article promotion, improving diversity in publishing and the current state of peer review, with a look forward to how publishing is likely to change in the future. Questions from the audience continued to explore these topics, as well as bringing up further discussion points such as the advantages of working with a major publisher. Returning to the series of talks, Joanna Haigh (Imperial College, London) discussed QJ's role in the development of understanding of climate science. Even in 1901 (in a paper by Nils Gustaf Ekholm) it was postulated that 'the present burning of pit coal … if this continues … will undoubtedly cause a very obvious rise' in surface temperature. The key work in QJ of Guy Stewart Callendar in 1938 stands out as the first to actively attribute observed warming to increasing CO2 levels. QJ was also home to Gordon Manley's early papers on the Central England Temperature record back to 1659, one of the world's longest temperature records. Many papers in QJ have advanced the understanding of the propagation of solar and infrared radiation through the atmosphere which provides essential underpinning of global model predictions of climate change; as pointed out by many of the day's speakers, descriptions of the development of such global models have always been a key feature of QJ. In the day's shortest title ('The Stratosphere'), Mark Baldwin (University of Exeter) took us through from the discovery of the stratosphere in the early twentieth century to today. Alan Brewer's 1949 paper on the circulation of the stratosphere is perhaps the favourite QJ paper of the first author of this Meeting Report; from a few observations of water vapour in the mid-latitude lower stratosphere, Brewer deduced what became known as the Brewer–Dobson circulation; air enters the stratosphere in the tropics and descends in the extratropics. Full explanation of this circulation would follow decades later. Other stratospheric phenomena had a significant gap between discovery and explanation, including the quasi-biennial oscillation (of wind direction in the tropical stratosphere), sudden stratospheric warmings (high-latitude warmings of tens of kelvin within a few days) and the Antarctic Ozone Hole. More recently, there has been growth in understanding of how these phenomena impact surface weather and climate, adding an important dimension to accurate weather forecasting. Via a focus on three QJ papers, Bablu Sinha (National Oceanography Centre, Southampton), in his talk 'The Sea, The Sea – a fine tradition of oceanographic research', emphasised the strong connections between meteorology and physical oceanography. This included the links between papers ostensibly about the atmosphere that would heavily influence physical oceanography. Examples are the relationship between mesoscale eddies and the larger-scale ocean circulation, the role of Rossby waves in understanding Atlantic Multidecadal Variability (a key mode of climate variability) and what may seem surprising to some, the debate about the importance of the Gulf Stream in maintaining western Europe's mild winter climate. In future, enhanced observational monitoring and higher resolution ocean modelling will enable focus on key issues, such as the stability of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation. Thorwald Stein (University of Reading) celebrated the role of remote sensing observations in understanding atmospheric phenomena on all scales and for providing vital inputs to the data assimilation process. A cluster of papers in QJ in 1950 presaged the key role of radar both in monitoring rainfall and in understanding key physical processes in the formation of that precipitation. The advent of satellite imagery in the early 1960s gave an unprecedented view of weather systems, leading to, for example, the identification of cloud patterns that presaged damaging winds in mid-latitude depressions. Via ingenious instrumentation, satellite observations also allowed a much more complete global picture of stratospheric temperatures, including the first observations of the development of sudden stratospheric warmings in the Antarctic. The future promises more novel instrumentation (e.g. direct observations of biochemical processes involved in photosynthesis) and low-cost satellite systems, led by commercial organisations. Past president Lesley Gray (University of Oxford) led the meeting's Organising Committee, ably assisted by the RMetS staff. It might be tempting to suggest that the motivation for an early-career researcher (ECR) attending a non-obligatory event celebrating a journal is linked to the food on offer. In fact, it would not be an incorrect statement. However, on behalf of the group of ECRs attending the 150th Anniversary Celebration, I can safely say that it was not only the delicious (and vegan) cake that made the day a hugely worthwhile experience. For early-career scientists in the 2020s, it is a refreshing experience to take a day away from the specifics of a postgraduate or postdoctoral research programme and develop our wider understanding of the field of meteorology. The historical perspective of the talks over the course of the day, as well as seeing physical copies of the historic QJ editions mentioned in the talks, enabled us to get a rich overview of the background of our field. Seeing the first satellite images ever taken, discovering one of the first proposals of anthropogenic climate change and watching the history of ECMWF model skill evolve over time were particularly inspirational experiences. However, the event was also an opportunity for us to be present in the current meteorology community, with plenty of chances for networking with the other ECRs in attendance, as well as experienced professors and meteorologists with years of knowledge. Reconnecting with colleagues and friends at other institutions is always a welcome break, especially for cohorts of scientists who have spent large proportions of their career, so far, attending virtual events where there were fewer chances to get to know others. Several ECRs presented posters over the lunch and coffee breaks, showcasing their exciting new research. As an ECR, we are often told that later in our careers we will lean on the connections that are made in our first years of research, and this event was a fantastic opportunity for us to strengthen and develop these relationships. In addition, the panel discussion stressed the relevance of ECRs in publishing. Going forward, the RMetS journal Meteorological Applications will have an early-career advisory board to better represent the opinions and needs of early-career scientists, and RMetS representatives explained their desire to increase the diversity of those involved in the publishing process. Furthermore, journal editors highlighted opportunities for less experienced scientists to become involved in the peer review process; the editors recommended that early-career scientists ensure that supervisors or managers are aware of any interest they have in peer reviewing so that they can recommend the ECR as a reviewer if they do not have time to review an article. It was also fascinating to hear reflections on the future of publishing, especially if we hope to stay in the field of meteorology, as the publishing environment changes over the coming years and decades. In summary, it was particularly valuable to participate in this event because of the high-quality historical presentations, the practical advice from experts in the publishing industry, and the opportunity to network with other meteorologists. The cake (Figure 1) was simply a bonus. Keith Shine: Writing – original draft; writing – review and editing. Francesca Morris: Writing – original draft; writing – review and editing.

rayyan-224218254,2023: A year of success in the climate change battle or a missed opportunity?,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"From 30 November to 12 December 2023, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) 28th Conference of the Parties (COP28) was held in the United Arab Emirates. This World Climate Action Summit brought together 154 Heads of State and Government. In the very final stage of the Summit, the Parties reached several important agreements including operationalization of the loss and damage fund reinforcing the role of children and youth as agents of change through the Presidency youth climate champion, to operationalizing the transition from the fossil fuel use, emissions cuts, and scaled-up financing arrangements (United Nations COP 28, 2024). According to many observers and commentators, the agreements, which aim at more decisive climate action before the end of the decade to keep the global temperature limit of 1.5°C, imply recognition that global greenhouse gas emissions need to be cut 43% by 2030, compared to 2019 levels, to achieve that goal. This includes accelerating efforts towards the phase-down of unabated coal power, phasing out inefficient fossil fuel subsidies, and other measures that drive the transition away from fossil fuels in energy systems. The direction towards more equitable development, with developed countries continuing to take the lead, is suggested as the path to achieving those ambitious goals, and if possible, closer to 2025 (1 year from now!). Other researchers note that the urgent phasing out of fossil fuels is necessary but not sufficient. Mazzucato et al. (2023) consider that even if we could decarbonize the economy tomorrow, we would still not have a sustainable future until we take steps to maintain water systems and natural habitats. The authors argue that there is scientific evidence that ""nature loss on its own can send us crashing through the Paris climate agreement's target of limiting global warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels, ushering in a world where millions of people in vulnerable environments would no longer be able to adapt"". Further, ""(t)he increasingly well-documented links between climate change, biodiversity loss, and water insecurity point to a fundamental issue: our economic systems are based on flawed thinking. We are forever reacting to market failures when we should be pursuing proactive strategies to shape the economy for the common good"" (Ibid). We have called attention to the major connections of water with the sustainable development process and goals, from our very first Editorial in 2014 (Neto & Camkin, 2014) to the central role of water in adapting to climate change in 2023 (Camkin & Neto, 2023). Safeguarding water resources and biodiversity cannot be done without decarbonization. The unbalanced way water and its resources have been used everywhere, within a frame of uncontrolled exhaustion of the environment and the services it provides, has undoubtedly contributed to the intensification of climatic extremes. 2023 was the hottest year on record (EC, 2023), with critical rising temperatures, serious fires in many countries, and floods in many regions. In 2023, we saw how all these extremes are having an increasing impact on already vulnerable populations, and communities, making more people homeless and increasing the number of climate refugees. Amongst the gloom, there is lots of positive action. In Europe, for example, the European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS) were enforced from 1st January 2024, obligating all companies to report water risks across their operations and value chains. This mandatory reporting on water aims to help companies understand (1) the material risks and opportunities arising from their dependence on water; (2) the impacts a company's activities may have on water resources; and (3) the actions a company is taking to prevent negative impacts and contribute to broader EU water objectives (ESRS, 2023). Of course, no single action is enough to match the huge and intrinsically interconnected challenges; water-related issues can no longer be ignored in any context. The challenge is not small, or dispensable. The water cycle, its territorial links, the environment, economic uses and resources, governance—in a word—require competence and strategic vision. Both are not abundant, unfortunately, which demands multiplied efforts from the real agents for change. Given the scale of climate changes and their effects, the latest COP 28 can bring some light to the path. But it is not an entirely optimistic outlook when we look at what is effectively happening. Actors around the world cry for clearer actions for decarbonization, but sadly, many of the fossil fuel-based activities continue to be supported and strongly financed in many regions, despite the Paris Agreement and the final decisions of the Conference of the Parties in Dubai at the end of last year. As pointed out by several agencies, many countries ""are still aiming at peaking their fossil fuel use in the next years, … and countries that have ratified and agreed upon the European Union targets and the new EU Directives, still subsidize fossil fuels"" (Oikonomou, 2023). For example, in Greece, three environmental organizations have filed a formal complaint to the European Commission against Greece for systematically giving a free pass to oil and gas drilling off the Greek coasts, in breach of EU and national laws. Because COP28 was so important, we have invited Sarah Ransom, General Manager of the Australian Water Partnership, to write a Guest Editorial for this issue, entitled Returning from Dubai: Reflections on Water in the Climate Conference. Sarah provides many relevant insights into the realities of COP28, building upon her experience of also attending previous COPs. Sarah concludes that ""there is an opportunity ahead for the water community to make a significant contribution both to the fight for 1.5°C, and to ensure our skills and knowledge help communities and ecosystems to build resilience and adapt where needed, following the UN call for the water professionals to play a part on climate action in this critical decade."" The next 18 papers deal with a wide range of water issues, all linked to the need to improve the connection between research, policy, practice, and learning, particularly in the rapidly changing global context. In the paper, Is the Media Missing the Point on the Transnational American Desalination Pipe Dream? Brian F. O'Neill uses the example of large-scale seawater desalination in the southwest USA and Mexico to explore the role that media plays in the dissemination of information about globally significant transboundary issues like water policy and infrastructure projects. Drawing on experiences from Kazakhstan and elsewhere, Nurlan Apakhayev and co-authors report on their investigation into criminal offenses relating to water bodies and propose the development of new strategies and programs aimed at countering such crimes in Problems of Prevention of Criminal Offenses Related to the Use of Water Resources. Water quality management features strongly in this issue of WWP. Taking into consideration both the environmental limits specified by Egyptian legislation and industry-specific parameters, Doaa Abdou and Eid El—Ragehy propose an Industrial Water Quality Index in Unlocking Solutions for Cleaner Waters: The Industrial Wastewater Quality Index (IWQI) in Egypt and Beyond. In a book review Exploring Groundwater-Climate Change Interactions: A Critical Review of Groundwater and Climate Change: Multi-Level Law and Policy Perspectives by Philippe Cullet, Kulsum Fatima examines the key arguments presented, critically analyzing the book's contribution to the field of environmental law and policy, particularly relating to the interactions between climate change and groundwater. Returning to North America, Holly Wilts, David Burton and Aitazaz Farooque discuss the efficacy of various riparian buffer zone configurations and identify optimal buffers to protect surface water from contamination in A Comparison of Riparian Buffer Designs Incorporating Short-rotation Salix viminalis to Mitigate Surface Water Pollution in the Dunk River Watershed on Prince Edward Island. In Rainfall Extremes and Trends During the Little Dry Season in Nigeria, Joseph Omoniyi Adejuwon then presents an analysis of the ""little dry season"" in Nigeria—a dry spell amid the wet season—which is a phenomenon of interest in West Africa because of its impacts on agriculture and food production. Vishal Narain and Chanda Goodrich analyze the reasons for the limited impact of efforts for gender mainstreaming in the water sector in South Asia in their discussion paper, Glass Half Empty or Half Full? Gender in Integrated Water Resource Management in South Asia, noting that reserving seats for women in local patriarchal structures of decision-making does little to alter the status quo. Taking lessons from the experiences of riparian countries such as the Mekong River and common legal frameworks on international water law, Hoa Thanh Ha and Tuan Van Vu discuss the urgent need to establish a specialized international water management commission in their paper Urgent Call for Protection and Use of Transboundary Watercourses. Some Legal Reflections. Noting that rapid and frequent mapping of flood areas is crucial for monitoring and mitigating flood disasters, Sainath Reddy Poli and R. Bhavani's paper Assessment of Flood in Nandigama, Andhra Pradesh, Using Hydrological and Hydraulic Models reports on flood inundation mapping in Nandigama and its implications for the planning and management of flood control infrastructure. With soil erosion being a big challenge in Ethiopia due to the high expansion of agricultural activity and poor land-use management, Eyasu Tafese Mekuria's paper Sediment Yield Assessment and Suggesting Mitigation Measures: A Case Study of Deme Watershed, Omo-Gibe Basin, Ethiopia reports on sediment yield assessments and suggests mitigation measures that could reduce sediment yield by up to 90%. Amit Kumar Sharma and co-authors address the increasingly popular use of bio-indicators in water resource management in their article A Review on Plankton as a Bio-indicator: A Promising Tool for Monitoring Water Quality, highlighting recent research on the opportunities a range of planktons present for water quality management. Continuing with the water quality theme, the article Evaluating the Structures and Arrangements of Water Institutions to Include In-stream Modelling for Water Quality Management and Control Pollution: Insights from the Awash Basin, Ethiopia by Eskinder Zinabu and co-authors critically analyses existing models and the supporting environment, and suggest changes needed to improve institutional capacity. In their paper, Severity of Natural Calamities and Crop Yield Prediction Using Hybrid Deep Learning Model in Uttar Pradesh, Rajneesh Kumar and Rajendra Prasad Mahapatra discuss weaknesses in methods of predicting crop yields and propose approaches that better incorporate natural calamities such as drought, hail, and storm severity to support real-time agricultural practices and water quality protection. El Khoumsi Wafae and co-authors show that irrigation using treated wastewater generally promotes better growth in their article Effect of Treated Wastewater Irrigation on Ornamental Plants: Case Study of Lantana and Hibiscus, Morocco, highlighting the potential for a combination of treated wastewater and subsurface drip irrigation for irrigation of green spaces. Nepal has a high annual rainfall, but it still faces numerous challenges in ensuring good water quality. In the paper, An Analysis of Drinking Water Quality Parameters to Achieve Sustainable Development Goals in Rural and Urban Areas of Besisahar, Lamjung, Nepal, Mahendra Aryal reports on an analysis of 27 water samples taken from a variety of water sources with the results suggesting the need for great involvement of governments and developments in water resource management to ensure sustainability. Alebachew Shumye Moges and Sisay Assefa Wondimagegn then take us back to Ethiopia with their article, Evaluate the Effectiveness of Soil and Water Conservation Interventions in the Upper Awash Basin, Ethiopia, in which they survey community attitudes and assess the effectiveness of different conservation methods in enhancing soil physicochemical properties, reducing soil loss and erosion, and maximizing land productivity. In Assessing Groundwater Quality, Health Risks and Policy Implications: A Case Study of West Medinipur District, West Bengal, India, Md Anjar Alam, Damodhara Rao Mailapalli and Basant Maheshwari discuss the potential health risks, highlighting the complexity of groundwater quality and the need for comprehensive water policy and management strategies. Finally, Bitew K. Dessie and co-authors draw upon previous and current research to report on Pollution Challenges and Consequences of the Akaki Catchment, Upper Awash Basin, Ethiopia: Evidence for Policy Reform and Action. Finding that despite good laws and standards at federal and regional levels, environmental pollution is not being prevented because of ineffective implementation or enforcement, the authors recommend a set of specific and urgent policy measures. Thank you to all our authors and to the numerous reviewers who volunteered their time to support this issue of World Water Policy. We trust you will enjoy reading this rich collection of insights from around the world into water policy, practice, and the learning that supports them. We look forward to your contributions in the future. Our best wishes Susana Neto, Jeff Camkin 2023年11月30日至12月12日, 联合国气候变化框架公约(UNFCCC)第二十八次缔约方大会(COP28)在阿联酋举行, 本届世界气候行动峰会汇聚了154位国家元首和政府首脑。在峰会的最后阶段, 各方达成了几项重要协议, 包括""损失和损害""基金的操作化, 通过主席团青年气候倡导者加强儿童和青少年作为变革推动者的作用, 以及对""化石燃料使用的过渡 、减排和融资安排扩大""的操作化。 许多观察者和评论员认为, 这些协议(旨在于2030年之前采取更果断的气候行动, 以期将全球气温上升限制在1.5度以内)意味着对一个观点的认可, 即与 2019 年的水平相比, 2030年全球温室气体排放量需要减少43%才能实现这一目标。这包括加快逐步淘汰有增无减的煤电、逐步取消低效的化石燃料补贴, 以及加快一系列在能源系统中推动化石燃料转型的其他措施。建议以""发达国家继续带头的更加公平的发展方向""作为实现这些宏伟目标的路径, 如果可能的话, 在更接近2025年的时间内完成这些目标(即一年后!)。 其他研究人员指出, 紧急逐步淘汰化石燃料是必要的, 但还不够。Mazzucato等人(2023)认为, 即使我们明天就能实现经济脱碳, 但除非我们采取措施维护水系统和自然栖息地, 否则我们仍然不会拥有可持续的未来。作者论证, 有科学证据表明, ""自然损失本身就可能使我们无法实现巴黎气候协议的目标(即将全球变暖限制在比工业化前水平高1.5°C的范围内), 从而导致数百万生活在脆弱环境中的人将无法再适应""。此外, ""气候变化、生物多样性丧失和水不安全之间越来越明显的联系指出了一个根本问题:我们的经济系统建立在有缺陷的思维之上。当我们应该采取积极主动的战略来塑造经济以实现共同利益时, 我们却一直只对市场失灵作出反应""(同上)。 从 2014 年第一篇社论(Neto & Camkin, 2014)到 2023 年水在气候变化适应中的核心作用(Camkin & Neto, 2023), 我们一直呼吁人们关注水与可持续发展过程及目标的主要联系。如果没有脱碳, 就无法保护水资源和生物多样性。在环境及其提供的服务不受控制地枯竭的框架下, 各地对水及水资源的使用方式不平衡, 这无疑加剧了极端气候。2023年是有史以来最热的一年, 气温急剧上升, 许多国家发生严重火灾, 许多地区发生洪水。2023年, 我们看到所有这些极端情况如何对本已脆弱的人群和社区产生越来越大的影响, 使更多人无家可归, 并增加气候难民的数量。 这一困难下也出现了许多积极行动。例如, 在欧洲, 《欧洲可持续发展报告标准》(ESRS)自2024年1月1日起强制执行, 要求所有公司报告其运营和价值链中的水风险。这项关于水的强制性报告旨在帮助企业理解(1)由于对水的依赖而产生的重大风险和机遇;(2)公司的活动可能对水资源造成的影响;(3)公司为防止负面影响并促进更广泛的欧盟水目标而采取的行动(ESRS 2023)。 当然, 任何单一行动都不足以应对巨大且内在相互关联的挑战;在任何情况下都不能再忽视与水有关的问题。挑战不小, 并且是必要的。水循环、其领土联系、环境、经济用途和资源、治理——总而言之——需要能力和战略眼光。不幸的是, 能力和战略眼光都不充足, 这要求真正的变革行动者付出加倍的努力。 考虑到气候变化的规模及其影响, 最新的COP 28能为道路带来一丝曙光。但当我们审视正在发生的事情时, 这并不是一个完全乐观的前景。世界各地的行动者呼吁采取更明确的脱碳行动, 但遗憾的是, 尽管《巴黎协定》和去年底迪拜COP大会作出了最终决策, 许多地区仍继续支持和大力资助以化石燃料为基础的诸多活动。正如一些机构指出的那样, 许多国家""仍致力于在未来几年达到化石燃料使用的峰值……而已经批准并同意欧盟目标和新欧盟指令的国家仍然对化石燃料提供补贴""(Oikonomou, 2023)。例如, 在希腊, 三个环保组织已向欧盟委员会提出正式投诉, 指控希腊系统性地为希腊海岸附近的石油天然气钻探提供免费通行证, 违反了欧盟和国家法律。 由于COP28如此重要, 我们邀请了澳大利亚水伙伴关系总经理Sarah Ransom为本期撰写一篇客座社论, 题为《从迪拜归来:气候会议中对水的反思》。Sarah基于她参加过往COP大会的经历, 对COP28的现实情况提供了许多相关见解。Sarah总结道:""水社区有机会在两方面作出重大贡献, 第一, 通过快速发展的举措量化其对气候缓解的贡献, 并支持能源转型, 将全球变暖控制在1.5度内(UN Water, 2023), 第二, 确保我们的技能和知识帮助社区和生态系统建立复原力并在需要时进行适应。"" 接下来的18篇论文涉及广泛的水问题, 它们都与""改善研究、政策、实践和学习之间的联系""这一需求有关, 特别是在快速变化的全球情境下。 在《媒体是否没有真正理解美国的跨国海水淡化厂白日梦?》这篇论文中, Brian F. O'Neill以美国西南部和墨西哥的大规模海水淡化为例, 探究了媒体在传播""水政策和基础设施项目等全球重大跨边界问题""信息中所发挥的作用。在《与水资源利用相关的刑事犯罪预防问题》一文中, Nurlan Apakhayev和合著者借鉴哈萨克斯坦和其他地方的经验, 报告了他们对与水体有关的刑事犯罪的调查情况, 并提出制定一系列旨在打击此类犯罪的新战略和项目。水质管理是本期《全球水政策》(WWP)的重点内容。考虑到埃及立法规定的环境限制和行业特定参数, Doaa Abdou和Eid El–Ragehy在《解锁清洁水源的解决方案:埃及及其他地区的工业废水质量指数(IWQI)》一文中提出了一项工业水质指数。在题为《探究地下水与气候变化的相互作用:关于Philippe Cullet所著的⟨地下水与气候变化:多层次法律与政策视角⟩的批判性评论》的书评中, Kulsum Fatima分析了所提出的关键论点, 批判分析了该书对环境法和政策领域的贡献, 特别是与""气候变化和地下水之间的相互作用""有关的方面。 将焦点转回到北美, Holly Wilts、David Burton和Aitazaz Farooque在《结合短期轮作蒿柳的河岸缓冲区设计比较:缓解爱德华王子岛Dunk河流域的地表水污染》一文中探讨了不同河岸缓冲区配置的效能, 并识别了保护地表水免受污染的最佳缓冲区。在《尼日利亚小旱季期间的极端降雨和趋势》一文中, Joseph Omoniyi Adejuwon对尼日利亚的""小旱季""(雨季中的旱季)进行了分析, 这在西非是一种有趣的现象, 因为其对农业和粮食生产造成了影响。Vishal Narain和Chanda Goodrich在题为《玻璃杯是半空还是半满?南亚水资源综合管理中的性别问题》的讨论文中分析了南亚水务部门性别主流化举措影响力有限的原因, 指出了在地方父权式决策结构中为妇女保留席位一事对于改变现状几乎没有作用。 借鉴湄公河等沿岸国家的经验以及国际水法的共同立法框架, Hoa Thanh Ha和Tuan Van Vu在其论文《迫切呼吁对跨边界水道的保护和利用:一些立法反思》中讨论了""建立专门的国际水管理委员会""这一迫切需要。通过指出快速且频繁的洪水区制图对于监测和减轻洪水灾害而言至关重要, Sainath Reddy Poli和R. Bhavani在题为《安得拉邦 Nandigama 区域的洪水评估:使用水文和水力模型》的论文中报告了Nandigama洪水淹没制图及其对""规划和管理防洪基础设施""的启示。由于农业活动的高度扩张和土地使用管理不善, 土壤侵蚀成为埃塞俄比亚的一大挑战, 鉴于此, Eyasu Tafese Mekuria的论文《沉积物产量评估和缓解措施建议:埃塞俄比亚奥莫-吉贝盆地Deme流域案例研究》报告了沉积物产量评估并提出了一系列可将沉积物产量减少高达90%的缓解措施。 Amit Kumar Sharma和合著者在题为《关于浮游生物作为生物指示剂的述评:一项监测水质的有用工具》的文章中研究了生物指示剂在水资源管理中越来越多的使用, 并强调了关于一系列浮游生物为水质管理提供机遇的近期研究。继续围绕水质主题, Eskinder Zinabu及其合著者撰写的《评估水机构的结构和安排, 以提出用于水质管理和污染控制的河道内建模:来自埃塞俄比亚阿瓦什流域的见解》一文批判性分析了现有模型和支持环境, 并提出""提高机构能力""一事所需的变革。Rajneesh Kumar和Rajendra Prasad Mahapatra在其论文《使用混合深度学习模型预测北方邦自然灾害的严重程度和作物产量》中探讨了作物产量预测方法的缺点, 并提出了一系列用于更好地结合自然灾害(干旱、冰雹)与风暴严重程度的方法, 以支持实时农业实践与水质保护。El Khoumsi Wafae和合著者在其文章《处理后的废水灌溉对观赏植物的影响:以摩洛哥的马缨丹和朱槿为例》中表明, 使用处理过的废水进行灌溉通常会促进更好的生长, 强调了处理过的废水和地下滴灌相结合的潜力, 以用于绿地灌溉。 尼泊尔年降雨量高, 但在确保良好水质方面仍面临诸多挑战。在题为《分析尼泊尔拉姆琼贝西萨哈农村和城市地区的饮用水质参数, 以实现可持续发展目标》的论文中, Mahendra Aryal报告了一项对""来自不同水源的27个水样""的分析, 结果表明, 需要政府大力参与水资源管理和一系列发展, 以确保可持续性。Alebachew Shumye Moges和Sisay Assefa Wondimagegn将我们带回埃塞俄比亚, 他们的文章题为《评价埃塞俄比亚上阿瓦什盆地水土保持干预措施的有效性》。文章调查了社区态度并评估了不同保护方法在增强土壤理化特性、减少水土流失和侵蚀、以及最大限度提高土地生产力方面的有效性。在《评估地下水质、健康风险和政策启示:印度西孟加拉邦西梅迪尼布尔县案例研究》一文中, Md Anjar Alam、Damodhara Rao Mailapalli和Basant Maheshwari探讨了潜在的健康风险, 强调了地下水质的复杂性以及""全面的水政策和管理战略""的必要性。最后, Bitew K. Dessie和合著者在《埃塞俄比亚上阿瓦什盆地阿卡基流域的污染挑战和结果:政策改革与行动的证据》一文中对以往和当前的研究进行了报告。作者发现, 尽管联邦和地区层面有良好的法律和标准, 但由于实施或执行不力, 环境污染并未得到预防, 因此建议采取一套具体而紧急的政策措施。 感谢我们所有的作者以及众多自愿花时间支持本期《世界水政策》的审稿人。我们相信您会享受阅读本期内容, 受益于来自世界各地的、""关于水政策、实践以及支持它们的学习""的丰富见解。. 我们期待您的投稿。 献上最美好的祝愿 Susana Neto, Jeff Camkin 关键词 气候变化, COP 28, 水质, 水政策与实践, 水资源综合管理, 水政策. Del 30 de noviembre al 12 de diciembre de 2023 se celebró en los Emiratos Árabes Unidos la 28 Conferencia de las Partes (COP28) de la Convención Marco de las Naciones Unidas sobre el Cambio Climático (CMNUCC), esta Cumbre Mundial sobre Acción Climática reunió a 154 Jefes de Estado y de Gobierno. En la etapa final de la Cumbre, las Partes alcanzaron varios acuerdos importantes, incluida la puesta en funcionamiento del fondo para pérdidas y daños, que refuerza el papel de los niños y los jóvenes como agentes de cambio a través del liderazgo juvenil climático de la Presidencia, hasta la puesta en práctica de la transición desde el uso de combustibles fósiles, recortes de emisiones y acuerdos de financiación ampliados. Según muchos observadores y comentaristas, los acuerdos, que apuntan a una acción climática más decisiva antes del final de la década para mantener el límite de temperatura global de 1,5°C, implican el reconocimiento de que las emisiones globales de gases de efecto invernadero deben reducirse en un 43% para 2030. en comparación con los niveles de 2019, para lograr ese objetivo. Esto incluye acelerar los esfuerzos hacia la reducción gradual de la energía a base de carbón, eliminar gradualmente los subsidios ineficientes a los combustibles fósiles y otras medidas que impulsen la transición para alejarse de los combustibles fósiles en los sistemas energéticos. Se sugiere que la dirección hacia un desarrollo más equitativo, en el que los países desarrollados sigan a la cabeza, es el camino para alcanzar esos ambiciosos objetivos y, si es posible, más cerca de 2025 (¡dentro de un año!). Otros investigadores señalan que la urgente eliminación gradual de los combustibles fósiles es necesaria pero no suficiente. Mazzucato et al. (2023) consideran que incluso si pudiéramos descarbonizar la economía mañana, todavía no tendríamos un futuro sostenible hasta que tomemos medidas para mantener los sistemas hídricos y los hábitats naturales. Los autores sostienen que existe evidencia científica de que ""la pérdida de naturaleza por sí sola puede hacernos fracasar en el objetivo del acuerdo climático de París de limitar el calentamiento global a 1,5°C por encima de los niveles preindustriales, marcando el comienzo de un mundo donde millones de personas en entornos vulnerables ya no podría adaptarse"". Además, ""los vínculos cada vez más documentados entre el cambio climático, la pérdida de biodiversidad y la inseguridad hídrica apuntan a una cuestión fundamental: nuestros sistemas económicos se basan en un pensamiento erróneo. Siempre estamos reaccionando a las fallas del mercado cuando deberíamos buscar estrategias proactivas para configurar la economía para el bien común"" (Ibid). Hemos llamado la atención sobre las principales conexiones del agua con el proceso y los objetivos de desarrollo sostenible, desde nuestro primer editorial en 2014 (Neto y Camkin, 2014) hasta el papel central del agua en la adaptación al cambio climático en 2023 (Camkin & Neto, 2023). La salvaguardia de los recursos hídricos y la biodiversidad no se puede lograr sin la descarbonización. El uso desequilibrado del agua y sus recursos en todas partes, en un marco de agotamiento incontrolado del medio ambiente y de los servicios que éste proporciona, ha contribuido sin duda a la intensificación de los extremos climáticos. 2023 fue el año más caluroso jamás registrado (CE, 2023), con un aumento crítico de las temperaturas, incendios graves en muchos países e inundaciones en muchas regiones. En 2023 vimos cómo todos estos extremos están teniendo un impacto cada vez mayor en poblaciones y comunidades que ya son vulnerables, dejando a más personas sin hogar y aumentando el número de refugiados climáticos. En medio de la oscuridad hay muchas acciones positivas. En Europa, por ejemplo, los Estándares Europeos de Informes de Sostenibilidad (ESRS) se aplicaron a partir del 1 de enero de 2024, lo que obliga a todas las empresas a informar los riesgos hídricos en sus operaciones y cadenas de valor. Este informe obligatorio sobre el agua tiene como objetivo ayudar a las empresas a comprender (1) los riesgos y oportunidades materiales que surgen de su dependencia del agua; (2) los impactos que las actividades de una empresa pueden tener en los recursos hídricos; y (3) las acciones que una empresa está tomando para prevenir impactos negativos y contribuir a los objetivos hídricos más amplios de la UE (ESRS 2023). Por supuesto, ninguna acción por sí sola es suficiente para hacer frente a los enormes desafíos intrínsecamente interconectados; Las cuestiones relacionadas con el agua ya no pueden ignorarse en ningún contexto. El desafío no es pequeño ni prescindible. El ciclo del agua, sus vínculos territoriales, el medio ambiente, los usos y recursos económicos, la gobernanza -en una palabra- requieren competencia y visión estratégica. Desafortunadamente, ambos no abundan, lo que exige esfuerzos multiplicados por parte de los verdaderos agentes del cambio. Dada la escala de los cambios climáticos y sus efectos, la última COP 28 puede arrojar algo de luz sobre el camino. Pero no es una perspectiva enteramente optimista cuando analizamos lo que efectivamente está sucediendo. Los actores de todo el mundo claman por acciones más claras para la descarbonización pero, lamentablemente, muchas de las actividades basadas en combustibles fósiles siguen siendo apoyadas y fuertemente financiadas en muchas regiones, a pesar del Acuerdo de París y las decisiones finales de la Conferencia de las Partes en Dubai en finales del año pasado. Como lo señalaron varias agencias, muchos países ""todavía apuntan a alcanzar el máximo uso de combustibles fósiles en los próximos años … y los países que han ratificado y acordado los objetivos de la Unión Europea y las nuevas directivas de la UE, todavía subsidian los combustibles fósiles"". (Oikonomou, 2023). Por ejemplo, en Grecia, tres organizaciones ambientalistas han presentado una queja formal ante la Comisión Europea contra Grecia por dar sistemáticamente vía libre a las perforaciones de petróleo y gas frente a las costas griegas, en violación de las leyes nacionales y de la UE. Debido a que la COP28 fue tan importante, invitamos a Sarah Ransom, Gerente General de Australian Water Partnership, a escribir un editorial invitado para esta edición, titulado Regresando de Dubai: Reflexiones sobre el agua en la Conferencia sobre el Clima. Sarah brinda muchas ideas relevantes sobre las realidades de la COP28, basándose en su experiencia de haber asistido también a COP anteriores. Sarah concluye que ""hay una oportunidad por delante para que la comunidad del agua haga una contribución significativa tanto a la lucha por los 1,5º C como para garantizar que nuestras habilidades y conocimientos ayuden a las comunidades y los ecosistemas a desarrollar resiliencia y adaptarse donde sea necesario, siguiendo el llamado de la ONU. que los profesionales del agua desempeñen un papel en la acción climática en esta década crítica"". Los siguientes 18 artículos abordan una amplia gama de cuestiones relacionadas con el agua, todas ellas vinculadas a la necesidad de mejorar la conexión entre la investigación, las políticas, la práctica y el aprendizaje, particularmente en el contexto global que cambia rápidamente. En el artículo, ¿Los medios no entienden la quimera transnacional estadounidense de la desalinización? Brian F. O'Neill utiliza el ejemplo de la desalinización de agua de mar a gran escala en el suroeste de Estados Unidos y México para explorar el papel que desempeñan los medios en la difusión de información sobre cuestiones transfronterizas de importancia mundial, como las políticas hídricas y los proyectos de infraestructura. Basándose en experiencias de Kazajstán y otros lugares, Nurlan Apakhayev y sus coautores informan sobre su investigación sobre delitos penales relacionados con masas de agua y proponen el desarrollo de nuevas estrategias y programas destinados a contrarrestar dichos delitos en Problemas de prevención de delitos penales relacionados con el uso. de Recursos Hídricos. La gestión de la calidad del agua ocupa un lugar destacado en este número de WWP. Teniendo en cuenta tanto los límites ambientales especificados por la legislación egipcia como los parámetros específicos de la industria, Doaa Abdou y Eid El—Ragehy proponen un índice de calidad del agua industrial para desbloquear soluciones para aguas más limpias: el índice de calidad de las aguas residuales industriales (IWQI) en Egipto y más allá. En una reseña del libro ""Exploring Groundwater-Climate Change Interactions: A Critical Review of Groundwater and Climate Change: Multi-Level Law and Policy Perspectives"" de Philippe Cullet, Kulsum Fatima examina los argumentos clave presentados, analizando críticamente la contribución del libro al campo del medio ambiente. Leyes y políticas, particularmente en relación con las interacciones entre el cambio climático y las aguas subterráneas. Al regresar a América del Norte, Holly Wilts, David Burton y Aitazaz Farooque discuten la eficacia de varias configuraciones de zonas de amortiguamiento ribereñas e identifican zonas de amortiguamiento óptimas para proteger el agua superficial de la contaminación en Una comparación de diseños de zonas de amortiguamiento ribereñas que incorporan Salix viminalis de rotación corta para mitigar la contaminación del agua superficial. en la cuenca del río Dunk en la Isla del Príncipe Eduardo. En Rainfall Extremes and TrendsDurante la pequeña estación seca en Nigeria, Joseph Omoniyi Adejuwon presenta a continuación un análisis de la ""pequeña estación seca"" en Nigeria -un período seco en medio de la estación húmeda- que es un fenómeno de interés en África occidental debido a su impactos en la agricultura y la producción de alimentos. Vishal Narain y Chanda Goodrich analizan las razones del impacto limitado de los esfuerzos por incorporar la perspectiva de género en el sector del agua en el sur de Asia en su documento de debate, ¿Vaso medio vacío o medio lleno? Género en la gestión integrada de los recursos hídricos en el sur de Asia, señalando que reservar puestos para las mujeres en las estructuras patriarcales locales de toma de decisiones contribuye poco a alterar el status quo. Tomando lecciones de las experiencias de países ribereños como el río Mekong y los marcos legales comunes sobre el derecho internacional del agua, Hoa Thanh Ha y Tuan Van Vu discuten la urgente necesidad de establecer una comisión internacional especializada en gestión del agua en su documento: Llamado urgente para la protección y uso de los recursos de agua transfronterizos: Algunas reflexiones jurídicas.

This study integrated random forest (RF), self-organizing map (SOM), and artificial neural network (ANN) techniques to assess water demand patterns and to develop a predictive model for the city of Fortaleza, Brazil. We performed the analysis at two spatial scales, with different level of information: census tracts (CTs) at the fine scale, and census blocks (CBs) at the coarse scale. At the CB scale, demand was modeled with socioeconomic, demographic, and household characteristics. The RF technique was applied to rank these variables, and the most relevant were used to cluster census blocks with SOMs. RFs and ANNs were used in an iterative approach to define the input variables for the predictive model with minimum redundancy. At the CT scale, demand was modeled using HDI and per capita income. Variables which assess the education level and economic aspects of households demonstrated a direct relationship with water demand. The analysis at the coarse scale provided more insight into the relationship between the variables; however, the predictive model performed better at the fine scale. This study demonstrates how data-driven models can be helpful for water management, especially in environments with strong socioeconomic inequalities, where urban planning decisions should be integrated and inclusive.","",https://doi.org/10.1061/(asce)wr.1943-5452.0001310,"",,

rayyan-224218411,Long-term Runoff Forecasting Models Based on the Teleconnection coupled with Machine Learning,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Runoff forecast with high precision is important for the efficient utilization of water resources and regional sustainable development, especially in the arid area. The monthly runoff of Changmabao (CMB) station has an upwards trend and an abrupt point in 1998. The impact factor analysis shows that it is highly correlated with the current precipitation and temperature in the wet season while the previous runoff and previous global land temperature in the dry season. Three models including the time-series decomposition model, the model based on teleconnection coupled with the support vector machine, and the model based on teleconnection coupled with the artificial neural network are used to predict the runoff of CMB station. An indicator &amp;amp;#946; is constructed with the correlation coefficient (R) and mean relative deviation (rBias) to evaluate the model performance more conveniently and intuitively. The results suggest that the model based on teleconnection coupled with the support vector machine preforms best.

This prediction may reveal the proclivity of the characteristic water quality according to the most recent water quality, shifting, and transformation rule of the pollutant in the watershed. The predictive capability of traditional models is constrained due to variability, complexity, uncertainty, inaccuracy, non-stationary, and the non-linear interactions of the water quality parameters. Since the middle of the 20th century, Artificial Intelligence (AI) approaches have been found efficient in bridging gaps, simulating, complementing deficiencies, and improving the precision of the predictive models in terms of multiple evaluation measures for better planning, design, deployment, and handling of multiple engineering systems. This article discusses the state-of-the-art implementation of AI in water quality prediction, the type of AI approaches, the techniques adopted include the knowledge-based system as well as literature and their potential future implementation in water quality modelling and prediction.

Motivated by the pressing need to understand, from a hydro-ecological perspective, how the dynamic nature of the hydrologic cycle will impact the environment in water-stressed regions, we implemented a novel approach that predicts precipitation spatio-temporal trends over the drought-burdened region of East Africa, based on other major hydrological components, such as vegetation water content (VWC), soil moisture (SM) and surface temperature (ST). The spatial patterns and characteristics of the inter-relations among the four aforementioned hydrologic variables were investigated over regions of East Africa characterized by different vegetation types and for various precipitation intensity rates during 2003-2011. To this end, we analyzed multi-year satellite microwave remote sensing observations of SM, ST, and VWC (derived from Naval Research Laboratory's WindSat radiometer) as well as their response to precipitation patterns (derived from NASA's TRMM 3B42 V7). We categorized precipitation into four bins (ranges) of intensity and trained five different state-of-the-art machine learning models for each of these categories. The models were then applied to predict the spatiotemporal precipitation dynamics over this complex region. Specifically, the Random Forest and Linear Regression models outperformed the others with the normalized mean absolute error being less than 27% for all of the categories. The characteristics of the predicted precipitation were in turn used to classify vegetation regimes in East Africa. Our results indicate significant discrepancies in the performance of the models with varying values in the predicting skill as well as their ability to accurately classify vegetation into different types. Our predictive models were able to forecast the three vegetation regimes, i.e., Forest/Woody Savanna, Savanna/Grasslands and Shrubland, with precision rate of at least 81% for all of the aforementioned precipitation bins.","",https://doi.org/10.3808/jei.202000427,"",,

rayyan-224218752,Deep Learning for Drought and Vegetation Health Modelling: Demonstrating the utility of an Entity-Aware LSTM,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Tools from the field of deep learning are being used more widely in hydrological science. The potential of these methods lies in the ability to generate interpretable and physically realistic forecasts directly from data, by utilising specific neural network architectures.&amp;amp;#160;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This approach offers two advantages which complement physically-based models. First, the interpretations can be checked against our physical understanding to ensure that where deep learning models produce accurate forecasts they do so for physically-defensible reasons. Second, in domains where our physical understanding is limited, data-driven methods offer an opportunity to direct attention towards physical explanations that are consistent with data. Both are important in demonstrating the utility of deep learning as a tool in hydrological science.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This work uses an Entity Aware LSTM (EALSTM; cf. Kratzert et al., 2019) to predict a satellite-derived vegetation health metric, the Vegetation Condition Index (VCI). We use a variety of data sources including reanalysis data (ERA-5), satellite products (NOAA Vegetation Condition Index) and blended products (CHIRPS precipitation). The fundamental approach is to determine how well we can forecast vegetation health from hydro-meteorological variables.&amp;amp;#160;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In order to demonstrate the value of this method we undertook a series of experiments using observed data from Kenya to evaluate model performance. Kenya has experienced a number of devastating droughts in recent decades. Since the 1970s there have been more than 10 drought events in Kenya, including droughts in 2010-2011 and 2016 (Haile et al 2019). The National Drought Monitoring Authority (NDMA) use satellite-derived vegetation health to determine the drought status of regions in Kenya.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;First, we compared our results to other statistical methods and a persistence-based baseline. Using RMSE and R-squared we demonstrate that the EALSTM is able to predict vegetation health with an improved accuracy compared with other approaches. We have also assessed the ability of the EALSTM to predict poor vegetation health conditions. While better than the persistence baseline the performance on the tails of the distribution requires further attention.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Second, we test the ability of our model to generalise results. We do this by training only with subsets of the data. This tests our model&amp;amp;#8217;s ability to make accurate forecasts when the model has not seen examples of the conditions we are predicting. Finally, we explore how we can use the EALSTM to better understand the physical realism of relations between hydro-climatic variables embedded within the trained neural network.&amp;amp;#160;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#160;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;References:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Gebremeskel, G., Tang, Q., Sun, S., Huang, Z., Zhang, X., &amp;amp; Liu, X.

However, these numerical simulators have difficulties representing precipitation events accurately, mainly due to limited spatial resolution when simulating multi-scale dynamics in the atmosphere. To improve the prediction of high resolution precipitation we apply a Deep Learning (DL) approach using an input of CM simulations of the model fields (weather variables) that are more predictable than local precipitation. To this end, we present TRU-NET (Temporal Recurrent U-Net), an encoder-decoder model featuring a novel 2D cross attention mechanism between contiguous convolutional-recurrent layers to effectively model multi-scale spatio-temporal weather processes. We use a conditional-continuous loss function to capture the zero-skewed %extreme event patterns of rainfall. Experiments show that our model consistently attains lower RMSE and MAE scores than a DL model prevalent in short term precipitation prediction and improves upon the rainfall predictions of a state-of-the-art dynamical weather model. Moreover, by evaluating the performance of our model under various, training and testing, data formulation strategies, we show that there is enough data for our deep learning approach to output robust, high-quality results across seasons and varying regions.","",,"",,

In Alpine regions, fires are often at the start of cascading risks including avalanches, mudslides or rock fall due to the loss of forest and vegetation layers. Additionally, wildfires are expected to occur more frequently in the future as a result of a warming climate, which is estimated to affect alpine regions in particular.&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span&amp;gt;Fire danger forecasts, such as the commonly used Fire Weather indices, indicate the danger of forest fires based on numerical weather forecasts. Such indices are typically available at coarse spatial resolutions and, hence, have limited use in mountainous regions with their highly variable weather and other environmental conditions. Stakeholders, such as fire departments and forest managers, require more detailed forecasts in order to make robust decisions and efficiently plan their resources. The CONFIRM project, which started in December 2019 with funding from the Austrian Research Promotion Agency (FFG) under the Austrian Space Applications Programme (ASAP), addresses this gap by using high-resolution earth observation data provided by the European Copernicus programme to develop a pre-operational fire danger forecast system.&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span&amp;gt;Data from both optical and microwave sensors aboard satellites are known to be sensitive to changes in soil and vegetation water content.

The estimates will be integrated with airborne Laser-scanning (LiDAR) data, high-resolution weather forecasts, socioeconomic and topographic data to develop a novel, high-resolution integrated forest fire danger system (IFDS) for Austria. The project team will apply its expertise in forest management, remote sensing, fire science and machine learning to estimate fire danger using the Austrian fire database, an extensive record of historic fire events, as a training dataset. Key stakeholders from national weather services (ZAMG, DWD), fire brigades, state forest administrations and infrastructure providers (Austrian Railways &amp;amp;#214;BB) are continuously involved in the project to develop the IFDS according to their requirements.

In this study, we collected water quality data including 24 routine monitoring parameters during 2014-2019 from over 100 monitoring stations located along the Yellow River. After assessing the water quality grade for each section according to the Environmental Quality Standards for Surface Water in China, we identified the key parameters that affect the water quality condition of the basin. The spatial and temporal variations of the key water quality parameters, in particular the relationships with driving factors which include natural factors (i.e., precipitation, temperature and evaporation) as well as anthropogenic factors (i.e., land cover and land use, pollution emission, population and social economy), were presented by conducting correlation analysis. Furthermore, based on the characteristics of the water quality time series and the significances of the driving factors to water quality, we built several data-driven models to predict the water quality condition at a monthly scale for the Yellow River basin, such as seasonal autoregressive model (SAR), multivariate linear regression (MLR) and artificial neural network (ANN), while the performances of those models were evaluated.

These flow control sensors will update the flow periodically to the intelligent monitor system. The intelligent monitor system will analyze the sensor data with the current water limit of each distribution as well as the data from the water level sensor of the underground tank. Similarly, the high-rate pressure sensor will periodically update the pressure over the pipe.

The category system was also used for creating large-scale (1:10.000) water management maps, which are contained legally by expert&amp;amp;#8217;s reports prepared on the subject of drainage, irrigation, liquid manure, sewage or sewage-sludge disposal. These maps were prepared eventually, essentially for individual plots and are not managed centrally and are not available for further applications.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Recently a 3D Soil Hydraulic Database was elaborated for Europe at 250 m resolution based on specific pedotransfer functions and soil property maps of SoilGrids. The database includes spatial information on the soil water content at the most frequently used matric potential values, saturated hydraulic conductivity, Mualem-van Genuchten parameters of the moisture retention and hydraulic conductivity curves. Based on similar idea, the work has been continued to produce more accurate and spatially more detailed hydrophysical maps in Hungary by generalizing the applied pedotransfer functions and using national soil reference data and high resolution, novel, digital soil property maps.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;We initiated a study in order to formalize the built-in soil-landscape model(s) of the national legacy map on water management, together with the quantification of its categories and its potential disaggregation.

Hydrological and primary soil property maps were used as predictor variables. Unsupervised classifications were performed for spatial-thematic aggregation of the soil hydraulic datasets to identify their intrinsic characteristics, which were used for the elaboration of a renewed water management classification. Hydrological interpretation of the categories provided by the optimum classifications has been carried out (i) by their spatial cross-tabulation with the categories of the legacy map and (ii) using the interval estimation of the applied soil hydraulic properties provided for the individual water management categories.

The study area&amp;amp;#8722;West Nile Delta&amp;amp;#8722;is an important region in Egypt in terms of agricultural and industrial productions, whilst it is a vulnerable area facing extreme weather and environmental crises (e.g. flooding, soil salinization, and sea level rise), as well as in socio-economic respect. In the latest decades, the region suffered more weather extremes due to climate change; the severe rainfall events resulted in flooding causing heavy casualties and economic loss. Therefore, the project aims to build an integrated flood early warning system for Egypt. However, in order to tackle the issue of data scarcity of ground observation, this research seeks to apply satellite precipitation observation and numerical weather prediction (NWP) as the substitution (i.e. GPM, MPE and ECMWF data) and to develop an approach with the integration of Nowcasting and NWP for precipitation forecasting.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Generally known that Nowcasting method and NWP both have limitations in performing local convective and formative precipitations, whilst in different reasons. The research seeks to improve this effect in Nowcasting as it has advantage in short term performance (i.e. a few hours) whilst NWP has advantage in long term performance (i.e. a few days). The findings from the vector field of Nowcasting indicate that the relativity between shift speed and shape changing speed of precipitation is the key for accurate prediction, which is the disadvantage of the optical flow approach of the Lagrangian method that Nowcasting applies as the main stream core. The research hence applies a machine learning approach&amp;amp;#8722;support vector machine (SVM)&amp;amp;#8722;to figure out the relativity aforementioned to identify disadvantage data that needs to be pre-treated prior to the Lagrangian Nowcasting. Meanwhile, by applying a phase-based frame interpolation method based on the Eulerian method to downscale the temporal resolution, it can improve these disadvantage data identified by machine learning so as to better perform in the Lagrangian Nowcasting. The integrated Nowcasting approach is expected to have better performance in forecasting and still retains low computational resource consumption.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu2020-11380,"",,
rayyan-224218971,Projection and prediction of heat waves for an arid region in the context of climate change,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Forecasting temperature extremes especially heat waves are extremely important for developing preparedness and planning mitigation measures, particularly in the context of climate change. The major objective of the present study was to assess the ongoing changes and possible future changes in heat waves and development of robust statistical model for forecasting heat wave which can adapt with changing climate. Pakistan, which is one of the most affected countries of the world to heat waves in recent years was considered as the study area. Novelties of the study are the methods proposed for defining heat waves, reliable projection of heat waves with associated uncertainties, and development of robust forecasting models which can adapt with climate change. Available in-situ temperature records, gauge-based gridded temperature data and temperature simulations of general circulation data (GCM) of Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) were used for defining heat waves and assessment of historical changes and future projections of temperature extremes and heat waves, while the reanalysis atmospheric data of National Centres for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) was used for the development of heat wave forecasting models. A threshold-based approach which able to demarcate the historical heat wave affected area is proposed for defining heat waves, GCMs were selected based on their capability to simulate different characteristics of heat waves and different state-of-the-art machine learning methods (ML) were used for the development of the seasonal and daily heat wave forecasting models. The study revealed that the daily maximum temperature more than 95-th percentile threshold for consecutive five days or more can well reconstruct the spatial pattern of heat wave in Pakistan. The assessment of trends in heat waves based on the derived definition revealed increase in heat wave duration and affected area in Pakistan at a rate of 0.71 days/decade and 1.36% of the total area of Pakistan per decade respectively. Four GCMs namely, CCSM4, CESM1(BGC), CMCC-CM and NorESM1-M were found to have better ability for the projection of all the characteristics of heat waves. The projection of heat waves using the selected GCMs revealed a high increase in the heat wave indices particularly for representative concentration pathways (RCP) 8.5. Heat wave frequency was projected to increase up to 12 events per year in most parts of the country, while some areas would experience heat waves for more than 100 days in a year. The higher increase in heat waves indices was projected in highly populated eastern and southern coastal regions which are already prone to high occurrence of heat waves. Forecasting models were developed for the prediction of triggering date and seasonal number of heat waves days in order to aid in coping and mitigation capacity revealed that the Quantile Regression Forests (QRF) models were able to forecast the triggering and departure dates of heat waves with an accuracy of up to ±5 days. On the other hand, the Support Vector (SVM) model was found to have the higher skills in forecasting number of heat wave days with a month time-lag (R2: 0.89- 0.9, NRMSE%: 32.6-31.8, rSD: 0.98-0.96, and md: 0.8). The analysis of synoptic patterns revealed that the wind vectors, relative humidity and geopotential height are the most potential indicators of heat waves in Pakistan. The forward-rolling based forecasting model proposed for the prediction of heat waves to accommodate the changing pattern of the atmospheric variables responsible for heat waves due to the changes in climate was found to forecast heat waves reliably.","",,"",,
rayyan-224218977,Modeling of groundwater table depth anomalies using Long Short-Term Memory networks over Europe,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Groundwater is the dominant source of fresh water in many European countries. However, due to a lack of near-real-time water table depth (wtd) observations, monitoring of groundwater resources is not feasible at the continental scale. Thus, an alternative approach is required to produce wtd data from other available observations near-real-time. In this study, we propose Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to model monthly wtd anomalies over Europe utilizing monthly precipitation anomalies as input. LSTM networks are a special type of artificial neural networks, showing great promise in exploiting long-term dependencies between time series, which is expected in the response of groundwater to precipitation. To establish the methodology, spatially and temporally continuous data from terrestrial simulations at the continental scale were applied with a spatial resolution of 0.11&amp;amp;#176;, ranging from the year 1996 to 2016 (Furusho-Percot et al., 2019). They were divided into a training set (1996 &amp;amp;#8211; 2012), a validation set (2012 &amp;amp;#8211; 2014) and a testing set (2015 -2016) to construct local models on selected pixels over eight PRUDENCE regions. The outputs of the LSTM networks showed good agreement with the simulation results in locations with a shallow wtd (~3m). It is important to note, the quality of the models was strongly affected by the amount of snow cover. Moreover, with the introduction of monthly evapotranspiration anomalies as additional input, pronounced improvements of the network performances were only obtained in more arid regions (i.e., Iberian Peninsula and Mediterranean). Our results demonstrate the potential of LSTM networks to produce high-quality wtd anomalies from hydrometeorological variables that are monitored at the large scale and part of operational forecasting systems potentially facilitating the implementation of an efficient groundwater monitoring system over Europe.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Reference:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Furusho-Percot, C., Goergen, K., Hartick, C., Kulkarni, K., Keune, J. and Kollet, S.

In the current study, the prediction capability of three machine learning models, least square support vector regression (LSSVR), fuzzy genetic (FG) and M5 model tree (M5Tree), in modeling daily and monthly runoffs of Hunza River catchment (HRC) using own and nearby Gilgit climatic station data is examined. The prediction performances of three machine learning models are compared using three statistical indexes, namely, root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE) and coefficient of determination (R&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;). Firstly, four previous time lagged values of runoff, rainfall and atmospheric temperature are used as inputs on basis of correlation analysis to validate and test the accuracy of three machine learning models. After analyzing the performance of various input combinations, optimal one is selected for each variable and then these optimal inputs are employed together to see the forecasting performance. In the first part of study, monthly runoff of HRC are predicted using inputs consisting of local previous monthly runoff values and monthly meteorological values of Gilgit station. The test results show that LSSVR provides more accurate prediction results than the other two machine learning models. In the second part, daily runoffs of HRC are predicted using own previous daily runoff and Gilgit station&amp;amp;#8217;s climatic values. In the test results, a better accuracy is obtained from LSSVR models in relative to the FG and M5Tree models. In the last part of study, daily runoffs of HRC are predicted using own runoff and climatic data of HRC. In the results, it is found that local climatic data slightly improved the all model&amp;amp;#8217;s prediction accuracy in comparison of other scenario which also uses nearby station&amp;amp;#8217;s climatic data. The LSSVR models again are found to be better than the FGA and M5Tree models. LSSVM generally performs superior to the FGA and M5Tree in forecasting daily stream flow of Hunza River using local stream flow and climatic inputs. Based on the results of study, LSSVR model is recommended for monthly and daily runoff prediction of HRC with or without local climatic data.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu2020-2879,"",,

Furthermore, its spatiotemporal variations can affect the development and persistence of extreme weather events. Consequently, soil moisture information is required for a wide range of research and applications, such as agricultural monitoring, flood and drought prediction, climate projection, and carbon-cycle modeling. Despite its scientific and societal importance, observations of soil moisture are sparse, in particular across time and at large spatial scales. Only models and satellite retrievals can provide global soil moisture information. While the ability of land surface models to represent the complex land-atmosphere interplay is still limited, satellite-based soil moisture data are a valuable alternative. However, these products suffer from a scaling based on models, and can only capture the top few centimeters of the soil.&amp;amp;#160;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In this study, we aim to augment satellite-based soil moisture data using machine learning. For this purpose we integrate satellite soil moisture with multiple hydro-meteorological data streams to derive global gridded soil moisture using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. These networks are trained using in-situ soil moisture measurements as target data. With the resulting self-learned relationships, the LSTMs can produce in-situ-like soil moisture globally. We further analyze the implications of using point-scale target data to infer large scale information. The new dataset is derived separately for the surface and the deeper soil, thereby extending beyond the range covered by the satellite-based products. The integration of many data streams and multiple soil moisture observations through a powerful synergistic technique offers the potential to yield high accuracy. This is tested through rigorous cross-validation of the derived dataset. Finally, the planned datasets will permit consistent long-term, large-scale analysis to enhance our understanding of the hydrology-biosphere-climate interplay, to better constrain models and to support hydrological hazards monitoring and climate projections.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu2020-7428,"",,

By enriching the basic information system traditionally used to design reservoir operating policies (i.e., time index and reservoir storage) with additional inputs regarding future water availability, operators can better anticipate and prepare for the onset of extreme hydrologic conditions (wet or dry years). Numerous candidate hydro-meteorological variables and forecasts may potentially be included in the operation design, however, and the best input set for a given problem is not always evident a priori.

The selected policy search routine is the Neuro-Evolutionary Multi-Objective Direct Policy Search (NEMODPS) which generates flexible policy shapes adaptive to changes in the policy input set. This approach is demonstrated for the lower Omo River basin, in southern Ethiopia, where regulation of the recently constructed Gibe III megadam must strike a balance between hydroelectricity generation, large scale irrigation, and ecosystem services downstream.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;We develop a dataset of candidate policy inputs comprising streamflow and precipitation forecasts at multiple spatial and temporal scales, from days to months ahead. Long term (season-ahead) forecasts are conditioned on well-recognized climatic oscillations in the region. Specifically, Artificial Intelligence tools are used to detect relevant anomalies in gridded global climatic datasets of sea-surface temperature, sea-level pressure and geopotential height, which are used as predictors for a multi-variate non-linear forecast model.&amp;amp;#160; Moreover, we analyze how varying objectives &amp;amp;#8211; and tradeoffs therein &amp;amp;#8211; benefit from different information.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Results suggest that informing water system operations with appropriate information can reduce conflicts between water uses, especially in extreme years when a basic policy is particularly inefficient.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu2020-7155,"",,

Induced by the ongoing climate change, it seems to be quite likely that the growing conditions of Norway spruce (Picea abies L.) will deteriorate considerably due to predicted rising temperatures and increasing frequency and intensity of droughts and further extreme weather events. In contrast, the spruce bark beetle is favored by the same trends. As a result, it tends to mass outbreaks and can thereby also infest healthy spruces, causing forests to die off over large areas. Since management resources and warning tools needed for a just-in-time detection of infested trees will remain limited, efficient operational systems are highly desired to enhance and to facilitate bark beetle risk management.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;For this reason, we developed the prototype of an operational early warning system to assess the current risk of potentially endangered spruce stands to bark beetle infestations at a high temporal (daily) and spatial (&amp;amp;#8804; 250-m-grid) resolution.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The system considers the following input layers:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;(a) a quasi-static base-risk layer that is calculated from stand and site characteristics;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;(b) an annually updated layer determining the bark beetle population density; and&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;daily-updated layers for increased host tree susceptibility by (c.1) drought stress or (c.2) storm damage and (c.3) the swarming activity of the bark beetle.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;From these inputs a daily overall infestation risk plus a 7-day-forcast is calculated and made available online to forest owners and managers in the form of a risk map providing different risk levels (e.g., low &amp;amp;#8211; medium &amp;amp;#8211; high).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As one of the main driving factors, the (c.1) drought stress induced disposition of spruce forests to bark beetle infestation is assessed by applying a grid-based soil water balance model at daily resolution. The plausibility of the model is checked via representative soil hydrological measuring areas in the three German project areas Black Forest National Park, Saxon Switzerland National Park, and Hunsr&amp;amp;#252;ck-Hochwald National Park. At the same time, suitable water scarcity indicators are identified and defined for these threshold values, below or above which an increased susceptibility of spruce trees to bark beetle attack is to be expected. Hence, in connection with daily updated weather forecasts, the water-related disposition of spruce stands to bark beetle infestation can be predicted with reasonable accuracy.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The developed early warning system or implemented sub-systems have the flexibility to be adapted to other bark beetles or further forest pests and can be applied at local, regional and national scales.

rayyan-224219067,Monitoring of levee breaching through remote sensing and artificial intelligence,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The study of flooding events resulting from bank over-flooding and levee breaching is of large interest for both society and environment, because flood waves, resulting from levee failure, might cause loss of lives and destruction of properties and ecosystems. Understanding the subsoil mechanics and the fluid-solid interplay allows the stability condition estimate of dams, embankments and slopes and the development of early warning alarm systems. Changes in soil and hydraulic parameters are usually monitored by geotechnical and geophysical investigations that also provide the basic assumptions for developing hydraulic models. Nowadays, remote sensing approaches, including satellite techniques, are mainly used for flooding simulation studies. Indeed, remote sensing observations, such as discharge, flood area extent and water stage, have been used for retrieving flood hydrology information and modeling, calibrating and validating hydrodynamic models, improving model structures and developing data assimilation models. Although all these studies have contributed significantly to the recent advances, uncertainty in observations, as well as in model parameters and prediction, represents a critical aspect for using remote sensing data in the flooding defence. Compared to past and current methods for monitoring the fluvial levee failure, we propose a new procedure that provides a wide and fast alert system. The proposed methodological path is based on presumed relationships between ground level deformation and hydrological and surface soil properties, due to physical mechanisms and exhibited by geodetic and hydrological time series. The procedure is accomplished first through multi-methodological comparative analyses applied to geodetic, hydrological and soil-properties patterns, then through the mapping of the river zones prone to failure. Since the input consists of time series satellite-derived data, the geospatial Artificial Intelligence is applied for extracting knowledge from spatial big data and for increasing the performance of data computing. In particular, machine learning is initially developed for selecting the relevant geographical areas (i.e. rivers, levees and riverbanks) from large geo-referential datasets. Then, since the spatial-distributed points are also time-dependent, the trends of different datasets are compared point by point by selected analytical techniques. Finally, in accordance with the acquired knowledge from previous steps, the system extracts information on the correlation indexes in order to make sense of patterns in space and time and to identify hierarchic orders for the realization of hazard maps. The proposed method is &amp;amp;#8220;wide&amp;amp;#8221; because, unlike other direct surveys, it is able to monitor large spatial areas since it is based on satellite-derived data. It is also &amp;amp;#8220;fast&amp;amp;#8221; because it is based on the Earth&amp;amp;#8217;s surface observation and is not connected with Earth&amp;amp;#8217;s inland investigations (such as the geotechnical and geophysical ones) or with forecasting models (e.g. hydraulic and flooding simulations). Due to these peculiarities, the method can support flood protection studies and can be used for driving the localization of river portions prone to failure, where focusing detailed geotechnical and geophysical surveys.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu2020-3324,"",,
rayyan-224219074,"Understanding headwater baseflow contributions to the overall water supply of the Kathmandu Valley, Nepal",,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"The Kathmandu Valley in Nepal is facing the combined effects of population growth, rapid urbanization, economic development, and climate change. This results in serious water management challenges: growing freshwater demands, declining water tables, drying of streams, and deteriorating water quality. Insufficient surface water supplies have led to increased reliance on groundwater, especially during the dry winter and pre-monsoon seasons (November - May). Despite groundwater’s importance, it is sparsely measured, poorly understood, and insufficiently managed. As it is difficult and costly to measure all groundwater extractions in the Valley, a water balance approach is an alternative method to estimate total net groundwater pumping. Therefore, the aim of this research was to develop and evaluate potential methods for quantifying total pre-monsoon baseflow supplies by extrapolating baseflow measurements of a subsample of watersheds to unmeasured watersheds. Estimated baseflow was used, together with other water balance fluxes and changes in storage, to evaluate net groundwater pumping in the Valley. Three different methods were used: (1) Spatial Analysis, (2) Regression Model, and (3) Black Box (machine learning). All methods relied on streamflow data from 2017 to 2019, collected by citizen scientists from S4W-Nepal. Based on the three methods we presented, we cautiously conclude that it is possible to determine the pre-monsoon baseflow contributions from a sub-sample of head water catchments. Total baseflow estimates for the Valley using Spatial Analysis, Regression Model, Black Box were 2.32, 2.30, 2.65 m3/s respectively. These values show orders of magnitude that correspond with expected values. By using the average baseflow values of all three methods, we were able to close the water balance and make an assumption for the net groundwater pumping in the Valley. Based on a population of 3.5 million, a net groundwater extraction of 96 L/person/day during pre-monsoon was found. This striking outcome emphasizes the need for more discharge and groundwater extraction measurements, to decrease the uncertainties and to refine the methods.","",,"",,

Google&amp;amp;#8217;s Flood Forecasting Initiative aims at providing high-resolution flood forecasts and timely warnings around the globe, while focusing first on developing countries where most of the fatalities occur. The high level structure of Google&amp;amp;#8217;s flood forecasting framework follows the natural hydrologic-hydraulic coupling, where the hydrologic modeling predicts discharge (or other proxies for discharge) based on rainfall-runoff relationships, and the hydraulic model produces high resolution inundation maps based on those discharge predictions.&amp;amp;#160; Within this general partition, both the hydraulic and hydrologic modules benefit by the use of advanced machine learning techniques allowing for precision and global scale.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Classical conceptual hydrologic models such as the Sacramento Soil Moisture Accounting Model explicitly model the dynamics of water volumes based on explicit measurements and estimates of the variables (parameters) involved. These models are, however, inherently challenged by the lack of accurate estimates of model parameters and by inaccurate/incomplete description of the complex non-linear rules that govern the underlying dynamics. In contrast, machine learning models, driven by data alone, are potentially capable of describing complex functional dynamics without explicit modelling.&amp;amp;#160; Both the hydrologic and hydraulic models employed by Google rely on data-driven machine learning technologies to achieve superior and scalable performance. In this presentation we focus on describing one of the deep neural hydrologic models proposed by Google.&amp;amp;#160;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As was already shown in a recent work by Kratzert et al. (2018, 2019)[1], a deep neural model can achieve high performance hydrologic forecasts using deep recurrent models such as long short-term memory networks (LSTMs). Moreover, it was shown by Shalev et al. (2019)[2] that a single globally shared LSTM can achieve state-of-the-art performance by utilizing a data-driven learned embedding without the need for geographical-specific attributes.&amp;amp;#160; While the need for explicit rules in pure conceptual modeling is likely to impede the creation of scalable and accurate hydrologic models, an agnostic approach that ignores reliable and available physical properties of water networks is also likely to be sub-optimal. HydroNet is one of Google&amp;amp;#8217;s hydrologic models that leverages the known water network structure as well as deep neural technology to create a scalable and reliable hydrologic model. HydroNet builds a globally shared model together with regional adaptation sub-models at each site by utilizing the tree structure of river flow network, and is shown to achieve state-of-the-art scalable hydrologic modeling in several large basins in India and the USA.&amp;amp;#160;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#160;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;[1] Kratzert, Frederik, Daniel Klotz, Guy Shalev, G&amp;amp;#252;nter Klambauer, Sepp Hochreiter, and Grey Nearing. &amp;quot;Benchmarking a catchment-aware Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) for large-scale hydrological modeling.&amp;quot; arXiv preprint arXiv:1907.08456 (2019).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;[2] Shalev, Guy, Ran El-Yaniv, Daniel Klotz, Frederik Kratzert, Asher Metzger, and Sella Nevo. &amp;quot;Accurate Hydrologic Modeling Using Less Information.&amp;quot; arXiv preprint arXiv:1911.09427 (2019).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu2020-4134,"",,
rayyan-224219189,The role of wastewater treatment and water reclamation on antibiotic resistance in water and soil environments in the United States and Mexico,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Author(s): Whitener, Victoria Ann | Advisor(s): Jay, Jennifer | Abstract: While improvements in medical management of antibiotics has resulted in decreased of some antibiotic resistant infections and associated deaths in past years, some other antibiotic resistant infection rates are increasing. In order to slow the rate of spread of antibiotic resistant threats, scientists are now looking at the environment as a source and means of transport of resistance. Antibiotic resistant bacteria or genes are quantified in three different environmental compartments in this dissertation – water, animals, and soil. The effect of biological treatment in conventional municipal wastewater treatment plants on antibiotic resistance gene (ARG) levels is crucial to an understanding of environmental antibiotic resistance (AR). This is the first study to compare ARG abundances through two full-scale biological treatment processes in parallel, and one of few to address trickling filters (TFs). In this work, we studied the comparative effects of TFs and activated sludge (AS) bioreactors on the absolute and relative removal of ARGs. We quantified eight target genes via qPCR: tetA, tetW, sul1, sul2, blaSHV, vanA, intI1, and the 16S rRNA gene in the primary effluent (PE) (common to both treatment trains), TF effluent, and AS effluent. We evaluated the similarity of ARG removal to COD and TSS removals as potential indicators, but found that ARGs are more readily removed by TF or AS treatment than either COD or TSS. Absolute ARG abundances decreased by up to 1.7 and 2.8 logs after TF and AS treatments, respectively, and the difference between the two treatments’ removal rates ranged as high as 2.8. The changes in relative abundances of tetA and tetW decreased respectively up to 5.6�10−3 and 9.7�10−3 gene copies per 16S rRNA. Potential for conjugative HGT was evaluated via the linear association between ARG and intI1 relative abundances. The relative abundance of sul1 positively correlated (r ≥ 0.74, p ≤ 4.0�10−4) to intI1 in all sampling points, while sul2 did not (p g 0.05), corresponding to what is known about plasmid location. These findings are particularly relevant where secondary effluent is the final effluent to the environment. Our results show that while absolute abundances of all target genes decreased in secondary treatment, TF and AS bioreactors affect ARGs differently. The use of antibiotics for therapeutic and especially non-therapeutic purposes in livestock farms promotes the development of antibiotic resistance in previously susceptible bacteria through selective pressure. In this work, we examined E. coli isolates using the standard Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion susceptibility protocol and the CLSI standards. Companies selling retail chicken products in Los Angeles, California were grouped into three production groupings – Conventional, No Antibiotics, and Humane Family Owned. Humane Family Owned is not a federally regulated category in the United States, but shows the reader that the chicken is incubated, hatched, raised, slaughtered, and packaged by one party, ensuring that the use of antibiotics in the entire production of the chicken is known and understood. We then examined the antibiotic resistance of the E. coli isolates (n = 325) by exposing them to seven common antibiotics, and resistance was seen to two of the antibiotics, ampicillin and erythromycin. As has been shown previously, it was found that for both ampicillin and erythromycin, there was no significant difference (p g 0.05) between Conventional and USDA (United States Department of Agriculture)-certified No Antibiotics chicken. Unique to this work, we additionally found that Humane Family Owned chicken had fewer (p ≤ 0.05) antibiotic-resistant E. coli isolates than both of the previous. Although not considered directly clinically relevant, we chose to test erythromycin because of its ecological significance to the environmental antibiotic resistome, which is not generally done. To our knowledge, Humane Family Owned consumer chicken has not previously been studied for its antibiotic resistance. This work contributes to a better understanding of a potential strategy of chicken production for the overall benefit of human health, giving evidentiary support to the One Health approach implemented by the World Health Organization. While increased use of reclaimed water is a solution to water-scarce regions, it is necessary to carefully consider the long-term effects of applying reclaimed water to agricultural soil. In the Maneadero Valley, Mexico, tertiary effluent from El Naranjo Wastewater Treatment Plant is used for the irrigation of flowers and livestock crops. In the past, groundwater was used, but over extraction of the Maneadero aquifer resulted in severe seawater intrusion to the region. In this work, we evaluate antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) through qPCR as well as the viability method, PMA-qPCR (propidium monoazide). Genes were evaluated in the reclaimed water and at different farms where reclaimed water has been used for either 6, 4, 2, 0 (never) years. The investigation aims to better understand any potential public health impact of the 1) the use of the reclaimed water, 2) the effect of the distribution system, and 3) the effect of reclaimed water holding tanks. Additionally, the effect that the use of reclaimed water has on the soil environment with increasing times is evaluated. Because the use of the reclaimed water is a solution to the water scarcity of the area, we use the PMA-qPCR assay to better characterize any public health effect that the ARGs could create. While it is widely acknowledged that shifts in diet could play a large role in mitigating climate change with important health co-benefits, knowledge on how to accomplish these shifts is lacking. Our previous study showed a statistically significant reduction in the dietary carbon footprint of students who had completed a college course on the connections between food and the environment compared to a control group enrolled in an unrelated course. An extension of the previous study, this research evaluates the sustainability of female and male diets in both the intervention and control groups from baseline to follow up with respect to the following planetary boundaries: greenhouse gases, land use, water use, nitrogen loss, and phosphorus use. Student dietary footprints are compared to a per capita limit allowable for food according to the planetary boundaries concept. In addition, a 50-point Healthy Eating Index was calculated at baseline and follow up for all students. Female students enrolled in the intervention course reported diets with statistically significant reductions in their footprints from baseline to follow up for greenhouse gases (p=0.011), land use (p=0.012), and phosphorus (p=0.045), and the female diets were statistically different from the control groups for those three boundaries. For water use, female diets increased in footprint from baseline to follow up due to an increase in vegetable intake. Males enrolled in the intervention showed similar trends (reductions in footprints for greenhouse gases, land use, and phosphorus use and an increase in blue water use), but differences were not statistically significant, partially due to the smaller number of male respondents. For all of the planetary boundaries except blue water use, the student dietary footprints were well above the per capita boundary for food-related sources.","",,"",,

Such properties influence simultaneously the terrestrial water and carbon cycles as they determine the water fluxes in the soil and the soil&amp;amp;#8217;s water holding capacity, ultimately affecting runoff production, groundwater recharge, and the amount and temporal variability of plant available water (i.e. plant water stress). Despite their paramount importance, limited global information concerning the spatial distribution of soil hydraulic properties currently exists. Information at the global scale, commonly used in Earth System Models, mostly originates from pedotransfer functions (PTFs). PFTs are empirical relations that express the dependence of soil hydraulic properties on easily measured attributes as soil properties. Several PFTs currently exist, which adopt different formulations, spanning from simple linear regressions to elaborate machine learning, and are trained with different datasets, yielding different soil hydraulic properties for the same soil texture. &amp;amp;#160;&amp;amp;#160;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The question we ask in this study is: how does uncertainty in the soil hydraulic parameters propagate in global ecosystem responses? To achieve this, we deploy a numerical experiment covering many different ecosystems. The terrestrial ecosystem model T&amp;amp;C is used to model energy, water, and carbon dynamics at 80 locations worldwide, spanning all climatological regimes, major biomes and soil types. Soil hydraulic properties at each site were estimated using six widely used PTFs starting from local soil textural information. Uncertainty propagation from soil hydraulic properties to modelled ecosystem dynamics was evaluated for all sites and its dependence on soil textural properties and local topography was quantified.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Our results highlight that uncertainty propagation from hydraulic properties to ecosystem dynamics is much stronger for hydrological fluxes (e.g. infiltration, groundwater recharge and runoff production) than carbon dynamics (e.g. gross and net primary productivity and leaf area dynamics) or energy fluxes (net radiation, sensible and latent heat). Uncertainty in hydrological fluxes can be up to 400% using different PTFs, whereas uncertainties in carbon and energy fluxes are typically less than 20%. The largest uncertainties were observed for slow draining soils, containing large fractions of clay, located in regions with intermediate values of wetness (i.e. annual precipitation &amp;amp;#8776; annual potential evapotranspiration).

rayyan-224219234,Including hydrologic signatures in the calibration of a groundwater-surface water model to improve representation of artificial drain,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;About half of the Danish agricultural land is artificially drained to make land arable and increase crop yield. Those artificial drains, mostly in the form on tile drains, have a significant effect on the groundwater flow patterns and the whole water cycle. Consequently, the drainage system must also be represented in hydrological models that are used to understand and simulate, for example, recharge patterns, groundwater flow paths, or the transport and retention of nutrients. However, representation of drain in regional- and large-scale hydrological models is challenging due to i) issues with scale, ii) a lack of data on the distribution of the drain network, and iii) a lack of direct observations of drain flow. This calls for more indirect methods to inform such models.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We assume that drain flow leaves a signal in certain hydrograph signatures, as it impacts the generation of streamflow. Based on a dataset of observed discharge covering all of Denmark, and simulation results from regional-scale hydrological models, we use machine learning regressors to shed light on possible correlations between hydrograph signatures and artificial drainage. Building up on this step, we run a series of calibration exercises on a hydrological model of the agriculturally dominated Norsminde catchment, Denmark (~100&amp;amp;#160;km&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;). The model is set up in the DHI MIKE SHE software, as distributed coupled groundwater-surface water models with a grid size of 100&amp;amp;#160;m. The different calibration exercises differed in the objective functions used: either we only use conventional stream flow metrics (KGE), or also include hydrograph signatures that showed sensitive towards drain flow in our regression analysis. We then evaluate the results from the different calibration exercises, in terms of how well the model reproduces directly observed drain flow, and spatial drainage patterns.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Despite including hydrologic signatures in the calibration process, the representation of drain flow in large-scale models remains challenging. Eventually, the insight gained from this and similar studies will be incorporated in the National Water Resources Model for Denmark, to help improving national targeted regulation of nitrate application through fertilizers.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu2020-9283,"",,
rayyan-224219362,Hybridizing Machine Learning and Physically-based Earth System Models to Improve Prediction of Multivariate Extreme Events (AI Exploration of Wildland Fire Prediction),,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Focal Areas: This project responds to two focal areas identified in the DOE Call for AI4ESP White Papers: 1) Predictive modeling through the use of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, and 2) insights gleaned from complex data using explainable AI and big data analytics. Science Challenge: Large wildland fires (hereafter wildfires) appearing as high-impact compound climate extreme events are closely related to hydroclimate and water cycle extremes that modulate surface fuel supply and combustibility. These compound events have multivariate climatic features (e.g., temperature, precipitation, relative humidity, wind, lightning) and societal drivers (e.g., forest management, land use change, human caused ignitions). Meanwhile, they induce strong feedbacks to the coupled atmosphere, biosphere, and hydrosphere by perturbing regional and global radiation budget as well as ecological, biogeochemical, and water cycles across multiple spatiotemporal scales. The nonlinear interactions between these natural and anthropogenic components of the Earth system are too complex to be completely and adequately represented in today’s Earth system models (ESMs). The inherent stochastic nature of fire activity at all scales further increases the difficulty of its prediction using ESMs that are usually developed from deterministic equations and parameterizations. Besides, concurrence of long-term (decadal to interdecadal) global climate change and fire regime shifts overlapping with short-term (intraseasonal to interannual) variations of regional fire weather and burning activity confound predictability of these compound extreme events. We propose to address the above scientific challenges by using machine learning (ML)-based data-driven modeling techniques to integrate observations and physically-based ESMs’ simulations in a computationally efficient hybrid prediction system. This prediction system is supposed to characterize the wildfire’s sensitivity to climate and exogenous drivers at high resolution (~ 0.25°) on subseasonal to seasonal (S2S) timescales providing improved predictability and explainability. We will use the system to help identify: (1) What are the computational elements of a hybrid system needed to predict compound climate extreme events such as global wildfires? (2) What are the key drivers (either natural or anthropogenic) that modulate short-term variations of multivariate fire weather and burning activity over different regions? How can one take advantage of those driver-response relationships to improve the predictability of large wildfires on S2S time scales? (3) What are the underlying physical mechanisms and sources of improved predictability? Which ML techniques are optimal in revealing and adapting these mechanisms?","",https://doi.org/10.2172/1769718,"",,
rayyan-224219409,Deforestation Prediction using Ensemble of Convolutional Neural Network Models,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Deforestation is the destruction of forest due to for a non-forest purpose [1]. The disadvantages due to deforestation are an increased amount of carbon dioxide emissions and soil erosion. Increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere increases temperature of the earth, leading to climate change. Also the destruction of forest habitat and the loss of biological diversity of both plants and animals occurs. With increased deforestation earth will lose its top fertile soil layer and get converted into desert. The ecological balance will get disturbed and floods and drought will become more frequent. Wildlife will also be affected. As of now there only one habitable planet, and we need to conserve all life and environment. The surface area of earth is around 510.1 million km2. In this about 29.2% is earths land area. And in that land area only around 30% is the Forest area [2]. There are several studies taken to monitor the deforestation happening in all over the world as well as India. One of the notable ones is which gives the data of loss of 28% forest covers over eight decades. The major deforestation has occurred due to conversion of forests to agricultural lands, timber product, construction of major projects such as reservoirs in dams, road construction etc. Several global, legally binding instruments (LBIs) have instituted requirements for national-level inventory and reporting (UNFF 2004c:7). The recently effective Kyoto Protocol requires the inventorying of land use-related deforestation, afforestation, and reforestation in developed country Parties. For afforestation to occur, it requires more active coordination to support, the environmental objectives of global conventions, such as the conservations on biodiversity and wetland protection [3].
There are many management challenges associated with global forest health. Conversion of forest land to commercial usage, constructions, etc. will not only decrease the forest health but also leads to extinction of many biodiversity’s. In terms of accounting systems for forest yields, global accounts of forest production are based on national reports and contain substantial gaps, particularly in respect to non-timber resources. So, there is no accurate measurement or number to count the number of trees lost. First step in addressing forest deforestation is to monitor and report changes in forest cover in areas that are reserved for forest in the country [4]. Manual labour checking of the land area is time consuming and never ending. In order to overcome this challenge high resolution satellite imaging are utilized. Once again, the manual labour is recurring and tiresome [5].  Use of machine learning methods has emerged in recent days to predict accurately how much of the land has undergone deforestation over the years. utilizing mathematical models and training the systems will result in automatic detection and less human labour for detecting the large amount of satellite data [6]. 
Tarazona, Yonatan, et al focuses on mapping tropical deforestation using time series and machine learning algorithms and were able to classify forest, cropland, bare soil, and water with more than 90% accuracy [7].  Large areas under deforestation and degradation threat, and location of suitable areas for regeneration were predicted by Grinand, Clovis, et al. through machine learning algorithms combined with high-resolution data sets to provide simultaneous and spatial forecasts of deforestation, land degradation, and regeneration for the next two decades [8]. Bavaghar et al. utilised logistic regression on satellite imagery data to estimate the location and extent of deforestation which achieved 75% accuracy [9]. Hyandye et al. used multinomial logistic regression to determine how land use/land cover class in Tanzania was influenced by a set of variables. The authors used the multinomial model, run on Landsat of data across multiple years, to obtain the probable change in land use/land cover.[10]. Szuste et al. [11] used Support Vector Machines for land use and land cover classification in tropical coastal zones achieved decent results.
Kavzoglu and Mather [12] used artificial neural networks to identify land use/land cover for remote sensing data in England, and provide a set of guidelines for practitioners for designing and using artificial neural networks in remote sensing image classification. Some examples of classification using neural networks for remote sensing data are provided by Srivastava et al. [14], Shao and Lunetta [13], and Wang et al. [15]. Kong et al.  [16] apply a long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network to predict forest fire based on a time series of Modis satellite images. They have used a composite time series instead of a single-pixel time series and examined changes to detect fire events. Convolutional neural networks have been successfully applied on multimedia approaches and used to create a system able to handle the classification without any human’s interactions. In [17], for satellite image classification that are based on deep learning convolutional neural network for features extraction used AlexNet, VGG19, GoogLeNet and Resnet50 pretraining models.  Akshay, S., et al, proposed a system for satellite image processing that detects unused land. Here remote sensing earth images are taken as the dataset where the pre-processing step includes converting image into greyscale image, compression and noise removal. Segmentation is done to partition the region of used and unused lands. Random forest is used to segregate two landscapes as used and unused land which gives accuracy better than the existing systems [18]. In the work for recognition in high-resolution, multi-spectral satellite imagery, Pritt, Mark, and Gary Chern [19] have described a deep learning system for classifying objects and facilities from the IARPA Functional Map of the World (fMoW) dataset into 63 different classes. The system consists of an ensemble of convolutional neural networks and additional neural networks that integrate satellite metadata with image features.
The proposed work addresses the detection of the forest cover areas as an important and holistic studies related to ongoing forest cover changes. The outline of the proposed work is shown in Fig.1 It consists of following steps. Preparing Input images acquired from the datasets. In this step the image is acquired, Pre-processed and augmented. Defined two classes for prediction, i.e. 0 is for “No Deforestation happened” and 1 is for “Deforestation”. Labelled the images accordingly and passed it to the pre-trained models for training the models. Pre-trained weights help to overcome the overfitting of the model with a smaller number of datasets. Feature extraction and classification using AlexNet, ResNet18 and DenseNet121 was done individually and all the results were ensembled. We have used Sentinel-2 datasets that is publicly available in Kaggle. 500 original images were used and four different data augmentation techniques were applied to generate more images. A total of 2500 images were utilized to train the models. Data was split into 80% training datasets and 20% validation datasets. 200 separate test sets were taken to verify the test accuracies.
In this proposed approach, all models used Adam optimizer with decreasing learning rate after every 10 epochs. All the graphs were plotted in TensorBoard. The training accuracies are shown in Fig2(a) and losses are shown in Fig 2(b).
After analysing the obtaining of the predictions of all three models, we combined the results of 3 models: AlexNet, ResNet18 and DenseNet121, and predicted the class which was most frequently predicted by all the models. This combined by the proposed Grid searched weighted average ensemble model gave the remarkable best performance and achieved a test accuracy of 90.12% and sensitivity of 95.06%.

rayyan-224219620,Bias‐corrections on aridity index simulations of climate models by observational constraints,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract Aridity Index (AI) indicates the balance between water supply and water demand on the atmosphere–land interface. Despite continuous improvements, coupled climate models still have significant systematic errors in simulating AI in terms of temporal and spatial variabilities. One of the approaches to bias‐correct simulations is extracting the linear relationship between historical observations and model outputs by utilizing the empirical orthogonal function (EOF). In this study, the methodology of ensemble EOF‐based bias‐correction by observational constraints is developed based on previous bias‐correction approach, with the improvement on seeking the optimal combinations of the leading modes with sensitivity test and replacing the certain correction with the ensemble means of optimal members. In verification, the ensemble mean of Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5‐EM) is bias‐corrected towards the CPC/GLDAS observations, and the extracted leading modes present high correlations with internal climate variability. By cross‐validation and posteriori independent validation of hindcasts over the historical period (1948–2005), the ensemble EOF‐based bias‐correction could better present spatial patterns compared to the CMIP5‐EM after systematic bias‐correction, as indicated by the anomaly correlation and the root mean square error. The verifications also indicate that the temporal variability in aridity over different dryland regions is much closer to that in the observations and that the dryland subtype changes are improved significantly by bias‐corrections. Besides, another observational dataset of UDel/CRU is applied to assess the uncertainty on different datasets and the improvement on skill scores is robust. The above results verify that the ensemble EOF‐based bias‐corrections provide better reference for assessing and projecting global aridity changes by climate models.","",https://doi.org/10.1002/joc.7279,"",,
rayyan-224219684,Global soil mapping with Neural Networks&amp;#160;,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;High quality global soil maps are crucial to face several challenges such as reducing soil erosion, climate change adaptation and mitigation, ensuring food and water security, and biodiversity conservation planning. To obtain accurate and robust soil properties maps, research and development are necessary to identify the most appropriate prediction models and to develop efficient and robust workflows. A few recent studies used Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) in Digital Soil Mapping, in some cases improving the accuracy of the predicted maps compared to other methods like Random Forest (RF). In this study we tested different ANN architectures on a global top-soil dataset of ca. 110 000 samples, comparing the results for the different architectures with the more traditional approach of RF. The target variables considered are pH, Soil Organic Carbon, Sand, Silt, and Clay. We selected 40 environmental covariates from a pool of over 400 to represent the most important soil forming factors. We tried simpler architectures (single input &amp;amp;#8211; single target) using point observations for one target variable with corresponding raster cell values for spatially explicit environmental covariates. We also used more complex architectures (multi input - multi target) incorporating contextual information surrounding an observation (convolutional) and with multiple target variables. Preliminary results show that increasing the number of hidden layers in the neural network does not significantly influence the results, while changing the type of architecture can play a bigger role in the overall accuracy of the model. The overall prediction accuracy of the ANN was comparable with the RF model. We conclude that ANN are a promising, relatively new, approach for Global Digital Soil Mapping and that further research is needed to improve performance.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu21-15379,"",,
rayyan-224219731,"Partitioning of daily evapotranspiration using a modified shuttleworthwallace model, random Forest and support vector regression, for a cabbage farmland",,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Prediction of vegetation transpiration (T) is of increasing importance in water resources management and agricultural practices, in particular to facilitate precision irrigation. Traditional evapotranspiration (ET) partitioning dual source modeling requires an extensive array of ground-level parameters and needs model correction and calibration to attain model certainty. In response, a quick and low-cost method is described to predict T using artificial intelligence (AI) modeling based on meteorological factors, status of crop growth factors and soil parameters. This study compares Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Regression (SVR) in building AI models using three years (2014&amp;amp;#8211;2017) of continuous high-resolution monitoring data in a cabbage farmland.Input data included air temperature (Ta), solar radiation (Ra), relative humidity (RH), vapor pressure deficit(VPD), wind speed (Ws), soil moisture (SM), vegetation height (H), and leaf area index (LAI). The results show that soil surface resistance calculations by Monte Carlo iterative method and vegetation stomatal resistance calculations and carbon dioxide concentration and emission, improve performance of the original Shuttleworth&amp;amp;#8211;Wallace(S-W) model. In addition, the AI model indicates Ta and Ra are essential inputs for both model types. When there are sufficient observation data, or only lacking soil and vegetation data, the RF model is recommended for use. When there are only limited data or lack of critical Ta and Ra data, the SVR model is the preferred model. Scientific guidance is provided for agriculture precision irrigation, indicating which AI model can best estimate T and water demand for irrigation planning and water management.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu21-4024,"",,

rayyan-224219912,"Short-term hydrological drought forecasting in the Paute river basin, Ecuadorian Andes",,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Hydrological droughts can trigger socioeconomic disruptions which can cause large impacts on societies. Therefore, their forecast is extremely important for early warning and disaster mitigation. Several modelling approaches have been developed for this purpose, and models based on machine learning have become popular during the last decades. In this study, we evaluated the performance of five commonly used models in drought forecasting: Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), multiple linear (MLM), Random Forest (RF), K-nearest Neighbours (KN) and Artificial Networks (ANN) models.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;The study site was the Paute River basin (4816.56 km2) located in the mid-high and eastern part of the Ecuadorian Andes. The &amp;quot;Daniel Palacios&amp;quot; dam, the oldest of 4 strategic dams and which alone generates 35% of Ecuador's national energy demand, was considered the lowest point in the basin. The basin is susceptible to hydrological droughts, which have led to power shortages in the past (e.g., in 1995, 1999 and 2009).&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;As hydrological drought predictand we used the monthly Standardized Streamflow Index (SSI) accumulated at 1-, 3-, 6- and 12-months, while the predictor variables were precipitation, temperature, river flow and the climatic indices associated with the El Ni&amp;amp;#241;o-Southern Oscillation, ENSO (El Ni&amp;amp;#241;o 1+2, El Ni&amp;amp;#241;o 3, El Ni&amp;amp;#241;o 4, and El Ni&amp;amp;#241;o 3.4, which are strongly related to droughts in Ecuador). Data were obtained from the National Institute of Meteorology and Hydrology (INAMHI) and the Climate Prediction Centre of NOAA.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;The models were evaluated for lead times of 1, 3, 6 and 12 months through the determination coefficient (R2), the Nash-Sutcliff efficiency (NSE) and the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). The models' capability to distinguish between occurrence and non-occurrence of droughts (here defined as SSI&amp;amp;#8804;-1) was assessed with a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) diagram. Models were validated using the expanding window (walk forward approach) as a back testing strategy starting as calibration and validation periods Aug/1984-Dec/2010 and Jan/2011-Dec/2019 (75 and 25% of the data, respectively).&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;As expected, SSI at longer aggregations can be predicted more accurately than at shorter ones with all models. This fact is explained because the former ones more effectively reduce the noise than the latter due to the increase in filter length. The greater the lead time, the less reliable the prediction. Considering a lead time of 1 month, the best model was the ANN for SSI-1 and SSI-3 (R2=0.64, ROC=0.67; and R2=0.78, ROC=1.00 respectively), and the MLM model for SSI-6 and SSI-12 (R2=0.86, ROC=0.66, and R2=0.96, ROC=0.99 respectively). However, very similar performances were obtained in the latter cases by the ANN model (R2=0.86, ROC=0.66 R2=0.91 and ROC=0.75 respectively) and the ARIMA model (R2=0.83, ROC=0.98 R2=0.93 and ROC=0.99 respectively). ARIMA models showed large errors for lead times longer than 1 month, so an ANN model is recommended. However, to maximize their potential, further research could explore modifications of the ANN architecture or the input data. Results indicate that these models can be used to forecast hydrological droughts in the Paute river basin and can be used to support reservoir operation decisions.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu21-16318,"",,
rayyan-224219996,Scale matters,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"I know the title of this editorial will come as no surprise to readers of the Journal, but I am constantly reminded of it as I witness changes in my local community. As a geographer, I am always thinking about scale, mostly spatial but also temporal, at which phenomena occur or are analyzed. I also am acutely aware of land use patterns and particularly changes, both large and small, as they occur over time. Recently, I have been watching incremental development take place in a neighborhood through which friends and I sometimes take our early morning walks. One day, we pass a lot covered with trees, located on a corner or sometimes sandwiched between two houses. A few weeks later, the lot is cleared and readied for development, and soon after, a house, garage, and driveway occupy the space. Over the past year or so, this has happened maybe six to eight times, not really rapid development, but definitely creeping development. The loss of green space is disturbing enough, but so too is the impact on flooding. The city is in the coastal plain and is rather flat, but the neighborhood is not in the floodplain. However, when thunderstorms bring intense rains, there is pluvial flooding along the roads, the remnants of which we can often see on lawns where pine needles and leaves show a flood line. And, of course, the increased impermeability puts more stormwater in local streams exacerbating flooding outside the neighborhood. Given my interest in flooding issues, the incremental nature of this lot-by-lot development, with seemingly no adaptation to, or even recognition of the issue, has bothered me. And then, very recently, the scale of development in the same neighborhood expanded such that a 60 plus acre (about 25 hectares) forested area was completed deforested, roadways were identified, and the beginnings of infrastructure placement became obvious, suggesting dozens of houses to be built. Again, this site is not in the floodplain, but all I can think about is the impact this will have on flooding locally and downstream. I should also mention that community leaders are slow to recognize stormwater issues in the community or the contributions of development throughout the watershed to flood risk. As a result, activities to address them are few and far between. As a social scientist who studies flood risk management, I am disappointed by the lack of consideration given by local council members to the increasing problem and an apparent disregard for the impacts of this incremental development on community flood patterns. And, although I am not a modeler, I recognize and appreciate the critical role that modeling at various spatial and temporal scales can play in assisting policy makers to understand the nature and seriousness of the ever-evolving flood risk. This is particularly the case, given the nonstationarity affecting flood risks associated with both climate change and human activities such as those described above. To address these issues, one might go back to three questions suggested by Kaplan and Garrick (1981, p. 13) to assist with quantifying risk: (1) What can happen? (i.e., what can go wrong?) (2) How likely is it that that will happen? and (3) If it does happen, what are the consequences? To that end, out of the many excellent papers in this issue, I focus on several that present modeling approaches at different spatial and temporal scales addressing one or another of the three questions that can help to inform policy makers on the extent and changing nature of risk. Recognizing the need for different management approaches for frequent, smaller floods compared with larger, less frequent floods, Konrad and Restivo (2021) use records for stream gauges throughout the United States to evaluate trends across all quantiles of a flood distribution. Through models using quantile regression, the goal is to evaluate the impact of such factors as reservoirs, land use, and climate change on trends in annual peak streamflows. Such flood frequency trend analyses can help to inform the management of nonstationary flood risk. While this study is at a national scale, Khan, Hussain, Ahmad, and Noor (2021) undertake a regional frequency analysis with a case study in a province in Pakistan that allows for the estimation of quantiles at ungauged or poorly gauged sites. Applying several models, including regional frequency analysis and a neural network and using data on annual maximum peak flows and site characteristics from 36 sites over a 15-year period, they were able to define homogeneous regions and subsequently estimate quantiles at both gauged and ungauged sites. Again, the results of this study have an important implication for flood risk management as well as water resources management. Moving to the river basin scale, He, Chen, Wang, Long, and He (2021) argue that the assumption of stationarity in hydrologic frequency analyses reduces the reliability of design flood results. Applying several models to analyze the current flood design under different nonstationary conditions in the Manas River Basin, they found climate change to be a very important factor leading to abrupt changes in flood distributions. The three papers discussed above address the first two of Kaplan and Garrick's questions by modeling various conditions as they vary over space and time. The papers by Zischg et al. (2021) and Hauer, Flödl, Habersack, and Pulg (2021) address the third question, albeit from very different perspectives. Zischg et al. (2021) address potential impacts to buildings, while Hauer et al. (2021) model impacts of channel modification, both of which have important implications and applications to flood management decision-making. Using a synthetic vulnerability function with targeted heuristics on a sample of representative buildings, Zischg et al. (2021) analyzed a number of flood scenarios in a case study of several floodplains near Bern, Switzerland. Their goal was to test a model that can be used to understand potential flood impacts in data-scarce areas by comparing their results to those from studies using other vulnerability functions. Hauer et al. (2021) model the impacts of an “extraordinary flood” on a channelized river in Norway. They found that channelization of the river increased flood risk by increasing supercritical flow and erosion potential. These results need to be considered in order to avoid implementing quick solutions that can increase overall flood potential. The examples above represent modeling approaches at different scales that foster the testing of various scenarios, whether that is river discharges, precipitation patterns, and/or climate and land use change, among others. And in so doing, they provide a range of outcomes and options for policy and other decision makers, whether the concern is incremental small lot development or regional flood problems. However, I am not so naive as to believe that the excellent work of modelers is readily or even easily translated to policy makers, especially those for whom flood management is only part of their responsibilities. Indeed, Borowski and Hare (2007) address reasons why models developed to support water management are not readily embraced by water managers. Progress has been made since 2007. Interdisciplinary journals like the Journal of Flood Risk Management provide a forum for discussing the disconnect. And it is up to social scientists like me to work in our communities to help city councils and others recognize the impacts of their decisions and to consider scenarios that address dynamic conditions at various spatial and temporal scales, including climate change.","",https://doi.org/10.1111/jfr3.12765,"",,
rayyan-224220012,An automated machine learning based ensemble approach for improving estimates of soil water retention parameters,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Accurately mapping soil water retention parameters is vital for modeling atmosphere-land interactions but is challenged by limited measurements and simulations globally. Ensemble pedotransfer functions (PTFs) have been highly recommended for use due to the higher reliability of ensemble models and the error compensation among ensemble members. However, conventional ensemble approaches assign a fixed weight to each PTF and may not fully utilize the strengths of individual PTFs. In this work, we developed a new ensemble approach based on an automated machine learning workflow to assign varying weights to assemble 13 widely used PTFs. The AutoML-assisted ensemble approach (AutoML-Ens), as well as the simple average (MEAN), Bayesian Model Average (BMA), and the hierarchical multi-model ensemble approach (HMME), were evaluated using the global coverage National Cooperative Soil Surbey (NCSS) Soil Characterization Database. Results indicate that AutoML-Ens approach performs better than the conventional approaches in terms of the coefficient of determination (R&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;) and root mean square error (RMSE).

Next, the LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory network)-RNN (Recurrent Neural Networks) model were used to predict the total dissolved solids (TDS), Sodium adsorption ratio (SAR) rate for the period 2020-2030. The results showed that the long-term monthly rainfall under the RCP8.5 scenario reported a further decrease compared to the RCP4.5 and RCP6, and the rainfall fluctuations were higher than the other two scenarios. Temperature changes in the second period are higher than in the first period, so that in the first period under the scenario of RCP4.5, RCP6 and RCP8.5 showed respectively 1, 1.5 and 2 degrees Celsius increase, while in the second period, 2, 3 and 4 degrees Celsius is predicted. The average discharge shows by 15.8% and 20.97% respectively decrease under the RCP4.5 scenario in the first and second periods, while by 8.51 and 27.55% under the RCP6 scenario and 6.38% and 39.89% under the RCP8.5 scenario compared to the observed discharge.

Then, the data in the warehouse was used to develop a computer tool to predict river water level using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), in particular, Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTM). As the prediction performance is significantly affected by the model inputs, the feature selection step, which considers the multivariate correlation of water quality information in terms of similarity and proximity, is particularly important.

Amid climate change impacts and competing water consumptions from a growing population, there is a need for better management of this scarce resource. Yet, water management is complex. As a resource, water exists under various forms, from water droplets in the atmosphere to embodied water in consumer products. Its flows and existence transcend national and geographic borders; its management, however, are limited by boundaries. To date, machine learning has shown potentials in applications across domains, from showing skills in game plays to improving efficiencies and operation of real-life processes. The system-of-systems perspective has emerged in many fields as an attempt to capture the complexity arising from individual components. Within a system, the interactions and interdependencies across components can produce unintended consequences. Moreover, their effects that are not explainable just from studying a component on its own. Its concept intertwines with Complexity Science, and points to Wicked Problems, solutions of which are difficult to find and achieve. Climate change itself has been recognised as a &amp;amp;#8216;Super Wicked&amp;amp;#8217; problem, for which deadlines are approaching but for which there are no clear solutions. Yet, there is often a lack of understanding of the interactions and dependencies, even from a physical modelling perspective. A comprehensive approach to capturing these interactions is through physical modelling of water processes, such as hydraulics and hydrological modelling. The structure and data pipelines of such an approach, nevertheless, is static and does not evolve unless reconfigured by model experts.&amp;amp;#160;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We propose that a form of machine learning, Deep Reinforcement Learning, can be used to better capture the complex whole system interactions of components in the water cycle and assist in their management. This approach capitalises the rapid advances of Machine Learning in environmental applications and differ to traditional optimisation techniques in that it provides distributed learning, consistent models for components that can evolve to connect and continuously adapt to the operating environment. This is key in capturing the changes brought about by climate change and the subsequent environmental and human change in response.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;1.

Water consumption by urban greenery has a major role in urban water management, particularly in water-scarce regions where green covers are most affected by drought and aridity. More green and blue water resources are required to maintain and expand urban green spaces. Quantifying the water footprint of urban greenery helps to balance greening cities while water saving from both green and blue water resources. We employed remote sensing and artificial intelligence techniques to assess the water consumption and water footprint of a 780&amp;amp;#8208;ha public green space, the Adelaide Parklands in Australia. We estimated the green and blue water footprint of this green space (containing 29 parks) during 2010-2018 on a monthly basis. Our results showed that the mean total water footprint of the Adelaide Parklands was about 7.75 gigaliter per annum over 2010-2018; it varied from 7.19 gigaliter/year in 2018 to 8.45 gigaliter/year in 2012. The blue water footprint was consistently higher than the green water footprint even in wet time of the year. We suggest implementing sponge city and water sensitive urban design (WSUD) techniques to help greening cities while reducing the water footprint of urban green spaces. These approaches have the potential to lessen the pressure on blue water resources and optimise the consumption of green water resources.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu21-100,"",,

However, irrigation and other water management methods are still missing in most global climate models today, despite irrigated agriculture being the dominant land use in parts of Asia. In this study, we test the irrigation scheme available in the land model JULES (Joint UK Land Environment Simulator) by running land-only simulations over South and East Asia driven by WFDEI (WATCH Forcing Data ERA-Interim) forcing data. Irrigation in JULES is applied on a daily basis by replenishing soil moisture in the upper soil layers to field capacity, and we use a version of the irrigation scheme that extracts water for irrigation from groundwater and rivers, which physically limits the amount of irrigation that can be applied. We prescribe irrigation for C3 grasses in order to simulate the effects of agriculture, albeit retaining the simpler, widely used 5-PFT (plant functional type) configuration in JULES. Irrigation generally increases soil moisture and evapotranspiration, which results in increasing latent heat fluxes and decreasing sensible heat fluxes. Comparison with combined observational/machine-learning products for turbulent fluxes shows that while irrigation can reduce biases, other biases in JULES, unrelated to irrigation, are larger than improvements due to the inclusion of irrigation. Irrigation also affects water fluxes within the soil, e.g. runoff and drainage into the groundwater level, as well as soil moisture outside of the irrigation season. We find that the irrigation scheme, at least in the uncoupled land-atmosphere setting, can rapidly deplete groundwater to the point that river flow becomes the main source of irrigation (over the North China Plain and the Indus region) and can have the counterintuitive effect of decreasing annual average soil moisture (over the Ganges plain). Subsequently, we will explore the impact of irrigation on regional climate by conducting coupled land-atmosphere simulations.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu21-12213,"",,

Despite harbouring 18 percentage of the global population, India only accounts for 4 percentage of the world’s water resources. Although India has made improvements over the past decades to both the availability and quality of municipal drinking water systems, its large population has stressed planned water resources and rural areas are left out. India is also a major grain producer with a great need for water to support the commodity. As with all countries with large agricultural output, excess water consumption for food production depletes the overall water table. Also, regardless of improvements to drinking water, many other water sources are contaminated with both bio and chemical pollutants, and over 21 percentage of the country’s diseases are water-related. Other concern is that India may lack overall long term availability of replenishable water resources. India’s water crisis is often the result of a lack of government planning, limited business closure, industrial and human pollution, and government corruption. In addition, India’s water shortage is expected to increase as population growth is expected to rise to 1.6 billion by 2050. Niti Aayog estimates that around 100 Million Indians are expected to run out of water by 2030. To that end, global water scarcity is expected to become a leading cause of national political conflict in the future, and the prognosis for India is no different. In such scenario rain-water harvesting and desalination becomes inevitable. On a positive note, some areas of India are fortunate to have a relatively wet climate, even in the most arid regions. However, with no rain catchment programs in place, most of the water is displaced or dried up instead of used. In these areas, rain harvesting could be one solution for water collection. Collected water can be immediately used for agriculture, and with improved filtration practices to reduce water-borne pathogens, also quickly available for human consumption. Whatever the means, India needs solution. Children in 100 million homes in the country lack water, and one out of every two children are malnourished. Environmental justice needs to be restored to India so that families can raise their children with dignity, and providing water to communities is one such way to best ensure that chance.

With the emergency of mitigating the risk, satisfying future demand for groundwater, and improving resilience considering climate change, this study proposes a satellite-based approach to explore the spatio-temporal relationships between measured subsidence and hydrological variables in the basin to assist groundwater management strategy. We investigated ground subsidence in the basin using the SBAS-InSAR technique based on series of Sentinel-1A TOPS Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images acquired from 22 January 2016 to 21 October 2020 along ascending and descending tracks. The study showed average subsidence rates ranged from -97.5 mm/year to 10 mm/year in the basin after decomposing line-of-sight velocity fields to vertical components. The prominent subsidence was found in the eastern and western portions of the basin, and the maximum average subsidence rate was detected in the eastern part of the basin near Nazarlu. Correlation analysis between the surface subsidence and potential driving factors, including the actual evapotranspiration (ETa), land surface temperature (LST), the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), precipitation (P), and soil water index (SWI), revealed a significant relationship between the first three variables and observed subsidence by InSAR. A multivariate long short-term memory (LSTM) network was established to investigate the importance of the first three variables and predict subsidence in the near future. The result quantitatively revealed that the agricultural practice had a major impact on subsidence occurrence in the basin. Furthermore, our findings indicated that the area is estimated to continue subsiding dramatically in the next five years.

Therefore, we have tested seven advanced statistical models to connect characteristic discharges (mean and mean minimal discharge for a selected 30-year period) at measured points with attribute data describing the properties of the corresponding catchment. The 49 attribute values were gathered through analysis of spatial data in GIS environment and provided information about precipitation, temperature, geological structure, land use and water use in the area. According to the comparison of models performance we have selected the neural networks. They were used to estimate characteristic discharges in 340 selected points on the water courses all over the country. These values provide the basis for calculation of the ecologically acceptable flow and the amount of discharge available for use under certain terms. In addition, for the selected points (340 points) also the natural (reference) discharge was estimated as a discharge which would be observed without any water use present upstream. Simulations of natural discharge situation were performed for various scenarios and multiple selected test cases.

However, spatial error in these forecasts may reduce their utility when the costs of false positives and negatives differ greatly. Here we investigate whether deep learning methods can leverage spatial patterns in precipitation forecasts to (a) improve the skill of predicting the occurrence of precipitation events at lead times from 1 to 14 days, and (b) balance the tradeoff between the rate of false negatives and false positives by modifying the discrimination threshold of the classifiers. This approach is demonstrated for the Sacramento River Basin, California, using the Global Ensemble Forecast System (GEFS) v2 precipitation fields as input to convolutional neural network (CNN) and multi‐layer perceptron models. Results show that the deep learning models do not significantly improve the overall skill (F1 score) relative to the ensemble mean GEFS forecast with bias‐corrected threshold. However, additional analysis of the CNN models suggests they often correct missed predictions from GEFS by compensating for spatial error at longer lead times. Additionally, the deep learning models provide the ability to adjust the rate of false positives and negatives based on the ratio of costs. Finally, analysis of the network activations (saliency) indicates spatial patterns consistent with physical understanding of atmospheric river events in this region, lending additional confidence in the ability of the method to support water management applications.","",https://doi.org/10.1029/2021wr031910,"",,

The lack of water resources is a major challenge for the health and wellbeing of the world's population. This project aims to develop an artificial intelligence based water management system to optimize water resources. The system will provide a platform for water users and water managers to access information, solve problems and make informed decisions for water resource management. Resources of water management involve the supply, allocation and use of water, and the impact of these factors on ecosystems and human well-being. The overall goal of this project is to provide a platform for data to be stored, analyzed, and presented in a user-friendly way. The system will also be able to predict future water resource usage and monitor the status of water resources. The data will be provided by sensors, which will provide the data for the artificial intelligence system. This project will involve the creation of an artificial intelligent system that will be able to predict the future quality of water resources using a combination of data from sensors in the field and artificial intelligence. The artificial intelligent system will be utilized on a water quality management system such as a water treatment plant. The project will also involve the use of artificial intelligence based sensors, which will be capable of detecting water quality and producing a visual representation in the form of graphs on a tablet or PC screen.

rayyan-224220665,Machine Learning Model to Reproduce Nature-Based Solutions for Flood and Drought Mitigation,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Reducing the threat of severe spatiotemporal events like floods and droughts is raising concerns for water resource development and management. The severity of drought and floods increases more due to human interventions. Recent studies have focused on finding long-term solutions that mimic nature's process, while posing no environmental risks and targeting sustainability in traditional approaches. The terminology given in Europe for this natural solution is Nature-Based Solutions (NBS). Some examples of NBS are afforestation or reforestation, storage areas, vegetation buffers, and riparian forest. The main principle of NBS is that they slow down the rate of runoff by boosting interception, infiltration, or storage for flood water, hence mitigating the risk&amp;amp;#160;downstream. However, there is still not enough experimental nor theoretical experience on how they could be implemented to optimize their use. The way to represent NBS and the scale of implementation in models and real life is for now a process based on approximated propositions of the empirical knowledge of experts in the field. Although some experience have shown important contributions, this is not enough for an optimal implementation and a complete understanding of all possible outcomes. This is the problem expected to be addressed in this research. The main goal is to construct machine learning models to explore their use as an alternative (surrogate) that will aid in performing multiple scenario analyses of NBS, and quantifying their impacts. This approach will consider spatial and temporal data and create a link between several environmental variables and human actions without explicitly knowing the physical behavior of the system, yet clustering(grouping) behaviors or processes responses to structural properties of the hydrological model representation. The case study area for this research is the Bagmati River Basin of Nepal, covering a catchment area of 2822 sq. km, and the flow is dominated by spring and monsoon rainfall. Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) is used and the baseline scenario (without the implementation of NBS) is modeled. Different scenarios of afforestation, ponds, and conservation tillage will be intervened in the SWAT model and the changes made by those interventions will be replicated in Artificial Neural Network-Multi Layer Perceptron (ANN-MLP). Several unforeseen scenarios will also be tested in machine learning. Thus, the Spatio-temporal analysis will be done regarding the impact of NBS on the flows, and the machine learning model&amp;amp;#8217;s ability to replicate such complex systems will be evaluated.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#160;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The outcome presented here shows the construction of a SWAT model and the preliminary results of machine learning models capable of promptly predicting changes in flow induced by the adoption of various Nature-Based Solutions. It is anticipated to be a simple, effective, and time-saving way for studying the effectiveness of various Nature-Based Solutions for flood and drought mitigation. Thus, this study contributes to the experiences in interpreting and linking complex hydrological problems in machine learning systems.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#160;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Keywords:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; SWAT, Machine learning, Nature-Based Solutions, Hydrological extremes, Spatio-temporal analysis&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu22-11777,"",,

They are a recurrent, creeping meteorological hazard that may endanger the water and food security of large regions. The frequency and severity of droughts are expected to increase with climate change, especially in Africa, Central America, and also in Europe where annual losses may multiply by 7 and represent up to 2 times the size of the European economy in the medium-long term.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Drought Early Warning Systems (DEWS) are key pillars of a risk-based, proactive management strategy. The increasing number of sources of EO data has remarkedly improved the monitoring capabilities of DEWS. Despite there are good examples of global and regional drought monitoring systems, these tools still lack of seasonal forecasting capabilities able to provide enough accurate and specific predictions of drought impacts at the subregion level (e.g. basin, district). These deficiencies constitute a challenge for the scientific community and provide an opportunity to improve the current services.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;To address this gap in the DEWS landscape, the InfoSequia DEWS is developed to integrate the strengths of spatial, satellite-derived data with machine learning techniques for seasonal forecasting. InfoSequia consists of two modules:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;InfoSequia-MONITOR provides more than 50 drought predictors including meteorological (SPI, SPEI), vegetative (VCI / TCI / VHI), and hydrological (water level in reservoirs, groundwater storage status) drought indices, as well as atmospheric oscillation indices, all of them retrieved from satellite (e.g. MODIS, Sentinel-2, Sentinel-3, GRACE), hybrid (eg CHIRPS), or reanalysis and modeling (ERA5-Land) products. All indices are obtained from dekad values &amp;amp;#8203;&amp;amp;#8203; which are timescale aggregated at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months. The spatial resolution of the indices ranges from 5km (SPI, SPIE) to 250m (VH indices).&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt; &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Acknowledging the limitations of physically-based modelling on the seasonal time scale, the InfoSequia-4CAST module rests on the Fast and Frugal Tree (FFT) algorithm, a machine learning technique in which binary decision trees are trained and generated at the subregional level with the historical and spatially-aggregated predictors of drought. Final outputs are delivered in the form of monthly warnings of risk of failure up to 6 month lead times.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;All InfoSequia algorithms run on a cloud platform, with cloud geoprocessing functionalities.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;With support of the European Space Agency (ESA), InfoSequia is being developed and piloted to provide operational seasonal forecasts of: a) crop yield failures at the district level in Mozambique, and b) water supply failures in the Segura river basin in SE Spain.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Seasonal outlooks of drought impact support improvement of the water and food security of a region by allowing the early exploitation of groundwater reserves or unconventional water resources (desalination, reuse), the optimal water allocation of limited resources among users, or the implementation of ex-ante cash transfers or food vouchers.

rayyan-224220716,Climatic water balance forecasting with machine learning and deep learning models over Bangladesh,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract Understanding the impact of input variables on black‐box machine learning and deep learning models is necessary. Therefore, this study proposed SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values to address the problem of the interpretability of the output of the support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), convolutional neural network (CNN), and long short‐term memory (LSTM) models to forecast climatic water balance (CWB) within 1–3 months lead‐time. The current study uses two Koppen–Geiger climate zones over Bangladesh: the humid subtropical climate with dry winter and hot summer (Cwa) and the tropical climate (Af‐Am). Monthly antecedent CWB, potential evapotranspiration (PET), convective available potential energy (CAPE), relative humidity (RH), air temperature (TEM), El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO), Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD), and North Atlantic oscillation (NAO) are used as the inputs to the proposed model. SHAP values show that CWB (current month) for both climate zones has the maximum impact on the prediction. The effects of atmospheric variables and ocean–atmospheric teleconnections on CWB forecasts over Bangladesh are low. Forecasting results show that the SVM model shows the best performance for CWB forecasts in the Cwa and Af‐Am climate zones in terms of antecedent CWB as input. And this model effectively decreases the negative effect of increasing forecast lead‐time. Since the proposed model can predict CWB in 3‐months lead‐time, it would help policy‐makers and practitioners to reduce the drought and flood impacts in the future by adopting better preparedness plans.","",https://doi.org/10.1002/joc.7885,"",,

Hydrological models can assess natural hazards at regional scales when given high-resolution inputs of kilometer scales. Thus, to use the seasonal forecast ensembles for regional damage estimation, it is essential to increase the spatial resolution of these large sets of climate variables. Furthermore, the high-resolution data are adjusted to be physically consistent with the driving model in weather processes. Thanks to the latest advances in artificial intelligence, downscaling to high-resolution local data has become feasible. This study focuses on the comparison of three AI downscaling methods: multiple linear regression [2], artificial neural networks [3], and support vector machines [4]. In AI downscaling, the gridded data is used for model training and hyperparameter tuning. First, climate variables, including temperature, wind speed, precipitation, and solar radiation, are downscaled from 1&amp;amp;#176; to 1 km. The downscaling results are then evaluated using statistical indicators compared with the historical daily station observations.

As a result of overexploitation due to overpopulation, groundwater is severely deteriorating. Water Quality Index (WQI) is commonly used to appraise groundwater quality. In the present study, WQI model is developed to evaluate the groundwater quality in north Khartoum area. To classify water quality for diverse reasons, WQI uses multiple asset classes, sub-indices, and an accumulation function. Multivariate statistical analyses were applied to test the correlation between different variables to draw on the main variables and processes affecting the groundwater quality in the study area. Furthermore, correlation analysis (CA) and principal component analysis (PCA) served as guide for weights assignment in WQI calculations and interpretation. The innovative statistically guided WQI models (SWQI) proved to be superior in groundwater quality assessment. Although SWQI models is powerful and effective tool in groundwater assessment, however, conventional computation is lengthy, time consuming and is often observed with enormous errors during the calculation of sub-indices. In this study, artificial intelligence techniques are applied to cope with these limitations. Multilayer perceptron (MLP) and support vector regression (SVR) models were used for prediction of WQI. The dataset was divided into two groups (ratio 80:20) for training and validation respectively. The predicted models were compared with actual models using four statistical criteria, namely mean square error (MSE), root mean squared Error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and coefficient of determination (R 2 ). The obtained results revealed the robustness of the artificial intelligence in prediction of WQI in north Khartoum area.

Therefore, identifying the impact of different factors on sap flow can promote efficient water management and improve assessment of the climate change impacts. However, the interaction between sap flow and control factors is not clear, and there is no accurate model to predict sap flow change of Picea crassifolia Kom. This study explored the correlation between sap flow and environmental factors and compared the performances of the back‐propagation neural network (BP ANN ) and multiple regression (MLR) models, and the importance of the time‐lag effect and different soil moisture conditions in the response mechanism of sap flow was also explained. A higher fitting performance was found in the BP ANN model ( R 2 &gt; 0.90) based on the relationships between air temperature (Ta), air relative humidity (RH), solar radiation (Rn) and vapour pressure deficit (VPD) and sap flux density ( Q ) than that MLR ( R 2 = 0.8915). The correlation was improved due to the consideration of time‐lag effect. Other variables, such as maximum temperature (Tmax), wind speed (WS) and precipitation (P), explained smaller portions of the variance in sap flow, while minimum temperature (Tmin) and leaf area index (LAI) had almost no effect. Moreover, the R 2 of the water stress condition (REW &lt;0.38) was lower than that of the non‐water stress condition (REW ≥0.38), and even lower than the R 2 of the whole experimental period. Therefore, the sap flow prediction model based on BP ANN could more reasonably explain the nonlinear relationship between transpiration and control factors, which provided a basis for the estimation of plant water‐use and the construction and management of ecological vegetation in alpine arid and semi‐arid areas, especially in response to the continuous enhancement of aridification and climate warming.","",https://doi.org/10.1002/hyp.14490,"",,

This study investigated the impacts of climate change on the Kurau River in Malaysia using metalearning, an ensemble machine learning technique using support vector regression (SVR) and random forest (RF) coupled with the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project CMIP6 multi-Global Climate Model (GCM). Five global climate models and three shared socioeconomic pathways (SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, and SSP5-8.5) were used. The climate sequences generated by the delta change factor method were applied as input to the metalearning model to predict the streamflow changes in the Kurau River from 2021 to 2080. The model fitted reasonably well, with Kling–Gupta efficiency (KGE), Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), percent bias (PBias), and RMS Error (RMSE) of 0.79, 0.83, 2.52, and 4.51, respectively, for the training period (1976–1995) and 0.72, 0.72, 5.85, and 6.90, respectively, for the testing period (1995–2005). Future projections of multi-GCM over the 2021–2080 period under three SSPs predicted an increase in rainfall for all months except April–June during the dry period (off-season), with a higher increase occurring during the wet period (main season). Temperature projections indicated an increase in maximum and minimum temperatures under all SSP scenarios, with a higher increase of approximately 2.0°C under SSP5-8.5 predicted during the 2051–2080 period relative to the baseline period of 1976–2005. The model predicted that the seasonal changes in streamflow of two planting periods range between −7.5% and 7.1% and between 1.2% and 5.9% during the off-season and the main season, respectively. A significant streamflow decrease was predicted in April and May for all SSP scenarios due to high temperatures during the off-season, with SSP5-8.5 being the worst. The impact assessment of climate variabilities on the availability of water resources is vital to identify appropriate adaptation strategies to deal with an expected increase in irrigation demand due to global warming in the future. The predicted future streamflow under the potential climate change impacts is crucial for the Bukit Merah Reservoir to establish suitable operational policies for irrigation release.","",https://doi.org/10.1061/(asce)he.1943-5584.0002176,"",,

Therefore, the present study focused on understanding the spatiotemporal variations of hydroclimatic variables namely rainfall, surface runoff, water yield, and the Aridity Index (AI) of the Krishna River Basin (KRB) under combined impact of climate and Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) change scenarios. From trend analysis, the best model (CNRM-CM5 driven RCM) projected an increasing trend in rainfall under both RCP 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios for the entire century. Results indicated that, except for the central part, most of KRB experiences high runoff and water yield conditions under both RCP 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios in the mid and end centuries, conversely it may face low runoff and water yield conditions in the early century. Most of the central part is in arid and semi-arid conditions and, the eastern part of the basin is in dry sub-humid conditions, while the Western Ghats, Palleru, and Munneru regions of the basin fall under humid and hyper humid regions under RCP 4.5 scenario. Whereas the majority of the basin falls under humid and hyper humid regions under RCP 8.5 scenario except for the central and few other parts of the basin.

These agro-ecosystem services also provide significant economic benefits to people and the socio-economic development of a country. However, the sustainability of agro-ecosystem services is threatened by climate change and variability. Agro-ecosystem models have been recognized as a potential tool to understand the interaction between climate and other components of an agro-ecosystem and identify the best management practices for sustainable management of the system. This chapter presents the application of the agro-ecosystem models to simulate some of the water-regulating agro-ecosystem services under climate change scenarios in India. Simulation models have been successfully applied for the infiltration, groundwater recharge, evapotranspiration, evaporation, runoff, water storage, and soil erosion as the water-regulating agro-ecosystem services. The application of various infiltration models developed in India has effectively been demonstrated for both constant and variable depth of water for a variety of soils. A large variation in potential groundwater recharge both in time and space has been recorded for the soybean [ Glycine max (L.) Merr.] cropping system under different soils using the HYDRUS-1D model. Simulated potential groundwater recharge from water harvesting structures (WHS) by the integrated potential groundwater recharge simulation (IPGRS) model ranged from 83.0 to 90.2% of the accumulated surface runoff in the WHS. Different hydrological models, such as the Precipitation Runoff Modeling Systems (PRMS), and the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) have been applied successfully to various river basins of India for modeling climate change impact on water resources. Simulation of soil erosion—using the revised universal soil loss equation (RUSLE) model under HADCM3 model simulated climate change scenarios under SRES A2 emission scenarios—showed an increase in soil erosion from 58 to 59% for the different land-use systems with an increase of 58% in annual rainfall during the 2080s (2071–2099). Simulation studies conducted on some water-regulating agro-ecosystem services using hydrological models with different climate change projections and downscaling approaches showed varied hydrological responses of land-use systems and river basins in agro-ecosystems of India to the future climate change scenarios. In conclusion, these agro-ecosystem modeling applications tested in the semi-arid region of India can be extended to other agro-ecological regions of the world for better understanding and quantifying water-regulating agro-ecosystem services.

rayyan-224221091,AIoT@Water - An Intelligent Water Resources Management System,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"This study constructs an Intelligent Internet-of-Things (IoT) architecture for water resource management called AIoT@Water system. There have been many studies on water management with the internet of things, but still have not considered using artificial intelligence and rainfall calculations. The proposed AIoT@Water system provides a dynamic perception adjustment mechanism in the sensing operations. It adjusts the sensing frequency according to the environmental risk, which can reduce the usual transmission times to achieve energy-saving benefits and improve the immediacy of data during disasters. This study set up a simulation field according to the water conservancy facilities' actual terrain and parameters, and IoT sensing is deployed to simulate rainfall and drainage. The RMSE of the flooding result is predicted in an existed SIMBA-Sewer simulator to be 0.443; the result of the AIoT@Water system is 0.367. The results can prove that the proposed AIoT@Water system is more accurate than the sewer simulator and can provide the decision-makers with a reference for disaster prevention","",https://doi.org/10.1109/icoiact55506.2022.9971964,"",,
rayyan-224221092,Machine-Learning Models to Improve Accuracy of Real-Time Reference Evapotranspiration Estimates in an Arid Environment,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Studies of the estimation of reference evapotranspiration (ET0) in Iran are mostly related to areas with humid and semiarid climates and less related to arid areas. On the other hand, few studies in arid regions have reported high root-mean square error (RMSE) values. However, these regions make an important contribution to agricultural production, and thus, water management of these regions is crucial. It motivated the implementation of such a study in an arid environment of Karaj, Iran, as a case study, in order to estimate daily ET0 with as much accuracy as possible. To achieve this purpose, the performance of 21 known models estimating ET0, including 9 empirical models and 12 machine learning (ML) models, were evaluated. The method provided by the food and agriculture organization (FAO) known as FAO-56 Penman-Monteith (FPM) was regarded as the main reference method for measuring ET0. A new climate data set related to the period of 2005–2020 (April–September) was used to calibrate and cross-validate models. In fact, this study intended to develop an approach for simulating day-to-day variations in ET0 in arid environments by benefitting minimal weather data (i.e., temperature, humidity, and wind speed) for practical purposes because most regions suffer from a lack of weather data, especially radiation data. Therefore, the performance of the best models calibrated in Karaj station was also validated based on data recorded in a research field with a similar climate during 2020–2021. The cross-validated results showed that the deep-learning (DL) model had the lowest RMSE as well as the highest R2 compared with other models. As averaged over all months in Karaj, the DL model exhibited a RMSE 64% less than the best-calibrated empirical model (i.e., Valiantzas-VTS), which is a solar radiation–based model. Furthermore, the improvements arising from using the DL model were more considerable in the extremes than in the middle values. The findings of the field research also demonstrated that the approach developed in the current study would be beneficial at locations other than the calibration station. This approach requires few inputs, is independent of solar radiation data, and also has the lowest RMSE compared with that of other studies. For future studies, the combination of the daily ET0 estimator developed in this study with a recently developed empirical approach to estimate crop coefficients is suggested to manage irrigation on croplands if arid regions.","",https://doi.org/10.1061/(asce)ir.1943-4774.0001714,"",,

rayyan-224221305,Seasonal Precipitation forecasting with large scale climate predictors: A hybrid &amp;#160;wavelet multiresolution -NARX scheme,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Much of northern Tunisia regularly experiences extremes of drought and flooding, with high rainfall variability. Development of reliable and accurate seasonal rainfall forecasts can provide valuable information to help mitigate some of the outcome of floods and enhance water management, particularly for agriculture. Ensemble monthly rainfall forecasts are carried out over horizons ranging from 1 to 6 months using a hybrid wavelet neural network model. The hybrid model called MWD-NARX based on a non-linear autoregressive network with exogenous inputs (NARX) coupled to multiresolution wavelet decomposition (MWD) is developed in this work. First, The MWD is used to decompose the data into different components on various time scale. Then to predict each precipitation decomposition the NARX ensemble model is employed. For an operational forecasting, the forecasts obtained from the decompositions are summed to represent the true precipitation forecast value. The outcomes of MWD-NARX are compared with Artificial Neural Networks (ANN).&amp;amp;#160;The seasonal forecasts of average precipitation by sub-basins of the Medjerda river basin are carried out. Large scale climate teleconnection indicators of ENSO, PDO, NAO and Mediterranean Oscillation were used as inputs to the model. The results indicate that exogenous inputs like climatic indices clearly improves the accuracy of forecasts in terms of the coefficient R&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; on 82% of SBVs compared to a model that uses only climate indices as inputs with 1 month delay time. It increases then the forecast lead-time up to 6 months. The same conclusion is made when compared to an ANN. The correlation coefficient between observed and forecasted monthly precipitation is ranging from 0.5 to 0.8. It was also found that the MWD-NARX underestimates the extremes. The spatial variability of the quality of the forecasts depends mainly on the local effect of precipitation more than on the quality of the hydrological data observed on the forecasts. It can be concluded that exogenous inputs like climate indices can add some additional information to enhance monthly precipitation forecasts at longer lead-times. The forecasting model coupled to data pre-processing method made it possible to produce very satisfactory forecasts of non-stationary data by extracting significant modes of variability.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;","",https://doi.org/10.5194/iahs2022-732,"",,
rayyan-224221356,floodGAN &amp;#8211; A deep learning-based model for rapid urban flood forecasting,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Recent urban flood events revealed how severe and fast the impacts of heavy rainfall can be. Pluvial floods pose an increasing risk to communities worldwide due to ongoing urbanization and changes in climate patterns. Still, pluvial flood warnings are limited to meteorological forecasts or water level monitoring which are insufficient to warn people against the local and terrain-specific flood risks. Therefore, rapid flood models are essential to implement effective and robust early warning systems to mitigate the risk of pluvial flooding. Although hydrodynamic (HD) models are state-of-the-art for simulation pluvial flood hazards, the required computation times are too long for real-time applications.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In order to overcome the computation time bottleneck of HD models, the deep learning model floodGAN has been developed. FloodGAN combines two adversarial Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) that are trained on high-resolution rainfall-flood data generated from rainfall generators and HD models. FloodGAN translates the flood forecasting problem into an image-to-image translation task whereby the model learns the non-linear spatial relationships of rainfall and hydraulic data. Thus, it directly translates spatially distributed rainfall forecasts into detailed hazard maps within seconds. Next to the inundation depth, the model can predict the velocities and time periods of hydraulic peaks of an upcoming rainfall event. Due to its image-translation approach, the floodGAN model can be applied for large areas and can be run on standard computer systems, fulfilling the tasks of fast and practical flood warning systems.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;To evaluate the accuracy and generalization capabilities of the floodGAN model, numerous performance tests were performed using synthetic rainfall events as well as a past heavy rainfall event of 2018. Therefore, the city of Aachen was used as a case study. Performance tests demonstrated a speedup factor of 10&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;6&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; compared to HD models while maintaining high model quality and accuracy and good generalization capabilities for highly variable rainfall events. Improvements can be obtained by integrating recurrent neural network architectures and training with temporal rainfall series to forecast the dynamics of the flooding processes.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu22-4730,"",,

In this study, sub-diurnal to climatological temporal changes of evaporation in a high-altitude saline lake ecosystem in the Atacama Desert are analysed. We analyse the evaporation trends over 70 years (1950-2020) at a high-spatial resolution. The method is based on the downscaling of 30-km hourly resolution ERA5 reanalysis data to 0.1-km spatial resolution data using artificial neural networks. This downscaled data is used in the Penman open water evaporation equation, modified to compensate for the energy balance non-closure and the ice cover formation on the lake during the night. Our evaporation estimates show a consistent agreement with eddy-covariance measurements and reveal that evaporation is controlled by different drivers depending on the time scale. At the sub-diurnal scale, mechanical turbulence is the primary driver. At the seasonal scale, more than 70% of the evaporation variability is explained by the radiative contribution term. At interannual scales, evaporation increased by 2.1 mm per year during the entire study period according to global temperature increases. Last, we find that yearly evaporation depends on the El Ni&amp;amp;#241;o Southern Oscillation (ENSO), where warm and cool ENSO phases are associated with higher evaporation rates and precipitation rates, respectively. Our results show that warm ENSO phases increase evaporation rates by 15%, whereas cold phases decrease by 2%. This investigation contributes with reliable long-term evaporation estimates over a typical saline lake of an arid region and a replicable methodology for climate change assessment and sustainable water management.&amp;amp;#160;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu22-5021,"",,

We propose to predict near-surface velocity profiles from surface-waves transformed to phase velocity-frequency panels in a data-driven manner using deep neural networks. This is a different approach from many recent works that attempt to estimate velocity from directly reflected body waves or guided waves. A secondary objective is to analyze the influence on the prediction accuracy of various commonly employed deep learning practices, such as transfer learning and data augmentations. Through numerical experiments on synthetic data as well as a real geophysical example, we demonstrate that transfer learning as well as data augmentations are helpful when using deep learning for velocity estimation. A third and final objective is to study lack of generalization of deep learning models for out-of-distribution (OOD) data in the context of our problem, and present a novel approach to tackle it. We propose a domain adaptation network for training deep learning models that uses a priori knowledge on the range of velocity values in order to constrain mapping of the output. The final comparison on field data, which was not part of the training data, show the deep neural network predictions compare favorably with a conventional velocity model estimation obtained with a dispersion curve inversion workflow.

rayyan-224221427,Towards capturing bedform transition: harnessing capabilities of CFD bedform models and machine learning,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Our understanding of bedform processes and their associated effect on bedform roughness is limited, and accounts for large uncertainties in hydraulic roughness computation. It is a standard practice in hydraulic modelling to consider hydraulic roughness as a roughness coefficient and to calibrate the model to this coefficient. Such an approach is empirical and does not well capture the physical processes involved in hydraulic roughness dynamics. When bedforms are present, they can account for a significant portion of hydraulic roughness. Consequently, when bedform transitions occur, an abrupt and significant disruption in the hydraulic roughness regime occurs; affecting our water management applications, such as navigability, flood risk management, sediment transport, etc. Bedform transitions are rarely captured, either in laboratory or in real-scale river channels. As such, our understanding of such transition behaviour is further constrained.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In this research, we modelled a CFD physics-based bedform model for the Chiyoda channel, Japan based on previous study of Yamaguchi et al. (2019). The model configuration and results of that study had been validated. The CFD model was initialized at flat-bed condition and run till a dynamic equilibrium in dune regime was obtained. In our research, we captured the bedform in this simulation in each time step, effectively obtaining a timeseries of bed evolution from flatbed regime to dune regime.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It is hoped, the use of physics-based CFD models can simulate the physical processes that invoke bedform transitions. As these have not been easily observed in the field or in lab, the simulations can provide an important insight into these complex processes. This is particularly important in the context of changing hydraulic regimes under the changing climate scenario &amp;amp;#8211; possibly making past calibrations of river systems incompatible in the future. An alternative to physics-based (CFD) model is the use of a data-driven model (using machine learning techniques). The use of surrogate machine learning models that capture the behaviour of these physics-based (CFD) models, provides an advantage in terms of computational cost and computational time.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We also developed a proof-of-concept artificial neural network ML models to predict dune height and mean flow depth respectively based on the CFD model results as input. Several models were built using various combinations of input variables: the lagged values of dune height and mean flow depth, mean flow depth or dune height (alternatively), as well as the present and lagged values of spectral power from Fast Fourier Transform spectral analysis. The lagged values of the predicted variable were the most important input parameters compared to other variables. The use of spectral power as predictive variable did not much improve the results, owing to a strong cross-correlation of the parameter with dune height and mean flow depth.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Alternative predictive variables such as stream discharge, Froude number, etc may be considered in future studies to ensure better prediction ability. Validation of these ML and physics-based CFD model results remain a challenge as bedform transition timeseries dataset is not much available. Future outlook of the research in this direction is discussed.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu22-2398,"",,

The present work provides ground-truth data in order to calibrate the modelling approaches with the regional climate model REMO and the regional soil moisture model WaSiM-ETH.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Lower Franconia belongs to those regions in Germany which are expected to be strongly affected by climate change. Regional climate models show that average temperatures will rise and dry periods as well as extreme precipitation events occur more frequently. However, the consequences of changing climate conditions on soils, landscapes as well as on land use are not sufficiently known for Lower Franconia.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Yields of forestry and agriculture depend very much on the availability of soil water. During the growing season the water retention capacity of soils is therefore highly relevant. Up to present, datasets as well as modelling results of future scenarios on soil moisture are only scarcely available on local as well as on regional scale. In order to generate future scenarios, calculation of the soil moisture regime forms the base in order to evaluate present day conditions as well as to develop prognostic studies. As we intend to obtain most realistic parameters, generation of real-time soil moisture data with high temporal resolution at selected sites is crucial. Our monitoring sites are characteristic for Lower Franconia and serve to calibrate regions for modelling approaches.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In order to obtain data on dynamics and causes of soil moisture fluctuations as well as to understand process flows, soil geographical surveys form an essential component of our research design for selected sites related to the monitoring stations. Furthermore, relevant sedimentological and pedological parameters such as grain size distribution, permeability, and bulk density are analyzed in the laboratory. Thus, our representative test sites combine detailed ground-truth data with soil moisture and thus, form consecutive modules as parts of soil moisture models. These modules drive and control the modelling procedures of the sub-projects and they further serve for assessments and calibration of the area-wide hydrological and climate modelling in the &amp;amp;#8220;BigData@Geo&amp;amp;#8221; ERDF-project.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Based on our data we can provide qualitative soil moisture information to the public, such as precipitation and infiltration thresholds and seasonal patterns. Combined with the real-time availability of the monitoring data via our online platform &amp;amp;#8220;Klimaatlas Unterfranken&amp;amp;#8221;, we provide valuable information for the shareholders decision making process &amp;amp;#8211; regarding for instance plant health, risk assessment during extreme weather events or adapting their businesses to the future climate and soil moisture conditions.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu22-2621,"",,
rayyan-224221470,Do changes in tree‐ring δ<sup>18</sup>O indicate changes in stomatal conductance?,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Plant scientists have long been fascinated by the balance between photosynthetic carbon gain and transpirational water loss in terrestrial plants, because such a balance can have wide-ranging implications with respect to plant productivity and survival, ecosystem service and function, and even global-scale hydrology and climate forcing (Cowan & Farquhar, 1977; Bonan, 2008; Keenan et al., 2013). Intrinsic water use efficiency (iWUE, defined as the ratio of photosynthetic rate, A, to stomatal conductance, gs) is a frequently used trait to assess plant carbon–water balance. Due to the well-established, theoretical link between iWUE and photosynthetic carbon isotope discrimination (Farquhar et al., 1982), analysis of plant carbon isotope composition (δ13Cplant) has emerged as a popular method of estimating time-integrated iWUE during plant growth. However, the carbon isotope technique alone does not allow partitioning of iWUE between its component gas-exchange parameters (i.e. A and gs), and so is deemed to be insufficiently informative for a mechanistic understanding of iWUE responses to abiotic/biotic factors (Scheidegger et al., 2000; Farquhar et al., 2007). To address this limitation, researchers have suggested adding plant oxygen isotope composition (δ18O) into the isotope toolbox to help tease apart the influences of A vs gs on δ13Cplant-derived iWUE (Scheidegger et al., 2000; Grams et al., 2007). This suggestion stemmed from the theoretical prediction that, for plants exposed to similar environmental conditions, gs should exhibit a negative relationship with transpirative enrichment of leaf lamina water (Δ18Olw), and hence with the isotope composition of cellulose (δ18Ocel), which is known to preserve much of the Δ18Olw signal (Barbour et al., 2000; Scheidegger et al., 2000; Farquhar et al., 2007). In this case 'similar environmental conditions' refers primarily to similar δ18O of source water (δ18Osw) and ambient relative humidity (RH), as these are two important controlling factors of δ18Ocel. The predicted negative association of gs with δ18Ocel has gained support from the results of several glasshouse and field tests on different plant species (Barbour et al., 2000; Barbour & Farquhar, 2000; Scheidegger et al., 2000; Sullivan & Welker, 2006; Grams et al., 2007; Moreno-Gutiérrez et al., 2011), and consequently has resulted in the use of δ18Ocel as a proxy for gs to aid interpretation of physiological underpinnings of iWUE in numerous investigations (Siegwolf et al., 2021). While the early glasshouse/field examinations were conducted in ways to satisfy the 'similar growth environment' prerequisite of the theoretical negative gs–δ18Ocel relationship, an increasing number of 18O applications have instead focused on tree-ring cellulose in a temporal context, to gain retrospective insights into tree canopy gs responses to global change factors (Nock et al., 2011; Barnard et al., 2012; Fajardo et al., 2019; Guerrieri et al., 2019; Savard et al., 2020; Mathias & Thomas, 2021). Field-grown trees commonly experience pronounced interannual variations in δ18Osw and/or RH, so tree-ring cellulose δ18O (δ18Otr-cel)-based gs reconstructions do not necessarily conform to the 'similar growth environment' prerequisite. Several authors have thus urged caution over this type of temporal-context application (Roden & Siegwolf, 2012; Gessler et al., 2018), with Roden & Siegwolf (2012) explicitly highlighting several caveats/complexities that require attention, and recommending that one should rigorously account for the confounding isotopic and environmental variations either through measurement or modeling, if the goal is to assess the physiological responses that influence the measured δ18Otr-cel chronology. In this context, it is important to note that Guerrieri et al. (2019) recently developed a method to take care of the confounding variations in their attempt to infer temporal changes in gs from δ18Otr-cel. The method involves converting δ18Otr-cel to Δ18Olw following a three-step process: first, by assuming the local, current-year precipitation as the dominant source for tree source water, the δ18Osw of each year is simulated from climatic factors of the same year using a globally derived empirical model of precipitation δ18O (δ18Oprep; Barbour et al., 2001); second, tree-ring cellulose 18O enrichment above the source water (Δ18Otr-cel) is then calculated from the simulated δ18Oprep and the measured δ18Otr-cel; and third, the resultant Δ18Otr-cel chronology is subsequently used to derive a Δ18Olw chronology by inverting the well-established mechanistic model of Δ18Otr-cel (Sternberg, 2009), with potential climatic sensitivity of the model parameters (i.e. carbonyl oxygen exchange rate or pex) explicitly considered. Specifically, Guerrieri et al. (2019) suggested that one should check for interannual variation in RH, a potential driver of temporal variation in Δ18Olw. In cases where RH does not display an apparent trend during the time span encompassed by the δ18Otr-cel chronology, a negative gs–Δ18Olw relationship can be safely used to infer historical changes of gs from the derived Δ18Olw chronology. That is, when 'no systematic RH trend' is detected, a significant correlation between the derived Δ18Olw and time suggests a significant change in gs over time (the direction of which is opposite in sign from the calculated correlation coefficient or regression slope), while an insignificant correlation suggests gs remained relatively constant. By applying the above method to 12 tree species from eight forested sites in North America, Guerrieri et al. (2019) found that reductions in gs over the last 30 years were restricted to species from xeric sites. This result, combined with the tree-ring δ13C data showing a consistent increase in iWUE in response to rising atmospheric CO2 across all the sites, prompted the authors to reject the hypothesis that rising iWUE in forests 'is primarily caused by the widespread, CO2-induced reductions in gs' (Guerrieri et al., 2019). More recently, this method was also used by Mathias & Thomas (2021) in a meta-analysis of tree-ring isotope chronologies from 34 species across 84 sites globally. The results indicated no significant historical changes in gs over the past century in a majority (77.9%) of the tree–site combinations analyzed, again 'challenging the idea of widespread reductions in gs as the major driver of increasing tree iWUE' in response to past atmospheric CO2 increases (Mathias & Thomas, 2021). However, is the method proposed by Guerrieri et al. (2019) robust enough to guarantee a reliable inference of temporal directionality of changes in gs from δ18Otr-cel? Here, by examining this method in detail we highlight three aspects of insufficiency, each of which in our opinion is severe enough to render this method to be ineffective, as far as a δ18Otr-cel-based gs reconstruction is concerned. First, in Guerrieri et al. (2019) and Mathias & Thomas (2021), temporal changes in δ18Osw at each site were simulated using a spatial δ18Oprep model developed empirically by Barbour et al. (2001; hereafter the Barbour model). Such a 'space-for-time' substitution assumed that the environmental influences on δ18Oprep were the same across space and through time. However, it has long been recognized that the drivers of temporal variability in δ18Oprep can vary from site to site (Dansgaard, 1964; Gat et al., 2001). With this concern in mind, we tested the ability of the Barbour model for predicting the δ18Oprep variability at the site level using the δ18Oprep datasets archived in the Global Network of Isotopes in Precipitation (GNIP; https://www.iaea.org/services/networks/gnip). It turned out that only one (Ottawa, Canada) out of the eight selected sites displayed a significantly positive relationship between the simulated and the observed interannual variations in δ18Oprep, and the slope coefficients for the regression of the simulated δ18Oprep on the observed δ18Oprep were all far from unity (Fig. 1). This analysis (see Fig. 1 legend for more details) revealed that the Barbour model, for the most part, performed poorly in capturing the site-specific, temporal dynamics of δ18Oprep. As accurate prediction of δ18Oprep is critical in determining Δ18Otr-cell and/or Δ18Olw from δ18Otr-cell, the use of an unconfirmed spatial model is not appropriate for producing trustworthy time series of Δ18Otr-cel and/or Δ18Olw at each site. Interestingly, this point is evident in Guerrieri et al.'s (2019) own data (fig. S9 from Guerrieri et al., 2019), showing that the δ18Otr-cel-derived Δ18Olw could be quite different (i.e. by up to 5‰) from the actual measurement of Δ18Olw. While predicting large-scale spatiotemporal δ18Oprep is challenging (Terzer-Wassmuth et al., 2021), better options such as IsoMAP (Bowen et al., 2014) and IsoGSM (Yoshimura et al., 2008) do exist. Notably, Nelson et al. (2021) recently developed a machine learning approach to simulate temporal (intra and interannual resolution) δ18Oprep variations in Europe, and their simulations were substantially better than the existing models. We expect this promising modeling framework to be readily extended to other regions and deliver reliable estimates of δ18Oprep for retrospective research in tree-ring stable isotopes. Further, due to the complex mechanisms regulating soil water available for plant uptake (Allen et al., 2019; Goldsmith et al., 2022), the aforementioned assumption that local, current-year precipitation is the major source of tree source water might not always be met. If this is the case, isotope-enabled hydrological models can be helpful in capturing species-specific dynamics of δ18Osw at high temporal resolutions (Ogée et al., 2009; Brinkmann et al., 2018). Second, in their attempts to infer the directional changes in gs from the δ18Otr-cel-derived Δ18Olw chronology, both Guerrieri et al. (2019) and Mathias & Thomas (2021) considered the negative gs–Δ18Olw relationship to be universally applicable to all species included in their studies. The negative gs–Δ18Olw relationship was derived from the theoretical analyses of how gs modifies several isotopic/physiological parameters imbedded in the widely used Δ18Olw model that incorporates a Péclet effect (Sullivan & Welker, 2006; Grams et al., 2007; Roden & Siegwolf, 2012). Here, note that for plant cellulose-related isotopic signatures, the term Péclet effect implicitly refers to leaf lamina-associated radial Péclet effect, which by definition represents the relative balance between advection of unenriched leaf vein water via the transpiration stream and back diffusion of the enriched water from the evaporative sites in the leaf lamina (Farquhar & Lloyd, 1993). It is worth emphasizing that at the time when the gs–Δ18Olw negative relationship was theoretically inferred, it was conveniently assumed that: (1) the Péclet effect is pervasively present in different species, and (2) a key component governing the Péclet effect − known as the effective pathlength of water movement inside the leaf lamina or L − is a species-specific constant (Barbour & Farquhar, 2004; Kahmen et al., 2009). Under these assumptions, it can be predicted that Péclet-mediated isotope dynamics is a viable mechanism driving the negative gs–Δ18Olw association, as, for example, an increase in gs and/or transpiration rate (E) is predicted to cause a concomitant increase in the advective flux of unenriched xylem water to the leaf lamina, consequently leading to a decrease in Δ18Olw (Guerrieri et al., 2019). However, more recent studies have yielded experimental evidence that is inconsistent with either of the above two Péclet-related assumptions. For example, in their experimental survey of 27 species, Barbour et al. (2021) found that the Péclet effect was present in only 10 (37%) species; this indicates that the Péclet effect should not be taken for granted for all plant species (Song et al., 2015; Holloway-Phillips et al., 2016), thereby invalidating assumption 1. Furthermore, even for species in which the Péclet effect is operational, evidence has been mounting that L within a given species is variable and related to leaf transpiration rate (Ferrio et al., 2012; Song et al., 2013; Roden et al., 2015; but see Kahmen et al., 2009 for an exception), meaning that the 'species-specific L' assumption (assumption 2) is not necessarily valid. To examine the dynamics of Δ18Olw in response to gs with the updated knowledge related to the two assumptions, we performed a simple modeling exercise under three scenarios: no Péclet effect, a conventional Péclet effect (hereafter 'Péclet effect with a constant L') and a Péclet effect with a variable L based on an empirically determined L–E negative power relationship (Song et al., 2013). Given the annual resolution and integration of whole-canopy activities of tree-ring isotopic signatures, an isotopic steady state was assumed during our Δ18Olw modeling, similar to Roden & Siegwolf (2012). For demonstration purposes, we considered typical growing season environmental conditions for temperate trees (as detailed in the legend to Fig. 2) and simulated leaf temperature (Tl) at a given gs following Campbell & Norman (1998) before simulation of Δ18Olw (refer to Supporting Information Methods S1 for simulation details). The modeling results revealed a much-dampened sensitivity of Δ18Olw to gs under the 'no Péclet effect' scenario (gray dashed line in Fig. 2) than under the 'Péclet effect with a constant L' scenario (light blue line in Fig. 2). Concerning the 'no Péclet effect' scenario in particular, it can be seen that for every 0.1 mol m−2 s−1 change in gs, there is on average a change in Δ18Olw of −0.5‰, which can be translated to a −0.3‰ change in Δ18Otr-cel if the standard assumption is made that 60% of the Δ18Olw signal gets imprinted onto Δ18Otr-cel (Roden et al., 2000). Such a result − when viewed in the context of cellulose 18O measurement precisions typically reported in the literature (±0.3‰; Boettger et al., 2007) − leads us to suggest that an unambiguous detection of the gs signal in Δ18Otr-cel may not always be possible when the Péclet effect is absent. In this regard, it should be noted that a recent study combining isotope measurements with leaf hydraulic design considerations has identified coniferous needles as being more likely to fall into the 'no Péclet effect' category than broadleaf trees (Barbour et al., 2021). If this is the case (but see Roden et al., 2015), we would expect greater difficulty in detecting a true gs signal from isotope chronologies of conifers than from broadleaf trees, assuming everything else is equal. Such interspecies differences may at least partially explain why proportionally fewer conifers than broadleaf trees exhibited a significant gs changing trend in the metadataset of Mathias & Thomas (2021). The simulation we performed under the 'Péclet effect with a variable L' scenario yielded a pattern (dark blue line in Fig. 2) showing that the gs–Δ18Olw relationship was no longer negative, but nonmonotonic. That is, Δ18Olw increased with gs at low gs but decreased at high gs. As such, we conclude from our modeling results that the strength and direction of the gs–Δ18Olw relationship can be variable, depending on the specific parameter space confined by the species and its environment. As aforementioned, this modeling exercise was based on a commonly adopted steady-state assumption, and so did not consider nonsteady-state isotope dynamics under which more complicated processes involving a role of δ18Ov through vapor one-way flux through stomata (Lehmann et al., 2018, 2020; Farquhar et al., 2021) as well as its potential interaction with the Péclet-caused within-leaf enrichment gradients may also serve to mediate the gs–Δ18Olw relationship. Notwithstanding this, our modeling purpose was to demonstrate a diverse gs–Δ18Olw relationship by incorporating recent advances in 18O modeling and was not to provide an exhaustive survey on all possible patterns. Therefore, given the uncertainties in the validity of the Péclet-related assumptions, we consider it imprudent to assume a priori all species under different environmental/physiological conditions to consistently display a negative gs–Δ18Olw correlation that is strong enough for gs reconstruction. Third, as discussed above, interannual environmental fluctuations can be pronounced in long-term field studies such as Guerrieri et al.'s (2019), making the 'similar growth environment' prerequisite a challenge to satisfy. Among the multiple environmental variables, RH is usually the most important control for Δ18Olw (see Simonin et al., 2013 for a demonstration of their sensitivity analysis). Presumably for this reason, Guerrieri et al. (2019) proposed to relax the 'similar RH' requirement to a less stringent 'no systematic RH trend' one for applying the negative gs–Δ18Olw relationship. From a statistical perspective, increased data variability increases the likelihood of mistakenly accepting the null hypothesis (i.e. the Type II error, see Ott & Longnecker, 2001) if sample size remains the same. Thus, allowing RH as well as other environmental variables such as atmospheric water vapor δ18O (Gat et al., 2001; Munksgaard et al., 2020) to fluctuate from year to year (in spite of no systematic trend) could introduce additional variability to Δ18Olw, in turn lowering the probability of detecting a significant correlation between the derived Δ18Olw and time, if it actually exists. That is, the tree–site combinations with a true directional change in gs over time may be mistakenly judged as those without, due to the background 'noise' in Δ18Olw produced by environmental fluctuations. As a result, even with the assumptions that δ18Osw was adequately simulated and a negative gs–Δ18Olw relationship is robust for use in Mathias & Thomas (2021), the insignificant correlation between the derived Δ18Olw and time in 77.9% of their tree–site combinations may not be interpreted with certainty that gs remained relatively constant in these cases. Our analyses have highlighted three outstanding issues related to the method proposed by Guerrieri et al. (2019) for retrospectively inferring gs changes from tree-ring cellulose δ18O chronologies: the proposed use of a δ18Oprep spatial model does not guarantee accurate estimation of interannual variation in δ18Osw, making the practice of converting δ18Otr-cell to Δ18Olw prone to error; due to the complications related to the Péclet effect, no universal gs–Δ18Olw relationship can be applied to interpret variations in Δ18Olw; and even in a case where a negative gs–Δ18Olw/Δ18Otr-cel relationship is robust, the varied interannual environmental influences on Δ18Olw/Δ18Otr-cel may produce a strong background 'noise', impeding an effective detection of the gs 'signal' preserved in Δ18Olw/Δ18Otr-cel. These highlighted uncertainties aside, it is also important to note that the required conversion of δ18Otr-cel to Δ18Olw in Guerrieri et al.'s (2019) method hinges upon the current mechanistic model of δ18Otr-cel, yet the mechanisms driving interannual variability in certain model parameters (e.g. pex) are far from being sufficiently understood (Song et al., 2015; Cheesman & Cernusak, 2017; Szejner et al., 2020), which could further undermine the credibility of this method. Because these concerns were not adequately addressed by Guerrieri et al. (2019) and Mathias & Thomas (2021), the gs patterns inferred from δ18Otr-cell in these studies (i.e. gs remained relatively unchanged in a majority of their sites) should be viewed with skepticism. In spite of the criticisms raised in this Letter, we remain optimistic that the dual isotope approach holds great promise for improving our understanding of the physiological responses of plants to the environment (Siegwolf et al., 2021). Nevertheless, it is necessary to note that previous experimental verifications of this approach have focused largely on leaf-level, 'side-by-side comparison' scenarios; in the only tree-ring-targeted, controlled experimental testing performed so far, Roden & Farquhar (2012) showed that the dual isotope framework was not fully operational. Future studies aiming to use the dual isotope approach at the tree-ring level should perform experiments to clarify scenarios where the gs signal can be detected from the tree-ring cellulose, and/or rigorously evaluate and constrain the uncertainties outlined in this Letter by examining relevant species traits and associated environmental conditions on a case-by-case basis, so as to improve confidence in the gs information extracted from the δ18Otr-cel time series.

rayyan-224221492,Addressing hydrological science problems in the Yangtze River: An integrated water systems approach,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The Yangtze River is the largest river and is called the mother river in China. Since the economic reform initiated in 1979, remarkable economic growth has been associated with large campaigns of exploitation in the Yangtze River Basin. Under the impacts of climate change and land-use and cover change, the Yangtze River Basin faces a series of challenges in massive flooding/drought and eco-environmental health related problems. While the past few decades have witnessed the apparent deterioration of the Yangtze River ecosystem, the public has called for the restoration of ecosystem services and the promotion of sustainable socioeconomic development, which largely depends on water and ecosystem security. This overview addresses eco-water security and sustainable development in the Yangtze River basin under a changing environment. Looking forward to a healthy Yangtze River in the future, there are still uncertainties regarding how to assess and wisely manage the Yangtze River through a systematic, integrated approach applied to multiple dimensions, water, biodiversity, ecological services, and resilience, for the sustainable development of ecosystems and human beings. We designed the Yangtze Simulator, which is an integrated modelling system for the evaluation of eco-water security in the Yangtze River Basin powered by artificial intelligence and interdisciplinary science. The Yangtze Simulator will serve as a robust tool for good governance of the Yangtze River Basin.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;","",https://doi.org/10.5194/iahs2022-309,"",,
rayyan-224221602,Hydrological Evaluation of Meandering River Restoration in Kushiro Wetland Using a Long Short-Term Memory (Lstm)Based Model for Groundwater Level Prediction,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Wetland ecosystems with proper functioning provide various ecosystem services. Therefore, their conservation and restoration are of fundamental importance for sustainable development. This study used a deep learning model for groundwater level prediction to evaluate a wetland restoration project implemented in the Kushiro Wetland in Japan. The Kushiro Wetland had been degraded due to river improvement work. However, in 2010, a wetland restoration project was carried out to restore the meandering river channel, passing a decade. This study, at first, created a deep learning model that predicted the groundwater levels before and after the restoration of the meandering river channel using observation data. Long short-term memory (LSTM) was used as the deep learning model. The trained LSTM model achieved high performance with prediction error of the groundwater levels within 0.162 m at all observation points. Next, the trained LSTM models with observation data before and after the restoration were applied to evaluate the effectiveness of the meandering channel restoration. The results clarified that the meandering channel restoration regained hydrological processes in groundwater levels, i.e., their rainfall response and average water levels. In particular, the regaining tendency was remarkable at the observation points on the upstream side. Furthermore, the variable importance analysis of the explanatory variables in the LSTM model showed that river discharge and precipitation significantly contributed to groundwater level recovery in the Kushiro Wetland. These results indicated that the LSTM model was able to predict the groundwater level before and after the meandering channel restoration with high accuracy enough to evaluate its effect and factors in the Kushiro Wetland. Furthermore, since the LSTM was a data-driven deep learning model, it could be a powerful analytical method easily used in environmental management and conservation issues without special knowledge of groundwater hydrology.","",https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4293058,"",,
