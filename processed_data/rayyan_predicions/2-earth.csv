rayyan-220222405,ClimateNet: an expert-labelled open dataset and Deep Learning architecture for enabling high-precision analyses of extreme weather,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract. Identifying, detecting and localizing extreme weather events is a crucial first step in understanding how they may vary under different climate change scenarios. Pattern recognition tasks such as classification, object detection and segmentation have remained challenging problems in the weather and climate sciences. While there exist many empirical heuristics for detecting extreme events, the disparities between the output of these different methods even for a single event are large and often difficult to reconcile. Given the success of Deep Learning (DL) in tackling similar problems in computer vision, we advocate a DL-based approach. DL, however, works best in the context of supervised learning; when labeled datasets are readily available. Reliable, labeled training data for extreme weather and climate events is scarce. We create ClimateNet – an open, community-sourced human expert-labeled curated dataset – that captures tropical cyclones (TCs) and atmospheric rivers (ARs) in high-resolution climate model output from a simulation of a recent historical period. We use the curated ClimateNet dataset to train a state-of-the-art DL model for pixel-level identification, i.e. segmentation, of TCs and ARs. We then apply the trained DL model to historical and climate change scenarios simulated by the Community Atmospheric Model (CAM5.1) and show that the DL model accurately segments the data into TCs, ARs or the background at a pixel level. Further, we show how the segmentation results can be used to conduct spatially and temporally precise analytics by quantifying distributions of extreme precipitation conditioned on event types (TC or AR) at regional scales. The key contribution of this work is that it paves the way for DL-based automated, hi-fidelity and highly precise analytics of climate data using a curated expert-labelled dataset – ClimateNet. ClimateNet and the DL-based segmentation method provide several unique capabilities: (i) they can be used to calculate a variety of TC and AR statistics at a fine-grained level; (ii) they can be applied to different climate scenarios and different datasets without tuning as they do not rely on threshold conditions; and (iii) the proposed DL method is suitable for rapidly analyzing large amounts of climate model output. While our study has been conducted for two important extreme weather patterns (TCs and ARs) in simulation datasets, we believe that this methodology can be applied to a much broader class of patterns, and applied to observational and reanalysis data products via transfer learning.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-2020-72,"",,
rayyan-220222413,Machine Learning for Robust Identification of Complex Nonlinear Dynamical Systems: Applications to Earth Systems Modeling,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Systems exhibiting nonlinear dynamics, including but not limited to chaos, are ubiquitous across Earth Sciences such as Meteorology, Hydrology, Climate and Ecology, as well as Biology such as neural and cardiac processes. However, System Identification remains a challenge. In climate and earth systems models, while governing equations follow from first principles and understanding of key processes has steadily improved, the largest uncertainties are often caused by parameterizations such as cloud physics, which in turn have witnessed limited improvements over the last several decades. Climate scientists have pointed to Machine Learning enhanced parameter estimation as a possible solution, with proof-of-concept methodological adaptations being examined on idealized systems. While climate science has been highlighted as a ""Big Data"" challenge owing to the volume and complexity of archived model-simulations and observations from remote and in-situ sensors, the parameter estimation process is often relatively a ""small data"" problem. A crucial question for data scientists in this context is the relevance of state-of-the-art data-driven approaches including those based on deep neural networks or kernel-based processes. Here we consider a chaotic system - two-level Lorenz-96 - used as a benchmark model in the climate science literature, adopt a methodology based on Gaussian Processes for parameter estimation and compare the gains in predictive understanding with a suite of Deep Learning and strawman Linear Regression methods. Our results show that adaptations of kernel-based Gaussian Processes can outperform other approaches under small data constraints along with uncertainty quantification; and needs to be considered as a viable approach in climate science and earth system modeling.","",https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2008.05590,"",,
rayyan-220222445,Tree Cover Estimation in Global Drylands from Space Using Deep Learning,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Accurate tree cover mapping is of paramount importance in many fields, from biodiversity conservation to carbon stock estimation, ecohydrology, erosion control, or Earth system modelling. Despite this importance, there is still uncertainty about global forest cover, particularly in drylands. Recently, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) conducted a costly global assessment of dryland forest cover through the visual interpretation of orthoimages using the Collect Earth software, involving hundreds of operators from around the world. Our study proposes a new automatic method for estimating tree cover using artificial intelligence and free orthoimages. Our results show that our tree cover classification model, based on convolutional neural networks (CNN), is 23% more accurate than the manual visual interpretation used by FAO, reaching up to 79% overall accuracy. The smallest differences between the two methods occurred in the driest regions, but disagreement increased with the percentage of tree cover. The application of CNNs could be used to improve and reduce the cost of tree cover maps from the local to the global scale, with broad implications for research and management.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/rs12030343,"",,
rayyan-220222455,Monitoring Vegetation Change in the Presence of High Cloud Cover with Sentinel-2 in a Lowland Tropical Forest Region in Brazil,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Forests play major roles in climate regulation, ecosystem services, carbon storage, biodiversity, terrain stabilization, and water retention, as well as in the economy of numerous countries. Nevertheless, deforestation and forest degradation are rampant in many parts of the world. In particular, the Amazonian rainforest faces the constant threats posed by logging, mining, and burning for agricultural expansion. In Brazil, the “Sete de Setembro Indigenous Land”, a protected area located in a lowland tropical forest region at the border between the Mato Grosso and Rondônia states, is subject to illegal deforestation and therefore necessitates effective vegetation monitoring tools. Optical satellite imagery, while extensively used for landcover assessment and monitoring, is vulnerable to high cloud cover percentages, as these can preclude analysis and strongly limit the temporal resolution. We propose a cloud computing-based coupled detection strategy using (i) cloud and cloud shadow/vegetation detection systems with Sentinel-2 data analyzed on the Google Earth Engine with deep neural network classification models, with (ii) a classification error correction and vegetation loss and gain analysis tool that dynamically compares and updates the classification in a time series. The initial results demonstrate that such a detection system can constitute a powerful monitoring tool to assist in the prevention, early warning, and assessment of deforestation and forest degradation in cloudy tropical regions. Owing to the integrated cloud detection system, the temporal resolution is significantly improved. The limitations of the model in its present state include classification issues during the forest fire period, and a lack of distinction between natural vegetation loss and anthropogenic deforestation. Two possible solutions to the latter problem are proposed, namely, the mapping of known agricultural and bare areas and its subsequent removal from the analyzed data, or the inclusion of radar data, which would allow a large amount of finetuning of the detection processes.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/rs12111829,"",,
rayyan-220222463,Data Acquisition and Processing for GeoAI Models to Support Sustainable Agricultural Practices,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"There are growing opportunities to leverage new technologies and data sources to address global problems related to sustainability, climate change, and biodiversity loss. The emerging discipline of GeoAI resulting from the convergence of AI and Geospatial science (Geo-AI) is enabling the possibility to harness the increasingly available open Earth Observation data collected from different constellations of satellites and sensors with high spatial, spectral and temporal resolutions. However, transforming these raw data into high-quality datasets that could be used for training AI and specifically deep learning models are technically challenging. This paper describes the process and results of synthesizing labelled-datasets that could be used for training AI (specifically Convolutional Neural Networks) models for determining agricultural land use pattern to support decisions for sustainable farming. In our opinion, this work is a significant step forward in addressing the paucity of usable datasets for developing scalable GeoAI models for sustainable agriculture.","",https://doi.org/10.24251/hicss.2020.115,"",,
rayyan-220222482,EVALUATION OF SEMANTIC SEGMENTATION METHODS FOR DEFORESTATION DETECTION IN THE AMAZON,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract. Deforestation is a wide-reaching problem, responsible for serious environmental issues, such as biodiversity loss and global climate change. Containing approximately ten percent of all biomass on the planet and home to one tenth of the known species, the Amazon biome has faced important deforestation pressure in the last decades. Devising efficient deforestation detection methods is, therefore, key to combat illegal deforestation and to aid in the conception of public policies directed to promote sustainable development in the Amazon. In this work, we implement and evaluate a deforestation detection approach which is based on a Fully Convolutional, Deep Learning (DL) model: the DeepLabv3+. We compare the results obtained with the devised approach to those obtained with previously proposed DL-based methods (Early Fusion and Siamese Convolutional Network) using Landsat OLI-8 images acquired at different dates, covering a region of the Amazon forest. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the methods to the amount of training data, we also evaluate them using varying training sample set sizes. The results show that all tested variants of the proposed method significantly outperform the other DL-based methods in terms of overall accuracy and F1-score. The gains in performance were even more substantial when limited amounts of samples were used in training the evaluated methods.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/isprs-archives-xliii-b3-2020-1497-2020,"",,
rayyan-220222490,Historical Aerial Surveys Map Long-Term Changes of Forest Cover and Structure in the Central Congo Basin,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Given the impact of tropical forest disturbances on atmospheric carbon emissions, biodiversity, and ecosystem productivity, accurate long-term reporting of Land-Use and Land-Cover (LULC) change in the pre-satellite era (&lt;1972) is an imperative. Here, we used a combination of historical (1958) aerial photography and contemporary remote sensing data to map long-term changes in the extent and structure of the tropical forest surrounding Yangambi (DR Congo) in the central Congo Basin. Our study leveraged structure-from-motion and a convolutional neural network-based LULC classifier, using synthetic landscape-based image augmentation to map historical forest cover across a large orthomosaic (~93,431 ha) geo-referenced to ~4.7 ± 4.3 m at submeter resolution. A comparison with contemporary LULC data showed a shift from previously highly regular industrial deforestation of large areas to discrete smallholder farming clearing, increasing landscape fragmentation and providing opportunties for substantial forest regrowth. We estimated aboveground carbon gains through reforestation to range from 811 to 1592 Gg C, partially offsetting historical deforestation (2416 Gg C), in our study area. Efforts to quantify long-term canopy texture changes and their link to aboveground carbon had limited to no success. Our analysis provides methods and insights into key spatial and temporal patterns of deforestation and reforestation at a multi-decadal scale, providing a historical context for past and ongoing forest research in the area.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/rs12040638,"",,
rayyan-220222493,NASA NeMO-Net's Convolutional Neural Network: Mapping Marine Habitats with Spectrally Heterogeneous Remote Sensing Imagery,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Recent advances in machine learning and computer vision have enabled increased automation in benthic habitat mapping through airborne and satellite remote sensing. Here, we applied deep learning and neural network architectures in NASA NeMO-Net, a novel neural multimodal observation and training network for global habitat mapping of shallow benthic tropical marine systems. These ecosystems, particularly coral reefs, are undergoing rapid changes as a result of increasing ocean temperatures, acidification, and pollution, among other stressors. Remote sensing from air and space has been the primary method in which changes are assessed within these important, often remote, ecosystems at a global scale. However, such global datasets often suffer from large spectral variances due to the time of observation, atmospheric effects, water column properties, and heterogeneous instruments and calibrations. To address these challenges, we developed an object-based fully convolutional network (FCN) to improve upon the spatial-spectral classification problem inherent in multimodal datasets. We showed that with training upon augmented data in conjunction with classical methods, such as K-nearest neighbors, we were able to achieve better overall classification and segmentation results. This suggests FCNs are able to effectively identify the relative applicable spectral and spatial spaces within an image, whereas pixel-based classical methods excel at classification within those identified spaces. Our spectrally invariant results, based on minimally preprocessed WorldView-2 and Planet satellite imagery, show a total accuracy of approximately 85% and 80%, respectively, over nine classes when trained and tested upon a chain of Fijian islands imaged under highly variable day-to-day spectral inputs.","",https://doi.org/10.1109/jstars.2020.3018719,"",,
rayyan-220222508,Examining the effects of green revolution led agricultural expansion on net ecosystem service values in India using multiple valuation approaches,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Ecosystem Services (ESs) are bundles of natural processes and functions that are essential for human well-being, subsistence, and livelihoods. The 'Green Revolution' (GR) has substantial impact on the agricultural landscape and ESs in India. However, the effects of GR on ESs have not been adequately documented and analyzed. This leads to the main hypothesis of this work - 'the incremental trend of ESs in India is mainly prompted by GR led agricultural innovations that took place during 1960 - 1970'. The analysis was carried out through five successive steps. First, the spatiotemporal Ecosystem Service Values (ESVs) in Billion US$ for 1985, 1995, and 2005 were estimated using several value transfer approaches. Second, the sensitivity and elasticity of different ESs to land conversion were carried out using coefficient of sensitivity and coefficient of elasticity. Third, the Geographically Weighted Regression model was performed using five explanatory factors, i.e., total crop area, crop production, crop yield, net irrigated area, and cropping intensity, to explore the cumulative and individual effects of these driving factors on ESVs. Fourth, Multi-Layer Perceptron based Artificial Neural Network was employed to estimate the normalized importance of these explanatory factors. Fifth, simple and multiple linear regression modeling was done to assess the linear associations between the driving factors and the ESs. During the observation periods, cropland, forestland and water bodies contributed to 80%-90% of ESVs, followed by grassland, mangrove, wetland and urban built-up. In all three evaluation years, the highest estimated ESVs among the nine ES categories was provided by water regulation, followed by soil formation and soil-water retention, biodiversity maintenance, waste treatment, climate regulation, and greenhouse gas regulation. Among the five explanatory factors, total crop area, crop production, and net irrigated area showed strong positive associations with ESVs, while cropping intensity exhibited a negative association. Therefore, the study reveals a strong association between GR led agricultural expansion and ESVs in India. This study suggests that there should be an urgent need for formulation of rigorous ecosystem management strategies and policies to preserve ecological integrity and flow of uninterrupted ESs and to sustain human well-being.","",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2020.111381,"",,
rayyan-220222512,Identifying Soil Erosion Processes in Alpine Grasslands on Aerial Imagery with a U-Net Convolutional Neural Network,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Erosion in alpine grasslands is a major threat to ecosystem services of alpine soils. Natural causes for the occurrence of soil erosion are steep topography and prevailing climate conditions in combination with soil fragility. To increase our understanding of ongoing erosion processes and support sustainable land-use management, there is a need to acquire detailed information on spatial occurrence and temporal trends. Existing approaches to identify these trends are typically laborious, have lack of transferability to other regions, and are consequently only applicable to smaller regions. In order to overcome these limitations and create a sophisticated erosion monitoring tool capable of large-scale analysis, we developed a model based on U-Net, a fully convolutional neural network, to map different erosion processes on high-resolution aerial images (RGB, 0.25–0.5 m). U-Net was trained on a high-quality data set consisting of labeled erosion sites mapped with object-based image analysis (OBIA) for the Urseren Valley (Central Swiss Alps) for five aerial images (16 year period). We used the U-Net model to map the same study area and conduct quality assessments based on a held-out test region and a temporal transferability test on new images. Erosion classes are assigned according to their type (shallow landslide and sites with reduced vegetation affected by sheet erosion) or land-use impacts (livestock trails and larger management affected areas). We show that results obtained by OBIA and U-Net follow similar linear trends for the 16 year study period, exhibiting increases in total degraded area of 167% and 201%, respectively. Segmentations of eroded sites are generally in good agreement, but also display method-specific differences, which lead to an overall precision of 73%, a recall of 84%, and a F1-score of 78%. Our results show that U-Net is transferable to spatially (within our study area) and temporally unseen data (data from new years) and is therefore a method suitable to efficiently and successfully capture the temporal trends and spatial heterogeneity of degradation in alpine grasslands. Additionally, U-Net is a powerful and robust tool to map erosion sites in a predictive manner utilising large amounts of new aerial imagery.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/rs12244149,"",,
rayyan-220222521,Resistance of mound-building termites to anthropogenic land-use change,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract Humans pose a major threat to many species through land-use change in virtually every habitat. However, the extent of this threat is largely unknown for invertebrates due to challenges with investigating their distributions at large scales. This knowledge gap is particularly troublesome for soil macrofauna because of the critical roles many of these organisms perform as ecosystem engineers. We used a combination of high-resolution airborne Light Detection and Ranging and deep learning models to map the distribution of the ecologically important termite genus Macrotermes across a South African savanna land-use gradient, quantifying the effects of land-use change on patterns of mound densities, heights and spatial patterning. Despite significant anthropogenic alteration to landscapes, termite mounds persisted and shared a number of similarities to mounds in untransformed areas. Mean mound height was not substantially reduced in transformed landscapes, and over-dispersion of mounds at localized scales was conserved. However, mound densities were partially reduced, and height distributions in transformed areas differed to those in protected areas. Our findings suggest that mound-building termites persist even in areas of relatively high human disturbance, but also highlight important differences in termite distributions that could lead to reductions in ecosystem services provided by termites in human-modified landscapes. The persistence of at least half of mounds in human-modified landscapes could serve as starting points for savanna restoration.","",https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/aba0ff,"",,

Therefore, exploring land use/cover change is of great significance to urban planning and sustainable development. In this study, we preprocessed multiperiod land use and socioeconomic data, combined with spatial zoning, multilayer perception (MLP) artificial neural network, and Markov chain (MC), to construct a cellular automaton model of spatial zoning. Moreover, with the help of ArcGIS 10.2 and TerrSet 18.07 software, we explore the current status of land use and predict future changes. The results showed that drastic changes have occurred among different land use classes in Jinzhou District over the past 13 years owing to the impact of economic development and reclamation projects. Construction land, arable land, and waters have changed by +85.09, −24.42, and −23.62 km 2 , respectively. By comparing the FoM and Kappa coefficients, we concluded that the prediction accuracy of partitioned MLP-MC is better than that of unpartitioned MLP-MC. Therefore, using the spatial zoning approach to identify the conversion rules among land use classes in different zones can more effectively predict future land use changes and provide a reference for urban planning and policy making.","",https://doi.org/10.1155/2020/3547323,"",,
rayyan-220222596,Deep Learning with Open Data for Desert Road Mapping,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"The availability of free and open data from Earth observation programmes such as Copernicus, and from collaborative projects such as Open Street Map (OSM), enables low cost artificial intelligence (AI) based monitoring applications. This creates opportunities, particularly in developing countries with scarce economic resources, for large–scale monitoring in remote regions. A significant portion of Earth’s surface comprises desert dune fields, where shifting sand affects infrastructure and hinders movement. A robust, cost–effective and scalable methodology is proposed for road detection and monitoring in regions covered by desert sand. The technique uses Copernicus Sentinel–1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite data as an input to a deep learning model based on the U–Net architecture for image segmentation. OSM data is used for model training. The method comprises two steps: The first involves processing time series of Sentinel–1 SAR interferometric wide swath (IW) acquisitions in the same geometry to produce multitemporal backscatter and coherence averages. These are divided into patches and matched with masks of OSM roads to form the training data, the quantity of which is increased through data augmentation. The second step includes the U–Net deep learning workflow. The methodology has been applied to three different dune fields in Africa and Asia. A performance evaluation through the calculation of the Jaccard similarity coefficient was carried out for each area, and ranges from 84% to 89% for the best available input. The rank distance, calculated from the completeness and correctness percentages, was also calculated and ranged from 75% to 80%. Over all areas there are more missed detections than false positives. In some cases, this was due to mixed infrastructure in the same resolution cell of the input SAR data. Drift sand and dune migration covering infrastructure is a concern in many desert regions, and broken segments in the resulting road detections are sometimes due to sand burial. The results also show that, in most cases, the Sentinel–1 vertical transmit–vertical receive (VV) backscatter averages alone constitute the best input to the U–Net model. The detection and monitoring of roads in desert areas are key concerns, particularly given a growing population increasingly on the move.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/rs12142274,"",,
rayyan-220222600,Long-term satellite-based estimates of air quality and premature mortality in Equatorial Asia through deep neural networks,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Atmospheric pollution of particulate matter (PM) is a major concern for its deleterious effects on human health and climate. Over the past 50 years, Equatorial Asia has experienced significant land-use change and urbanization, which have contributed to more intense and frequent extreme PM concentrations associated with increased anthropogenic and wildfire emissions. Recent advances in remote sensing instrumentation and retrieval protocols have enabled effective monitoring of PM from space in near real time with almost global coverage. In this study, long-term satellite-based observations of key chemical and physical parameters, integrated with ground-based concentrations of PM with aerodynamic diameter <10 μm (PM10) measured at 52 stations, are used to develop a machine learning approach for continuous PM10 monitoring. As PM atmospheric pollution, like most of environmental processes, is highly non-linear and influenced by numerous variables, machine learning approaches seem very suitable. Herein, deep neural networks are developed and tested over different temporal scales and used to map PM10 over Equatorial Asia during the period 2005–2015. The proposed model captures both PM10 seasonal variability and the occurrence of extreme episodes, which are found to impact air quality on the regional scale. The modeled annual mean fine PM (PM2.5) concentrations are used to estimate long-term premature mortality. This study indicates that the region is experiencing increasing mortality rates related to long-term exposure to PM2.5, with 150 000 (108 000–193 000) premature deaths in 2005 and 204 000 (145 000–260 000) in 2015.

The classification of hyperspectral image (HSI) with high spectral and spatial resolution represents an important and challenging task in image processing and remote sensing (RS) domains due to the problem of computational complexity and big dimensionality of the remote sensing images. The spatial and spectral pixel characteristics have crucial significance for hyperspectral image classification and to take into account these two types of characteristics, various classification and feature extraction methods have been developed to improve spectral-spatial classification of remote sensing images for thematic mapping purposes such as agricultural mapping, urban mapping, emergency mapping in case of natural disasters... In recent years, mathematical morphology and deep learning (DL) have been recognized as prominent feature extraction techniques that led to remarkable spectral-spatial classification performances.

rayyan-220222731,DOMAIN ADAPTATION WITH CYCLEGAN FOR CHANGE DETECTION IN THE AMAZON FOREST,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract. Deep learning classification models require large amounts of labeled training data to perform properly, but the production of reference data for most Earth observation applications is a labor intensive, costly process. In that sense, transfer learning is an option to mitigate the demand for labeled data. In many remote sensing applications, however, the accuracy of a deep learning-based classification model trained with a specific dataset drops significantly when it is tested on a different dataset, even after fine-tuning. In general, this behavior can be credited to the domain shift phenomenon. In remote sensing applications, domain shift can be associated with changes in the environmental conditions during the acquisition of new data, variations of objects’ appearances, geographical variability and different sensor properties, among other aspects. In recent years, deep learning-based domain adaptation techniques have been used to alleviate the domain shift problem. Recent improvements in domain adaptation technology rely on techniques based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), such as the Cycle-Consistent Generative Adversarial Network (CycleGAN), which adapts images across different domains by learning nonlinear mapping functions between the domains. In this work, we exploit the CycleGAN approach for domain adaptation in a particular change detection application, namely, deforestation detection in the Amazon forest. Experimental results indicate that the proposed approach is capable of alleviating the effects associated with domain shift in the context of the target application.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/isprs-archives-xliii-b3-2020-1635-2020,"",,

As the climate changes and extreme weather events become more frequent, these methods must be resilient to changes in domain shifts that may occur, for example, due to shifts in planting timelines. In this work, we present an approach for within-season crop type classification using moderate spatial resolution (30 m) satellite data that addresses domain shift related to planting timelines by normalizing inputs by crop growth stage. We use a neural network leveraging both convolutional and recurrent layers to predict if a pixel contains corn, soybeans, or another crop or land cover type. We evaluated this method for the 2019 growing season in the midwestern US, during which planting was delayed by as much as 1-2 months due to extreme weather that caused record flooding. We show that our approach using growth stage-normalized time series outperforms fixed-date time series, and achieves overall classification accuracy of 85.4% prior to harvest (September-November) and 82.8% by mid-season (July-September).","",https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2009.10189,"",,
rayyan-220222751,Land use and land cover changes along the China-Myanmar Oil and Gas pipelines – Monitoring infrastructure development in remote conflict-prone regions,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Energy infrastructures can have negative impacts on the environment. In remote and / or sparsely populated as well as in conflict-prone regions, these can be difficult to assess, in particular when they are of a large scale. Analyzing land use and land cover changes can be an important initial step towards establishing the quantity and quality of impacts. Drawing from very-high-resolution-multi-temporal-satellite-imagery, this paper reports on a study which employed the Random Forest Classifier and Land Change Modeler to derive detailed information of the spatial patterns and temporal variations of land-use and land-cover changes resulting from the China-Myanmar Oil and Gas Pipelines in Ann township in Myanmar's Rakhine State of Myanmar. Deforestation and afforestation conversion processes during pre- and post-construction periods (2010 to 2012) are compared. Whilst substantial forest areas were lost along the pipelines, this is only part of the story, as afforestation has also happened in parallel. However, afforestation areas can be of a lower value, and in order to be able to take quality of forests into account, it is of crucial importance to accompany satellite-imagery based techniques with field observation. Findings have important implications for future infrastructure development projects in conflict-affected regions in Myanmar and elsewhere.","",https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0237806,"",,

Machine learning (ML) and data-driven approaches are increasingly used in many research areas. XGBoost is a tree boosting method that has evolved into a state-of-the-art approach for many ML challenges. However, it has rarely been used in simulations of land use change so far. Xilingol, a typical region for research on serious grassland degradation and its drivers, was selected as a case study to test whether XGBoost can provide alternative insights that conventional land-use models are unable to generate. A set of twenty drivers was analysed using XGBoost, involving four alternative sampling strategies, and SHAP to interpret the results of the purely data-driven approach. The results indicated that, with three of the sampling strategies (over-balanced, balanced and imbalanced), XGBoost achieved similar and robust simulation results. SHAP values were useful for analysing the complex relationship between the different drivers of grassland degradation. Four drivers accounted for 99 % of the grassland degradation dynamics in Xilingol. These four drivers were spatially allocated, and a risk map of further degradation was produced. The limitations of using XGBoost to predict future land-use change are discussed.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-2020-59,"",,

Bali has been open to tourism since the beginning of the 20th century and is known as the first tourist destination in Indonesia. The Denpasar, Badung, Gianyar, and Tabanan (Sarbagita) areas experience the most rapid growth of tourism activity in Bali. This rapid tourism growth has caused land use and land cover (LULC) to change drastically. This study mapped the land-use change in Bali from 2000 to 2025. The land change modeller (LCM) tool in ArcGIS was employed to conduct this analysis. The images were classified into agricultural land, open area, mangrove, vegetation/forest, and built-up area. Some Landsat images in 2000 and 2015 were exploited in predicting the land use and land cover (LULC) change in 2019 and 2025. To measure the accuracy of prediction, Landsat 8 OLI images for 2019 were classified and tested to verify the LULC model for 2019. The Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network was trained with two influencing factors: elevation and road network. The result showed that the built-up growth direction expanded from the Denpasar area to the neighbouring areas, and land was converted from agriculture, open area and vegetation/forest to built-up for all observation years. The built-up was predicted growing up to 43 % from 2015 to 2025. This model could support decision-makers in issuing a policy for monitoring LULC since the Kappa coefficients were more than 80% for all models.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/isprs-archives-xliii-b3-2020-1621-2020,"",,
rayyan-220222811,Regional wetland water storage changes: The influence of future climate on geographically isolated wetlands,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Geographically Isolated Wetlands (GIWs) are essential ecological and ecosystem entities that are vulnerable to climate change. The water storage volume (WSV) of GIWs is an important indicator to monitor their health and ecosystem services. Therefore, the projection of changes in future WSV of GIWs is crucial for conservation policies that are typically set at the regional scale. A limiting factor for the extended spatial projection of WSV of GIWs is the lack of data on their geometry, bathymetry, and the complexity of hydrologic relation to the surrounding drainage basin and the climate at a regional scale. In this study, we developed a hybrid Machine Learning (ML) – hydrologic modelling approach, from which a number of indices and variables derived to assess WSV of GIWs. We projected future changes in WSV of about a hundred thousand GIWs across 17 large river basins in western Canada, using a nine-model ensemble climate simulations under two greenhouse gas emissions scenarios (i.e., RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5). We estimated the baseline WSV by developing ML models using water depth measurements and geographical information features from 234 surveyed GIWs across the study area. Future WSV was quantified using a three-step procedure, where water balance simulations were facilitated through the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) for the 2018–2034 period, and GIW specific mass-balance components were adapted using remote sensing data. The spatiotemporal analysis of the WSV offers new insights, and reveals (1) a baseline provincial WSV of 550 million m3, with an average of 5,508 m3 per GIW, (2) a decreasing future WSV at annual rates of −2.58 and −2.62 million m3 for RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5, respectively, and (3) the minimum and maximum WSV loss rates occurring during October and February, respectively, and (4) a diverse trend and magnitude of changes in WSV across 17 river basins. Finally, we state that while a group of hydrologic, climatic, and geographic processes and factors drives WSV of GIWs, the dominating driving force in WSV trends might be spatially and temporally different depending on the environmental conditions and characteristics of river basins and their associated GIWs. This study facilitates a better understanding of the connections between the WSV of GIWs and watershed-scale hydrology and climate change across multiple spatial scales.","",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2020.106941,"",,
rayyan-220222838,Fully reversible neural networks for large-scale surface and sub-surface characterization via remote sensing,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"The large spatial/frequency scale of hyperspectral and airborne magnetic and gravitational data causes memory issues when using convolutional neural networks for (sub-) surface characterization. Recently developed fully reversible networks can mostly avoid memory limitations by virtue of having a low and fixed memory requirement for storing network states, as opposed to the typical linear memory growth with depth. Fully reversible networks enable the training of deep neural networks that take in entire data volumes, and create semantic segmentations in one go. This approach avoids the need to work in small patches or map a data patch to the class of just the central pixel. The cross-entropy loss function requires small modifications to work in conjunction with a fully reversible network and learn from sparsely sampled labels without ever seeing fully labeled ground truth. We show examples from land-use change detection from hyperspectral time-lapse data, and regional aquifer mapping from airborne geophysical and geological data.","",https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2003.07474,"",,

However, soybean-growing areas across Europe have been rapidly increasing in response to a rising demand for locally-produced, non-GM soybean in recent years. This raises questions about the suitability of European agro-climatic conditions for soybean production. We used data-driven relationships between climate and soybean yield derived from machine-learning techniques to make yield projections under current and future climate with moderate (RCP 4.5) to intense (RCP 8.5) warming, up to the 2050s and 2090s time horizons. Results suggest that a self-sufficiency level of 50% (100%) would be achievable in Europe under historical and future climate if 4-5% (9-12%) of the current European cropland is dedicated to soybean production. The associated increase in soybean area in Europe would bring environmental benefits, with a potential decrease of nitrogen fertilizer use in Europe by 5-8% (13-18%) and a possible reduction of deforestation in biodiversity hotspots in South America. However, it would also lead to an important reduction in the production of other cultivated species in Europe (e.g. cereals) and a potential increase in the use of irrigation water.","",https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.08.331496,"",,

Rapid loss, degradation and fragmentation of these native ecosystems in a changing climate have driven a time‐sensitive need to improve our understanding and management of remaining dry forests. We used advanced remote sensing technologies, combined with extensive field data and machine learning, to better understand how spatial drivers (e.g. climate, fire, human) of canopy species composition vary in importance and correlate with forest cover (total, native and non‐native), within an endangered Hawaiian tropical dry forest. Past introductions of non‐native, drought‐tolerant tree species into this Hawaiian dry forest have created a new forest canopy composition and a loss of native forest biodiversity and connectivity at the landscape scale. Synthesis and applications . Our findings help to spatially visualize the loss and transition of native Hawaiian forests and provide a new conservation planning tool. Conservation and restoration efforts can now be informed by spatial maps of canopy composition, connectivity and determinants of forest cover for the region. For example, our models identified a climatic transition zone between 800 and 1,000 m where native forests exist in high densities, and non‐native forests are not yet dominant. This area may be optimal for cost‐effective conservation and targeted management. Ecosystems are changing globally at unprecedented rates. The methods presented in this study provide a framework that can be adapted to monitor these changes around the world.","",https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2664.13632,"",,

Information on individual trees is important for understanding the state of forest ecosystems but obtaining individual-level data at broad scales is challenging due to the costs and logistics of data collection. While advances in remote sensing techniques allow surveys of individual trees at unprecedented extents, there remain significant technical and computational challenges in turning sensor data into tangible information. Using deep learning methods, we produced an open-source dataset of individual-level crown estimates for 100 million trees at 37 sites across the United States surveyed by the National Ecological Observatory Network’s Airborne Observation Platform. Each canopy tree crown is represented by a rectangular bounding box and includes information on the height, crown area, and spatial location of the tree. Tree crowns identified using this technique correspond well with hand-labeled crowns, exhibiting both high levels of overlap and good correspondence in height estimates. These data have the potential to drive significant expansion of individual-level research on trees by facilitating both regional analyses at scales of ~10,000 ha and cross-region comparisons encompassing forest types from most of the United States.","",https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.08.287839,"",,
rayyan-220222988,Habitat sampler—A sampling algorithm for habitat type delineation in remote sensing imagery,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract Aim The management of habitats for the conservation and restoration of biodiversity in protected area networks requires an appropriate monitoring to increase our understanding of processes and dynamics in managed ecosystems. Remote sensing offers a unique potential for the derivation of coherent spatiotemporal information to report on natural or management‐induced habitat change. However, the methods used for the delineation of habitat types in remote sensing imagery depend on the extensive process of ground truth sampling as reference to construct image classifiers. In fact, the number of required reference samples is intrinsically unknown in complex scenes due to the heterogeneity of varying habitat conditions. Thus, most classifiers are not transferable in retrospective image analysis or between different ecosystems that is, however, required for an operational use of remote sensing‐based monitoring systems. Innovation A new procedure is introduced that autonomously generates representative reference samples for a predictive modelling of habitat type probabilities. The procedure, termed Habitat Sampler, is provided as a tool that can be applied to any image input that display vegetation structures and dynamics on multiple temporal and spatial scales. The Habitat Sampler provides many labelled point locations for the training of image classifiers and enables a fast and easy to implement model transfer for the delineation of habitat dynamics in various ecosystems. Main conclusions The Habitat Sampler outperforms standard machine learning classifiers when the distribution of reference samples is unknown or insufficient. It was shown that particularly in retrospective image analyses patterns of successional and cyclic habitat development can be mapped for large heathland areas. The procedure is feasible for application in biodiversity conservation monitoring using various habitat typologies that are associated over ecosystem processes, particularly to report on protected area networks using cost‐free satellite imagery.","",https://doi.org/10.1111/ddi.13165,"",,

Up to now, the process of creating the human footprint index has required significant data and modeling, and updated versions of the index often lag the present day by many years. Here we introduce a near-present, global-scale machine learning-based human footprint index (ml-HFI) which is capable of routine update using satellite imagery alone. We present the most up-to-date map of the human footprint index, and document changes in human pressure during the past 20 years (2000 to 2019). Moreover, we demonstrate its utility as a monitoring tool for the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 15 (SDG15), “Life on Land”, which aims to foster sustainable development while conserving biodiversity. We identify 43 countries that are making progress toward SDG15 while also experiencing increases in their ml-HFI. We examine a subset of these in the context of conservation policies that may or may not enable continued progress toward SDG15. This has immediate policy relevance, since the majority of countries globally are not on track to achieve Goal 15 by the declared deadline of 2030. Moving forward, the ml-HFI may be used for ongoing monitoring and evaluation support toward the twin goals of fostering a thriving society and global Earth system.","",https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.06.284414,"",,
rayyan-220223116,Understanding Intraspecific Trait Variability Using Digital Herbarium Specimen Images,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Plant traits are vital to quantify, understand and predict plant and vegetation ecology, including responses to environmental and climate change. Leaf traits are among the best sampled, with more than 200,000 records for individual traits. Nevertheless, their coverage is still strongly limited, especially with respect to characterizing variation within species and across longer time scales. However, to date, more than 3000 herbaria worldwide have collected 390 million plant specimens, dating from the 16th century. At present, the herbarium specimens are rapidly digitized and the images are made openly available to facilitate research and biodiversity conservation. In this study, we determined the potential of the digitized herbarium specimens images to: overcome limitations of data availability for quantitative leaf traits such as the area, length, width along with petiole length and use the trait values to understand the intraspecific variability across spatio-temporal scales. overcome limitations of data availability for quantitative leaf traits such as the area, length, width along with petiole length and use the trait values to understand the intraspecific variability across spatio-temporal scales. For the study, initially, specimen metadata was analysed from various online resources such as the Global Plants Database, Natural History Museum Paris, iDigBio and Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF). Based on the completeness of the metadata, image availability, and the ease of measuring the leaf traits, we selected Salix bebbiana, Alnus incana, Viola canina, Salix glauca, Impatiens capensis, Chenopodium album , and Solanum dulcamara for the study. The semi-automated tool TraitEx (Gaikwad et al. 2019) was used to measure quantitative leaf traits such as the leaf area, perimeter, width, length and petiole length. Finally, excluding duplicates, we downloaded 17383 digital herbarium specimen images from iDigBio and GBIF, which included specimens from the 17th century to the present. However, about 5000 had insufficient information or quality issues, including not-yet-identified duplicates, or no intact leaves. For each selected image we measured four leaf traits - area, length, width and perimeter of the leaf blade - on up to 5 leaves. In sum, we collected about 120,000 trait records from 32009 leaves. Comparison of measured leaf traits to data from the TRY Plant Trait database (Kattge et al. 2019) revealed that we could improve the database for studying intraspecific trait variability by several orders of magnitude (from less than 10-100 records per species to &amp;gt;1000). The variation of trait records within the seven species shows reasonable patterns, which improves trust in the data quality. The extracted trait measurements were used to analyse the intraspecific variability for the species across different spatio-temporal resolutions. Machine learning method (random forest) was used to perform the analysis and the results revealed the imprint of spatial and temporal climate variation, including long term trends and climate change as well as seasonality effects, on leaf area. Through this study, we demonstrate the high benefits of digitizing herbarium specimens and reusing it for research studies to improve ecological knowledge and predictability of size-related leaf traits.","",https://doi.org/10.3897/biss.4.59061,"",,

China has witnessed extensive development of the marine aquaculture industry over recent years. However, such rapid and disordered expansion posed risks to coastal environment, economic development, and biodiversity protection. This study aimed to produce an accurate national-scale marine aquaculture map at a spatial resolution of 16 m, using a proposed deep convolution neural networks (CNNs) based model and applied it to satellite data from China's GF-1 sensor in an end-to-end way. The analyses used homogeneous CNNs to extract high-dimensional features from the input imagery and preserve information at full resolution. Then, a hierarchical cascade architecture was followed to capture multi-scale features and contextual information. This hierarchical cascade homogeneous neural network (HCHNet) was found to achieve better classification performance than current state-of-the-art models (FCN-32s, Deeplab V2, U-Net, and HCNet). The resulting marine aquaculture area map has an overall classification accuracy &gt; 95 % (95.2 %–96.4, 95 % confidence interval). And marine aquaculture was found to cover a total area of ~1100 km2 (1096.8 km2–1110.6 km2, 95 % confidence interval) in China, of which more than 85 % are marine plant culture areas, with 87 % found in the Fujian, Shandong, Liaoning, and Jiangsu provinces. The results confirm the applicability and effectiveness of HCHNet when applied to GF-1 data, identifying notable spatial distributions of different marine aquaculture areas and supporting the sustainable management and ecological assessments of coastal resources at a national scale.

Automatic satellite imagery analysis can significantly accelerate the process of tree type classification, which is traditionally carried out by ground-based observation. Although computer vision methods have proven their efficiency in remote sensing tasks, specific challenges arise in forestry applications. In this paper, we aim to improve tree species classification based on a neural network approach. We consider four species commonly found in Russian boreal forests: birch, aspen, pine, and spruce. We use imagery from the Sentinel-2 satellite, which has multiple bands (in the visible and infrared spectra) and a spatial resolution of up to 10 meters. Additionally, the short revisit time and free access policy make Sentinel-2 imagery a valuable data source for the purpose of forest classification. In computer vision terms, we define the problem of tree type classification as one of semantic segmentation, assigning a particular tree type to each pixel of the image. The forest inventory data contain tree type composition, but do not describe their spatial distribution within each individual stand. Therefore, some pixels can be assigned a wrong label if we consider each stand to be homogeneously populated by its dominant species. This calls for the use of a weakly supervised learning approach. To solve this problem, we use a deep convolutional neural network with a tailored loss function. We test the proposed models by creating a dataset of images for Leningrad Oblast of Russia. In our study, we demonstrate how to modify the training strategy, such that it can outperform basic per pixel neural network approaches.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/iecf2020-08035,"",,

Seasonal weather forecasts currently operate at the mesoscale (&gt; 1 km). For more targeted mitigation and adaptation, modelling impacts to &lt; 100 m is needed. Yet, the relationship between driving variables and Earth's surface at such local scales remains unresolved by current physical models. Large Earth observation datasets now enable us to create machine learning models capable of translating coarse weather information into high-resolution Earth surface forecasts. Here, we define high-resolution Earth surface forecasting as video prediction of satellite imagery conditional on mesoscale weather forecasts. Video prediction has been tackled with deep learning models. Developing such models requires analysis-ready datasets. We introduce EarthNet2021, a new, curated dataset containing target spatio-temporal Sentinel 2 satellite imagery at 20 m resolution, matched with high-resolution topography and mesoscale (1.28 km) weather variables. With over 32000 samples it is suitable for training deep neural networks. Comparing multiple Earth surface forecasts is not trivial. Hence, we define the EarthNetScore, a novel ranking criterion for models forecasting Earth surface reflectance. For model intercomparison we frame EarthNet2021 as a challenge with four tracks based on different test sets. These allow evaluation of model validity and robustness as well as model applicability to extreme events and the complete annual vegetation cycle. In addition to forecasting directly observable weather impacts through satellite-derived vegetation indices, capable Earth surface models will enable downstream applications such as crop yield prediction, forest health assessments, coastline management, or biodiversity monitoring.

It is more important than ever to develop methods which can monitor the impact we are having on the biodiversity of our planet. To influence policy changes in wildlife and resource management practices we need to provide measurable evidence of how we are affecting animal health and fitness and the ecosystems needed for their survival. We also need to pool our resources and work in interdisciplinary teams to find common threads which can help preserve biodiversity and vital habitats. This dissertation showcases how improved molecular biology assays and data analysis approaches can help monitor the fitness of animal populations within changing ecosystems. Chapter 1 details the development of a universal telomere assay for vertebrates. Recent work has shown the utility of telomere assays in tracking animal health. Telomere lengths can predict extinction events in animal populations, life span, and fitness consequences of anthropogenic activity. Telomere length assays are an improvement over other methods of measuring animal stress, such as cortisol levels, since they are stable during capture and sampling of animals. This dissertation provides a telomere length assay which can be used for any vertebrate. The assay was developed using a quantitative polymerase chain reaction platform which requires low DNA input and is rapid. This dissertation also demonstrates how this assay improves on current telomere assays developed for mice and can be used in a vertebrate not previously assayed for telomere lengths, the American kestrel. This work has the potential to propel research in vertebrate systems forward as it alleviates the need to develop new reference primers for each species of interest. This improved assay has shown promise in studies in mouse cell line studies, American kestrels, golden eagles, five species of passerine birds, osprey, northern goshawks and bighorn sheep.

Topic models were applied to understand community organization across a range of distinct, but connected, biological scales within the sagebrush steppe. The sagebrush steppe is home to several threatened species, including the pygmy rabbit (<italic>Brachylagus idahoensis</italic>) and sage-grouse (<italic>Centrocercus urophasianus</italic>). It covers vast swaths of the western United States and is subject to habitat fragmentation and land use conversion for both farming and rangeland use. It is also threatened by increases in fire events which can dramatically alter the landscape. Restoration efforts have been hampered by a lack of resources and often by inadequate collaboration between stakeholders and scientists. This work brought together scientists from four disciplines: remote sensing, field ecology, metabolomics and metagenomics, to provide a framework for how studies can be designed and analyzed that integrate patterns of biodiversity from multiple scales, from the molecular to the landscape scale. A topic model approach was used which groups features (chemicals, bacterial and plant taxa, and light spectrum) into “communities” which in turn can be analyzed for their presence within individual samples and time points. Within the landscape, I found communities which contain encroaching plant species, such as juniper (<italic>Juniperus</italic> spp.) and cheatgrass (<italic>Bromus tectorum</italic>). Within plants, I found chemicals which are known toxins to herbivores. Within herbivores, I identified differences in bacterial taxonomical communities associated with changes in diet. This work will help to inform restoration efforts and provide a road map for designing interdisciplinary studies.","",https://doi.org/10.18122/td/1705/boisestate,"",,
rayyan-220223328,TRU-NET: A Deep Learning Approach to High Resolution Prediction of Rainfall,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Climate models (CM) are used to evaluate the impact of climate change on the risk of floods and strong precipitation events. However, these numerical simulators have difficulties representing precipitation events accurately, mainly due to limited spatial resolution when simulating multi-scale dynamics in the atmosphere. To improve the prediction of high resolution precipitation we apply a Deep Learning (DL) approach using an input of CM simulations of the model fields (weather variables) that are more predictable than local precipitation. To this end, we present TRU-NET (Temporal Recurrent U-Net), an encoder-decoder model featuring a novel 2D cross attention mechanism between contiguous convolutional-recurrent layers to effectively model multi-scale spatio-temporal weather processes. We use a conditional-continuous loss function to capture the zero-skewed %extreme event patterns of rainfall. Experiments show that our model consistently attains lower RMSE and MAE scores than a DL model prevalent in short term precipitation prediction and improves upon the rainfall predictions of a state-of-the-art dynamical weather model. Moreover, by evaluating the performance of our model under various, training and testing, data formulation strategies, we show that there is enough data for our deep learning approach to output robust, high-quality results across seasons and varying regions.","",https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2008.09090,"",,

History of introduction and spread Ambrosia trifida is native to North America where the species is recorded as being weedy in many states (USDA, 2020). In North America, A. trifida seems to prefer establishment at latitudes between 45° and 30° north because of fairly strict photoperiodic constraints for flowering, which may maximize its reproduction (Allard, 1943). A. trifida was introduced into the EPPO region at the end of the 19th century, and it has expanded its range since the mid-1900s (Moser & Essl, 2013; Chauvel et al., 2015). Many of the occurrences of A. trifida in the EPPO region are considered casual populations. There are, however, well-established populations in western Europe, with high densities in south-west France (Chauvel et al., 2015). It is also considered established in a large part of Italy. In Japan, the first record was in 1952 from the Shizuoka Prefecture (Honshu) and now A. trifida occurs in almost the entire country. In South Korea, A. trifida was first recorded in the Seoul metropolitan area during the 1970s and it is now widely naturalized in the country (Kim, 2017). Qin et al. (2014) detail that A. trifida was introduced into China in 1935 from North America. For China, the literature reports differences in the number of provinces where A. trifida occurs, for example Xu et al. (2012) list five and Wan et al. (2012) lists 12. Morphology Plant type Annual herbaceous. Description A. trifida has large leaves (4-15 cm long). They are oppositely arranged, simple and palmately lobed, generally with three lobes (they may also have five lobes or be unlobed). The upper leaves can be alternate. They are borne on a long petiole (3–12 cm). Male and female flowers are separated on the same individual (monoecious plant). The inflorescences are long terminal clusters (30 cm) consisting of florets of male flowers. The female flowers are grouped into florets at the base of the male clusters and sometimes in the axils of the upper leaves. The fruit is a cup-shaped cypsela, tipped with a long central beak surrounded by a crown of approximately five or more shorter tips. It measures from 0.5 to 1.2 cm long and from 0.3 to 0.5 cm wide. A. trifida is characterized by enormous variability in the size and shape of its seeds, which may correspond to an ability to germinate in a variety of conditions (Harrison et al., 2007; Hovick et al., 2018; Fig. 1). Fig. 1Open in figure viewerPowerPoint A. trifida flower (EPPO Global Database, courtesy: Swen Follak). Biology and ecology General A. trifida has a comparatively low fecundity (compared to other Ambrosia species), transient seed-bank characteristics and a high percentage of non-viable seeds (Harrison et al., 2001, 2007). Goplen et al. (2016) detail that plants produced an average of 1800 seeds per plant in soybean and field margins, with 66% being potentially viable. The majority (90% or more) of A. trifida seeds buried 10 cm or less lost viability after 4 years (Stoller & Wax, 1974; Harrison et al., 2007); however, some seeds remained viable for 9 to 21 years when buried 20 cm or deeper (Toole & Brown, 1946; Harrison et al., 2007). Because of their high nutritional value, the seeds are often eaten by animals (e.g. birds and rodents), causing high losses (Harrison et al., 2003). It should be noted that A. trifida only reproduces by seed and not vegetatively. Within the EPPO region and the native range, seedlings typically emerge early in the growing season (e.g. March) and over a prolonged period (March until the end of July; Regnier et al., 2016). Flowering occurs in response to shortening day length and begins in the male inflorescences (Allard, 1943). In the native range (North America), A. trifida flowers from mid-June to the end of August, or even early September (Bassett & Crompton, 1982). The species can flower 2–3 weeks earlier than A. artemisiifolia. In south-west France, the flowering dates observed are similar to those in its area of origin (B. Chauvel, pers. comm., 2019). Habitats In North America, A. trifida grows in different types of herbaceous communities, including ruderal habitats such as railroad embankments, roadsides and cultivated fields, on rather rich and moist soil (Bassett & Crompton, 1982; Hartnett et al., 1987; Krippel & Colling, 2006; Regnier et al., 2016). It is also found in damp natural environments, particularly on riverbanks and floodplains as well as managed moist environments such as the banks of irrigation ditches and waterways (Sickels & Simpson, 1985; Regnier et al., 2016). In Japan, A. trifida can be found predominantly along riverbanks, mostly in disturbed locations (artificial banks, bridges and quarries) but also in the riverine vegetation (Miyawaki & Washitani, 2004). In South Korea, it occurs in the riparian systems of streams and rivers and around agricultural fields, on road edges and landfill sites and, recently, it has also invaded forest edges and interiors (Lee et al., 2010). In Japan and South Korea, A. trifida grows also in semi-natural areas (Miyawaki & Washitani, 2004; Lee et al., 2010). Suitable habitats occur for the establishment of A. trifida in the EPPO region. It currently occupies different environments: agricultural land (Rydlo et al., 2011), the banks of major water courses such as the Rhine and the Elbe, the banks of streams or canals (Jehlík & Hejný, 1974), road networks and other disturbed environments (e.g. abandoned industrial sites), as well as green urban areas (gardens; Moser & Essl, 2013). For A. trifida, most natural habitats of high conservation value are unsuitable, and thus negative effects of this plant on biodiversity are considered to be of low importance. Nevertheless, some data are available on A. trifida showing that it is able to invade natural riverside vegetation. There are no data for negative impacts of the species on rivers, especially for where it occurs in the Po Valley (Italy) in the EPPO region. In Central and Eastern Europe, A. trifida mainly occupies ruderal habitats including railway tracks and cultivated fields (Rydlo et al., 2011). According to Stoyanov et al. (2014), A. trifida may be established around Robinia pseudoacacia bushes close to the railway at the exit of the town of Dalgopol (Bulgaria). In Western Europe (France), the species only occupies cultivated fields. Environmental requirements A. trifida is not well adapted to drought, and it is not recorded in areas with a long summer drought unless there is irrigation (Allard, 1943; Regnier et al., 2016). Establishment is favoured by moist environments. A. trifida can tolerate a wide variety of soil types (Regnier et al., 2016). Seeds germinate under a wide range of temperatures with an optimum germination between 10 and 24°C (Abul-Fatih & Bazzaz, 1979). The seedlings can develop quickly within 4 to 13 days (Abul-Fatih & Bazzaz, 1979). A. trifida can emerge over a long period of time (March to June/July). In France, it emerges together with spring crops or a few days after crop emergence. Soybean is seeded in May in France. In south-west France, germination and emergence can begin as early as the end of March and continue later until the end of summer, especially in irrigated fields (Mamarot & Rodriguez, 2014). A. trifida has high photosynthetic ability compared to most annual species (Barnett & Steckel, 2013). It is damaged (i.e. damage to the foliage), but not killed by moderate frost. In North America, there is variation in A. trifida plant traits at both large and small geographic scales. Populations in the western USA corn belt had nearly four times greater fecundity and a 50% greater allocation to reproduction than populations in the eastern USA corn belt (Hovick et al., 2018). In addition, seedling emergence patterns differ among populations in agricultural fields (Sprague et al., 2004; Schutte et al., 2006, 2008). For example, the latter author showed that seeds which were from Iowa (western USA corn belt) produced seedlings in a rapid flush during early April, whereas seeds from Illinois and Ohio (eastern USA corn belt) produced seedlings in a more gradual flush that extended into late July. Seedling emergence patterns also differ between agricultural and non-agricultural environments. Populations from agricultural habitats exhibited a more prolonged emergence pattern than those from riparian, early successional, railroad siding or forest border habitats (Schutte et al., 2012; Hovick et al., 2018). Natural enemies There are no known natural enemies in the EPPO region. Uses and benefits There are no known uses and benefits of A. trifida for the EPPO region. Pathways for movement Globally, there have been numerous interceptions of A. trifida as a contaminant of seed or as a contaminant of grain (Shamonin & Smetnik, 1986). A. trifida has been introduced in Europe with imports of animal feed and seed. There are documented cases of the introduction of A. trifida into the EPPO region (Europe) via seed from crops imported from North America (Moser & Essl, 2013; Chauvel et al., 2015). This includes contamination of spring wheat seed for planting (Moser & Essl, 2013), soybean seed (Chauvel et al., 2015), maize seed (Stoyanov et al., 2014; Chauvel et al., 2015; COSAVE, 2019) and seed of other spring crops (sunflower, sorghum; G. Fried, pers. comm., 2019). Impact Effects on plants A. trifida is highly competitive and can form annual monospecific stands in ruderal habitats, forest borders, grassland habitats and riparian habitats (Sickels & Simpson, 1985; Regnier et al., 2016). In agricultural environments, the plant's significant and rapid development gives it a strong ability to enter into competition with different summer crops: soybean, cotton and maize. Even at very low densities (one plant per 25 m2), loss of crop yield (of around 5%) has been shown, a phenomenon rarely observed for other weeds (Harrison et al., 2001). Yield reductions of 13–50% have been observed in crop situations, with the losses being greatest when the crop and the weed grow simultaneously (Harrison et al., 2001; Barnett & Steckel, 2013). In North America, complete crop losses have been reported due to the presence of A. trifida (E. Regnier, pers. comm., 2019). In 1994, Webster et al. (1994) estimated the loss of yield in the USA associated with A. trifida in soybeans to be 5–7% of the yield of the crop. A recent study (Regnier et al., 2016) among farmers in the USA showed that A. trifida was the most difficult weed to manage for 45% of them, while 57% also reported a problem of herbicide resistance, either to acetolactate synthase (ALS) inhibitors or glyphosate (or resistance to both). In Northeast China, A. trifida is considered one of the weeds that causes the most economic damage to wheat and other annual crops. It was found that the plant and its residues have allelopathic effects that reduce wheat growth (Kong et al., 2007). In Europe, it is not currently possible to quantify the economic impacts of this species. In France, in the region of Toulouse, farmers report additional costs associated with hand weeding, and even the destruction of plots before harvesting due to very high densities of plants, meaning the total loss of the crop (A. Rodriguez, pers. comm., 2017). These costs (from a few hundred euros to a few thousand euros per hectare) have not yet been studied to a precise enough degree. At the national level, given the limited distribution of the species and the highly localized nature of the existing populations in the EPPO region (Moser & Essl, 2013; Chauvel et al., 2015), the costs in terms of health or losses of agricultural yields attributable to this species are negligible so far. Any action targeting control of this species will generate additional production costs (cost of weeding practices, establishment of less profitable crops or fallow). In the absence of plant health regulations relating to the control of introduction into the EPPO region of seed lots of maize, soybeans, sorghum and sunflower, the risk of introduction of herbicide-resistant genotypes of A. trifida appears high and such an introduction would result in a very high increase in control costs based on the studies carried out in the USA (Ganieet al., 2017). In annual summer crops where it is present, A. trifida is managed like other weeds without it being subject to additional control measures. Note, however, the arrival on the European market of sunflower varieties tolerant to herbicides intended to control species of the genus Ambrosia (and Asteraceae more generally). These varieties, through their tolerance to two herbicides from the class of ALS inhibitors, enable weed control in a post-emergence situation; they were placed on sale in 2010 to improve the post-emergence weed control of sunflower crops in general and more specifically against A. artemisiifolia. These new varieties make it easier to manage the recent problems with A. trifida. However, the repeated use of such varieties and the associated herbicides risks causing the significant and rapid selection of populations of A. trifida resistant to these active ingredients in the PRA area, as is currently occurring with A. artemisiifolia (Chauvel & Gard, 2010). An additional problem is the emerging resistance of A. trifida to glyphosate and ALS-inhibiting herbicides (Norsworthy et al., 2011; Regnier et al., 2016), thus further decreasing the possible avenues for its control, both in agriculture and ruderal areas, such as railways, roadsides etc. Based on the results of studies conducted in the USA (Ganie et al., 2017) in 2013 and 2014, the absence of management measures against this species resulted in a total loss of maize yield, even at low weed densities. These results suggest the same level of impact in the PRA area if no control measures are implemented against A. trifida. Without the implementation of integrated control against this species – effective chemical weed control, rotation including winter crops and appropriate tillage – the negative effects of A. trifida will probably increase, as suggested by the situation with certain plots in south-west France. However, until now, no published information has been available to quantify the negative effects of A. trifida in the PRA area. Some countries, such as Russia, Israel and Egypt, refuse imports of cereals contaminated by species of the genus Ambrosia. A. trifida is not mature when winter cereals are harvested in Europe and will not directly contaminate these crops. On the other hand, it is mature at the time of harvesting summer crops (maize, soybean, sunflower and sorghum). Contamination of these crops could prevent their export. As an example, in 2015 the maize export sector from the EU accounted for more than 63 million tonnes (EUROSTAT, 2019). There is a great risk of the additional costs of weed control and/or post-harvest sorting being reflected in market losses due to a higher production cost compared with situations free from A. trifida (Fig. 2). Fig. 2Open in figure viewerPowerPoint A. trifida invading a wheat crop in Russia (EPPO Global Database, courtesy: Swen Follak). Environmental and social impact For A. trifida, most natural habitats of high conservation value have a low potential to be invaded as they have low levels of disturbance, and thus the negative effects of this plant on biodiversity are considered to be of low importance. Nevertheless, some data are available on A. trifida showing that it is able to invade natural riverside vegetation. There are no data for negative impacts of the species on rivers, especially for where it occurs in the Po Valley (Italy) in the EPPO region. However, there is some anecdotal evidence that the species may have impacts on biodiversity from online forums (e.g. Acta Plantarum, an Italian forum for botanists: https://www.floraitaliae.actaplantarum.org) where comments include that the species has increased from 1 to 100 plants in one year. In Japan, a study on the floral diversity of infested river banks highlighted a decrease in diversity as a function of the density of A. trifida (Washitani, 2001). Miyawaki and Washitani (1996) found that plant species diversity was negatively correlated with the abundance of A. trifida in a nature reserve of moist tall grasslands along the Arakawa River, near Tokyo/Japan. Lee et al. (2010) demonstrated that the vegetation dominated by A. trifida in South Korea differed with regard to the composition and diversity of the species to that of the uninvaded riparian vegetation. There is limited data on the impact of the species on habitats, except those on the problems of rehabilitation of fragile grassland environments in the USA (Megyeri, 2011). There is very little data on the invasion area on the environmental impact of infestations of A. trifida. In the USA, A. trifida has been identified as a public health problem since the 1930s due to its allergenic pollen and its presence in urban areas. Historically, Gahn (1933) had already indicated that hundreds of thousands of people were affected by allergy problems without any quantified costs being mentioned. The allergens are well known (Goldstein et al., 1994). Today, A. trifida (and its congener A. artemisiifolia) are the main cause of seasonal allergic rhinitis in eastern and middle USA. The Ambrosia pollen also contributes to the exacerbation of asthma and allergenic conjunctivitis (Oh, 2018). It is recommended that individuals allergic to Ambrosia pollen may adjust their outdoor activities to avoid contact with the allergen (e.g. https://www.aafa.org/ragweed-pollen/). The health effect remains significant to such a point that visitor numbers at certain tourist sites are affected according to the presence of species of the genus Ambrosia. Consequently, tourism can be impaired if visitors avoid areas with high Ambrosia occurrence (Durham, 1949). Control At the plot scale, it is technically possible to achieve total control of A. trifida by a combination of chemical and mechanical weed control and agronomic practices. Currently, the development of resistance to herbicides, particularly to ALS inhibitors and glyphosate, is reducing the effectiveness of control (Heap, 2017). Moreover, supplementary mechanical management is not really feasible on a large scale. At the regional scale, it is likely that the spread cannot be reliably prevented, as shown by the progression of A. trifida on the North American continent (Royer & Dickinson, 1999). Regulatory status In the EPPO region, A. trifidais is included on the EPPO A2 list of pests recommended for regulation as a quarantine pest. It is also listed by the Eurasian Economic Union (A2 List). All Ambrosia species are regulated in Directive 2002/32/EC as undesirable substances in animal feed. In the EU, grain intended for bird feed is subject to regulations that severely restrict the presence of seeds of species of the genus Ambrosia (50 mg kg−1 of grain, Regulation (EU) 2015/186 of 6 February 2015). In the USA, A. trifida has the status of ‘restricted noxiousweed’ in four states (California, Delaware, New Jersey and Wisconsin) under the Federal Seed Act (USDA, 2018) and the status of ‘noxious weed’ in four states [California, Delaware, Illinois and Minnesota (in two counties only)] under the Federal Noxious Weed Act and Minnesota Noxious Weed Law (USDA, https://plants.usda.gov/java/noxComposite?stateRpt=yes; Minnesota Department of agriculture, https://www.mda.state.mn.us/plants/pestmanagement/weedcontrol/noxiouslist/countynoxiousweeds). In Canada, A. trifida is listed as a ‘primary noxious weed’ under the Weed Seeds Order of the Seeds Act (http://www.gazette.gc.ca/rp-pr/p2/2016/2016-05-18/html/sor-dors93-eng.html) and as a ‘noxious weed’ under the noxious weed laws in the provinces of Ontario, Quebec, and Manitoba (Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs, http://www.omafra.gov.on.ca/english/crops/facts/info_ragweed.htm).

rayyan-220223374,Analysis of carbon sequestration sensitivity to recent changes in land use patterns over Belgium using a combination of models and remote sensing techniques,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Changes in land use/land cover (LU/LC) practices are critical to determine and this is one of the crucial driving forces of terrestrial ecosystem productivity and carbon sink variability. However, relatively few studies have quantified the impact of LU/LC change on the terrestrial carbon cycle. In the present study, we developed a workflow for quantifying and assessing changes in terrestrial carbon stocks due to land use change using a dynamic vegetation model. The main objectives are to assess status and variation in carbon stocks across land covers, towards the quantification of spatial distribution and dynamic variation of terrestrial carbon sinks in response to LU/LC change. Here, with the CARAIB dynamic vegetation model, we perform simulations using several sets of LU/LC data to analyse the sensitivity of the carbon sink. We propose a new method of using satellite &amp;amp;#8211; and machine learning-based observation to reconstruct historical LU/LC change and compare it with static data from the cadastral map and dynamic data from an agent-based model coupled with CARAIB. It will quantify the spatial and temporal variability of land use during the 2000-2019 period over Belgium at high resolution. This study will give the space to analyse past information and hence calibrate the dynamic vegetation model to minimize uncertainty in the future projection (until 2035). Overall, this study allows us to understand the effect of changing land use pattern and identify the input dataset which minimizes the uncertainty in model estimation.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu2020-9342,"",,
rayyan-220223386,Cidades compactas e mais verdes: conciliando densidade urbana e vegetação por meio do desenho urbano,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Compact green cities: reconciling urban density and vegetation through urban designDue to the rapid city growth of cities worlwide in the last decades and the predictive scenarios of urban population growt, strategies for the design of more compact and environmentallyfriendly cities are becoming increasingly urgent.Although, reconciling urban density and the provision of green spaces -in order to achieve greater resilience in the face of climate change -has been one of the great challenges of contemporary cities.Several studies in the literature suggest that these meanings are opposite and therefore, set a negative correlation with each other.The research hypothesis is the urban design is a key element to deal with this contradiction and to seek effective and balanced solutions for use land, as well as, create ""softer"" matrixes to promote ecological connectivity and ecosystem services.The aim is to investigate the impact of urban forms on spatial features of residential green spaces (RGS), and how to reconcile high density and vegetation cover through morphological studies.The case studies are located in São Paulo, Brasilia (Brazil) and Berlin (Germany), and comprised high-density residential-mixed use sample areas, classified into eight morphological types.We used landscape metrics variables to measure the composition and configuration of RGS (area-PLAND, average patch size, connectivity-ENN and aggregation index-AI) and morphological and land use metrics, such as population and housing densities, floor space index-FSI, and coverage building or ground floor space-GSI.Spatial data were generated and processed using GIS and remote sensing techniques and analyzed through univariate and multivariate methods.Different morphological configurations, which have the same housing density rate, showed large vegetation range with average differences of up to 88% in tree cover area, 91% in average tree patch size, 46% in connectivity (distance between green space) and 30% in aggregation index of the vegetation.The block-based urban design perform better in reconciling high urban density and high tree cover than urban design based on guidelines and land parameters applied only to the plot.We found out that external factors, such as mobility and sociocultural issues, can influence on urban design and impact on the composition and configuration of EVR.From the best evaluated sample units, we set design guidelines and reference parameters regarding to landscape and urban morphology variables, as well as, the obstacles and challenges of the applicability of these lessons in the Brazilian urban context.The results could help decision makers in setting urban strategies and urban public policies towards compact green cities, thus enhancing ecosystem services, urban biodiversity and better quality of life.Moreover, the results of this research bring advances in the understanding and integration of urban morphology and landscape ecology, as well as closing the gaps between science and the practice of urban planning and design.","",https://doi.org/10.11606/t.11.2020.tde-04052020-152955,"",,
rayyan-220223417,DSCOVR/EPIC-derived global hourly/daily downward shortwave and photosynthetically active radiation data at 0.1° × 0.1° resolution,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract. Downward shortwave radiation (SW) and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) play crucial roles in Earth system dynamics. Spaceborne remote sensing techniques provide a unique means for mapping accurate spatio-temporally-continuous SW/PAR, globally. However, any individual polar-orbiting or geostationary satellite cannot satisfy the desired high temporal resolution (sub-daily) and global coverage simultaneously, while integrating and fusing multi-source data from complementary satellites/sensors is challenging because of co-registration, inter-calibration, near real-time data delivery and the effects of discrepancies in orbital geometry. The Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera (EPIC) onboard the Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR), launched in February 2015, offers an unprecedented possibility to bridge the gap between high temporal resolution and global coverage, and characterize the diurnal cycles of SW/PAR globally. In this study, we adopted a suite of well-validated data-driven machine-learning models to generate the first global land products of SW/PAR, from June 2015 to June 2019, based on DSCOVR/EPIC data. The derived products have high temporal resolution (hourly) and medium spatial resolution (0.1° × 0.1°), and include estimates of the direct and diffuse components of SW/PAR. We used independently widely-distributed ground station data from the Baseline Surface Radiation Network (BSRN), the Surface Radiation Budget Network (SURFRAD), NOAA's Global Monitoring Division and the U.S. Department of Energy’s Atmospheric System Research (ASR) program to evaluate the performance of our products, and further analyzed and compared the spatio-temporal characteristics of the derived products with the benchmarking Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System Synoptic (CERES) data. We found both the hourly and daily products to be consistent with ground-based observations (e.g., hourly and daily total SWs have low biases of −3.96 and −0.71 W/m2 and root mean square errors (RMSEs) of 103.50 and 35.40 W/m2, respectively). The developed products capture the complex spatio-temporal patterns well and accurately track substantial diurnal, monthly, and seasonal variations of SW/PAR when compared to CERES data. They provide a reliable and valuable alternative for solar photovoltaic applications worldwide and can be used to improve our understanding of the diurnal and seasonal variabilities of the terrestrial water, carbon and energy fluxes at various spatial scales.

rayyan-220223512,Using deep convolutional neural networks to forecast spatial patterns of Amazonian deforestation,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"A bstract Tropical forests are subject to diverse deforestation pressures but their conservation is essential to achieve global climate goals. Predicting the location of deforestation is challenging due to the complexity of the natural and human systems involved but accurate and timely forecasts could enable effective planning and on-the-ground enforcement practices to curb deforestation rates. New computer vision technologies based on deep learning can be applied to the increasing volume of Earth observation data to generate novel insights and make predictions with unprecedented accuracy. Here, we demonstrate the ability of deep convolutional neural networks to learn spatiotemporal patterns of deforestation from a limited set of freely available global data layers, including multispectral satellite imagery, the Hansen maps of historic deforestation (2001-2020) and the ALOS JAXA digital surface model, to forecast future deforestation (2021). We designed four original deep learning model architectures, based on 2D Convolutional Neural Networks (2DCNN), 3D Convolutional Neural Networks (3DCNN), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) to produce spatial maps that indicate the risk to each forested pixel (~30 m) in the landscape of becoming deforested within the next year. They were trained and tested on data from two ~80,000 km 2 tropical forest regions in the Southern Peruvian Amazon. We found that the networks could predict the likely location of future deforestation to a high degree of accuracy. Our best performing model – a 3DCNN – had the highest pixel-wise accuracy (80-90%) when validated on 2020 deforestation based 2014-2019 training. Visual examination of the forecasts indicated that the 3DCNN network could automatically discern the drivers of forest loss from the input data. For example, pixels around new access routes (e.g. roads) were assigned high risk whereas this was not the case for recent, concentrated natural loss events (e.g. remote landslides). CNNs can harness limited time-series data to predict near-future deforestation patterns, an important step in using the growing volume of satellite remote sensing data to curb global deforestation. The modelling framework can be readily applied to any tropical forest location and used by governments and conservation organisations to prevent deforestation and plan protected areas.","",https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.12.14.472442,"",,
rayyan-220223555,Automatic Deforestation Detection based on the Deep Learning in Ukraine,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Ukraine's big problem is the disappearance of forest cover. According to the international forest monitoring project Global Forest Watch, Ukraine lost 1.08Mha of forests from 2000 to 2020. Such sad statistics are possible only due to the lack of monitoring tools for the forest industry in Ukraine. Such a tool can be created by combining Remote Sensing and Deep Learning approaches. To implement such approach for the automatic use, we combine Optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar images of the Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-1 satellite missions on which object-detection is performed using a U-Net-based neural network trained with use of the semi-supervised learning technique. This approach is being tested and shows its effectiveness in Kyiv region and going to be implemented in the same way for the Lviv, Odessa and Zakarpatya oblasts.","",https://doi.org/10.1109/idaacs53288.2021.9661008,"",,
rayyan-220223564,Use of Cellular Automata-Based Artificial Neural Networks For Detection and Prediction of Land Use Changes in North Eastern Dhaka City,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract The purpose of this study was to examine the pattern of change in Land Use Land Cover (LULC) and Land Surface Temperature (LST) in Mirpur and its surrounding area (north-eastern part of Dhaka) over the last 30 years using Landsat Satellite images and remote sensing indices, and to develop relationships between LULC types and LST, as well as to analyze their impact on local warming. Using this analyzed data, a further projection of LULC and LST change over the next two decades was made. From 1989 to 2019, five-year intervals of Landsat 4-5 TM and Landsat 8 OLI pictures were utilized to track the relationship between LULC changes and LST. Cellular Automata-based Artificial Neural Network (CA-ANN) algorithm was used to model the LULC and LST maps for the year 2039. Two environmental indices were analyzed to determine their link with LST: the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Normalized Difference Built-up Index (NDBI). The link between LST and LULC types indicates that built-up area raises LST by substituting non-evaporating surfaces for natural vegetation. The average surface temperature has been increasing steadily for the previous 30 years. For the year 2019, it was determined that roughly 86 percent of total land area has been converted to built-up area and that 89 percent of land area has an LST greater than 28°C. According to the study, if the current trend continues, 72 percent of the Mirpur area is predicted to see temperatures near 32°C in 2039. Additionally, LST had a significant positive association with NDBI and a negative correlation with NDVI. The overall accuracy of LULC was greater than 90%, with a Kappa coefficient of 0.83. The study may assist urban planners and environmental engineers in comprehending and recommending effective policy measures and plans to mitigate the consequences of LULC.","",https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-993126/v1,"",,
rayyan-220223588,Fusing Landsat and SAR Data for Mapping Tropical Deforestation through Machine Learning Classification and the PVts-<b>β</b> Non-Seasonal Detection Approach,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"This article focuses on mapping tropical deforestation using time series and machine learning algorithms. Before detecting changes in the time series, we reduced seasonality using Photosynthetic Vegetation (PV) index fractions obtained from Landsat images. Single and multi-temporal filters were used to reduce speckle noise from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images (i.e., ALOS PALSAR and Sentinel-1B) before fusing them with optical images through Principal Component Analysis (PCA). We detected only one change in the two PV series using a non-seasonal detection approach, as well as in the fused images through five machine learning algorithms that were calibrated with Cross-Validation (CV) and Monte Carlo Cross-Validation (MCCV). In total, four categories were obtained: forest, cropland, bare soil, and water. We then compared the change map obtained with time series and that obtained with the classification algorithms with the best calibration performance, revealing an overall accuracy of 92.91% and 91.82%, respectively. For statistical comparisons, we used deforestation reference data. Finally, we conclude with some discussions and reflections on the advantages and disadvantages of the detections made with time series and machine learning algorithms, as well as the contribution of SAR images to the classifications, among other aspects.","",https://doi.org/10.1080/07038992.2021.1941823,"",,

The Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, as one of the most developed megacities in China, sets up a goal of high-quality development while fostering ecosystem services. Therefore, assessing the ecosystem services in this study area is very important to guide further development. However, the spatial pattern of ecosystem services, especially at local scales, is not well understood. Using the available 2017 land cover product, Sentinel-1 SAR and Sentinel-2 optical images, a deep learning land cover mapping framework integrating deep change vector analysis and the ResUnet model was proposed. Based on the produced 10 m land cover map for the year 2020, recent spatial patterns of the ecosystem services at different scales (i.e., the GBA, 11 cities, urban–rural gradient, and pixel) were analyzed. The results showed that: (1) Forest was the primary land cover in Guangzhou, Huizhou, Shenzhen, Zhuhai, Jiangmen, Zhaoqing, and Hong Kong, and an impervious surface was the main land cover in the other four cities. (2) Although ecosystem services in the GBA were sufficient to meet their demand, there was undersupply for all the three general services in Macao and for the provision services in Zhongshan, Dongguan, Shenzhen, and Foshan. (3) Along the urban–rural gradient in the GBA, supply and demand capacity showed an increasing and decreasing trend, respectively. As for the city-level analysis, Huizhou and Zhuhai showed a fluctuation pattern while Jiangmen, Zhaoqing, and Hong Kong presented a decreasing pattern along the gradient. (4) Inclusion of neighborhood landscape led to increased demand scores in a small proportion of impervious areas and oversupply for a very large percent of bare land.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/su13137044,"",,
rayyan-220223606,Building a machine learning surrogate model for wildfire activities within a global earth system model,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract. Wildfire is an important ecosystem process, influencing land biogeophysical and biogeochemical dynamics and atmospheric composition. Fire-driven loss of vegetation cover, for example, directly modifies the surface energy budget as a consequence of changing albedo, surface roughness, and partitioning of sensible and latent heat fluxes. Carbon dioxide and methane emitted by fires contribute to a positive atmospheric forcing, whereas emissions of carbonaceous aerosols may contribute to surface cooling. Process-based modeling of wildfires in earth system land models is challenging due to limited understanding of human, climate, and ecosystem controls on fire number, fire size, and burned area. Integration of mechanistic wildfire models within Earth system models requires careful parameter calibration, which is computationally expensive and subject to equifinality. To explore alternative approaches, we present a deep neural network (DNN) scheme that surrogates the process-based wildfire model within the Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM). The DNN wildfire model accurately simulates the observed burned area with over 90 % higher accuracy with a large reduction in parameterization time compared with the current process-based wildfire model. The surrogate wildfire model successfully captured global dynamics of wildfire burned areas between years 2011 and 2015 (R2 = 0.93). Since the DNN wildfire model has the same input and output requirements as the E3SM process-based wildfire model, our results demonstrate the applicability of machine learning for high accuracy and efficient large-scale land model development and predictions.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-2021-83,"",,

They promise to be reference models that could be used to improve computationally affordable coarse-grid global climate models across a range of climates, reducing uncertainties in regional precipitation and temperature trends. Here, machine learning of nudging tendencies as functions of column state is used to correct the physical parameterization tendencies of temperature, humidity, and optionally winds, in a real-geography coarse-grid model (FV3GFS with a 200~km grid) to be closer to those of a 40-day reference simulation using X-SHiELD, a modified version of FV3GFS with a 3~km grid. Both simulations specify the same historical sea-surface temperature fields. This methodology builds on a prior study using a global observational analysis as the reference. The coarse-grid model without machine learning corrections has too little cloud, causing too much daytime heating of land surfaces that creates excessive surface latent heat flux and rainfall. This bias is avoided by learning downwelling radiative flux from the fine-grid model. The best configuration uses learned nudging tendencies for temperature and humidity but not winds. Neural nets slightly outperform random forests. Forecasts of 850 hPa temperature gain 18 hours of skill at 3–7 day leads and time-mean precipitation patterns are improved 30\% by applying the ML correction. Adding machine-learned wind tendencies improves 500 hPa height skill for the first five days of forecasts but degrades time-mean upper tropospheric temperature and zonal wind patterns thereafter.","",https://doi.org/10.1002/essoar.10507879.1,"",,
rayyan-220223624,ForestEyes Project - Citizen Science and Machine Learning to detect deforested areas in tropical forests,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"The conservation of tropical forests is urgent and necessary due to the important role they play in the global ecosystem. Several governmental and private initiatives were created to detect deforestation in tropical forests through analyses of remote sensing images, which demands skilled labor and different ways to deal with a great amount of data. Citizen Science could be used to mitigate these challenges, as it consists of nonspecialized volunteers collecting, analyzing, and classifying data to solve technical and scientific problems. In this sense, this work proposes the ForestEyes Project 1, which aims to combine citizen science and machine learning for deforestation detection. The volunteers classify remote sensing images, and these data are used as the training set for classification algorithms. The volunteers classified more than 5, 000 tasks from remote sensing images of the Brazilian Legal Amazon, and the results were compared to a groundtruth from the Amazon Deforestation Monitoring Project PRODES. The volunteers achieved good labeling of the remote sensing data, even for recent deforestation tasks, building high-confidence labeled collections as they selected the most relevant samples and discarded noisy segments that might disrupt machine learning techniques. Finally, the proposed methodology is promising, and with improvements, it could be able to generate complementary information to official monitoring programs or even generate information for areas not yet monitored.","",https://doi.org/10.5753/sibgrapi.est.2021.20008,"",,

The input variables were terrestrial water storage anomaly (TWSA) recorded by the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellites and the GRACE-Follow-On (GRACE-FO) mission, precipitation measured by the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite, average temperature and soil moisture obtained from the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS), and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI) acquired from the Landsat 5 and 8 satellites. A comparison of groundwater storage change predictions by the two deep learning predictive models with in situ measurements of the National Groundwater Monitoring Network (NGMN) in South Korea showed that the CNN-LSTM model was more accurate [root mean square error (RMSE) = 44.92 mm/month, correlation coefficient (r) = 0.70, index of agreement (IOA) = 0.81] than the LSTM model [RMSE = 47.44 mm/month, r = 0.62, and IOA = 0.77]. Furthermore, a comparison of the performance of the two models for three specific regions showed that the CNN-LSTM model captured spatiotemporal variations in groundwater storage better. Additionally, a comparison of cumulative change trends in groundwater storage with the NDVI, MNDWI, and TWSA data showed that changes in land cover and total water storage affect groundwater storage. These comparison results demonstrate that the use of parameters recorded by multiple satellites as training data for deep learning models can play an important role in the model's performance.","",https://doi.org/10.1109/access.2021.3130306,"",,
rayyan-220223659,AI-ForestWatch: semantic segmentation based end-to-end framework for forest estimation and change detection using multi-spectral remote sensing imagery,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Forest change detection is crucial for sustainable forest management. The changes in the forest area due to deforestation (such as wild fires or logging due to development activities) or afforestation alter the total forest area. Additionally, it impacts the available stock for commercial purposes, climate change due to carbon emissions, and biodiversity of the forest habitat estimations, which are essential for disaster management and policy making. In recent years, foresters have relied on hand-crafted features or bi-temporal change detection methods to detect change in the remote sensing imagery to estimate the forest area. Due to manual processing steps, these methods are fragile and prone to errors and can generate inaccurate (i.e., under or over) segmentation results. In contrast to traditional methods, we present AI-ForestWatch, an end to end framework for forest estimation and change analysis. The proposed approach uses deep convolution neural network-based semantic segmentation to process multi-spectral space-borne images to quantitatively monitor the forest cover change patterns by automatically extracting features from the dataset. Our analysis is completely data driven and has been performed using extended (with vegetation indices) Landsat-8 multi-spectral imagery from 2014 to 2020. As a case study, we estimated the forest area in 15 districts of Pakistan and generated forest change maps from 2014 to 2020, where major afforestation activity is carried out during this period. Our critical analysis shows an improvement of forest cover in 14 out of 15 districts. The AI-ForestWatch framework along with the associated dataset will be made public upon publication so that it can be adapted by other countries or regions.","",https://doi.org/10.1117/1.jrs.15.024518,"",,

However, most of the existing studies used physical models, which are not accurate enough due to our limited ability to represent the ET process accurately or rarely focused on cropland. In this study, we trained two models of estimating croplands ET. The first is Medlyn-Penman-Monteith (Medlyn-PM) model. It uses artificial neural network (ANN)-derived gross primary production along with Medlyn’s stomatal conductance to compute surface conductance (Gs), and the computed Gs is used to estimate ET using the PM equation. The second model, termed ANN-PM, directly uses ANN to construct Gs and simulate ET using the PM equation. The results showed that the two models can reasonably reproduce ET with ANN-PM showing a better performance, as indicated by the lower error and higher determination coefficients. The results also showed that the performances of ANN-PM without the facilitation of any remote sensing (RS) factors degraded significantly compared to the versions that used RS factors. We also evidenced that ANN-PM can reasonably characterize the time-series changes of ET at sites having a dry climate. The ANN-PM method can reasonably estimate the ET of croplands under different environmental conditions.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/app11188649,"",,

The explicit modelling of regional ecological responses and their impact on individual species is a significant prerequisite for any adaptation strategy. The present study focuses on predicting the regional distribution of Rhododendron arboreum, a medicinal plant species found in the Himalayan region. Advanced Species Distribution Models (SDM) based on the principle of predefined hypothesis, namely BIOCLIM, was used to model the potential distribution of Rhododendron arboreum. This hypothesis tends to vary with the change in locations, and thus, robust models are required to establish nonlinear complex relations between the input parameters. To address this nonlinear relation, a class of deep neural networks, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture is proposed, designed, and tested, which eventually gave much better accuracy than the BIOCLIM model. Both of the models were given 16 input parameters, including ecological and atmospheric variables, which were statistically resampled and were then utilized in establishing the linear and nonlinear relationship to better fit the occurrence scenarios of the species. The input parameters were mostly acquired from the recent satellite missions, including MODIS, Sentinel-2, Sentinel-5p, the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM), and ECOSTRESS. The performance across all the thresholds was evaluated using the value of the Area Under Curve (AUC) evaluation metrics. The AUC value was found to be 0.917 with CNN, whereas it was 0.68 with BIOCLIM, respectively. The performance evaluation metrics indicate the superiority of CNN for species distribution over BIOCLIM.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/rs13163284,"",,
rayyan-220223703,A Robust Hybrid Deep Learning Model for Spatiotemporal Image Fusion,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Dense time-series remote sensing data with detailed spatial information are highly desired for the monitoring of dynamic earth systems. Due to the sensor tradeoff, most remote sensing systems cannot provide images with both high spatial and temporal resolutions. Spatiotemporal image fusion models provide a feasible solution to generate such a type of satellite imagery, yet existing fusion methods are limited in predicting rapid and/or transient phenological changes. Additionally, a systematic approach to assessing and understanding how varying levels of temporal phenological changes affect fusion results is lacking in spatiotemporal fusion research. The objective of this study is to develop an innovative hybrid deep learning model that can effectively and robustly fuse the satellite imagery of various spatial and temporal resolutions. The proposed model integrates two types of network models: super-resolution convolutional neural network (SRCNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM). SRCNN can enhance the coarse images by restoring degraded spatial details, while LSTM can learn and extract the temporal changing patterns from the time-series images. To systematically assess the effects of varying levels of phenological changes, we identify image phenological transition dates and design three temporal phenological change scenarios representing rapid, moderate, and minimal phenological changes. The hybrid deep learning model, alongside three benchmark fusion models, is assessed in different scenarios of phenological changes. Results indicate the hybrid deep learning model yields significantly better results when rapid or moderate phenological changes are present. It holds great potential in generating high-quality time-series datasets of both high spatial and temporal resolutions, which can further benefit terrestrial system dynamic studies. The innovative approach to understanding phenological changes’ effect will help us better comprehend the strengths and weaknesses of current and future fusion models.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/rs13245005,"",,

For traditional water body extraction methods, it is difficult to select image texture and features, the shadows of buildings and other ground objects are in the same spectrum as water bodies, the existing deep convolutional neural network is difficult to train, the consumption of computing resources is large, and the methods cannot meet real-time requirements. In this paper, a water body extraction method based on lightweight MobileNetV2 is proposed and applied to multisensor high-resolution remote sensing images, such as GF-2, WorldView-2 and UAV orthoimages. This method was validated in two typical complex geographical scenes: water bodies for farmland irrigation, which have a broken shape and long and narrow area and are surrounded by many buildings in towns and villages; and water bodies in mountainous areas, which have undulating topography, vegetation coverage and mountain shadows all over. The results were compared with those of the support vector machine, random forest and U-Net models and also verified by generalization tests and the influence of spatial resolution changes. First, the results show that the F1-score and Kappa coefficients of the MobileNetV2 model extracting water bodies from three different high-resolution images were 0.75 and 0.72 for GF-2, 0.86 and 0.85 for Worldview-2 and 0.98 and 0.98 for UAV, respectively, which are higher than those of traditional machine learning models and U-Net. Second, the training time, number of parameters and calculation amount of the MobileNetV2 model were much lower than those of the U-Net model, which greatly improves the water body extraction efficiency. Third, in other more complex surface areas, the MobileNetV2 model still maintained relatively high accuracy of water body extraction. Finally, we tested the effects of multisensor models and found that training with lower and higher spatial resolution images combined can be beneficial, but that using just lower resolution imagery is ineffective. This study provides a reference for the efficient automation of water body classification and extraction under complex geographical environment conditions and can be extended to water resource investigation, management and planning.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/s21217397,"",,

Remote sensing (RS) can support effective monitoring and mapping approaches for tropical forests, and to facilitate this we propose a deep neural network with an encoder–decoder architecture here to classify tropical forests and their environment. To deal with the complexity of tropical landscapes, this method utilizes a multi-scale convolution neural network (CNN) to expand the receptive field and extract multi-scale features. The model refines the features with several attention modules and fuses them through an upsampling module. A two-stage training strategy is proposed to alleviate misclassifications caused by sample imbalances. A joint loss function based on cross-entropy loss and the generalized Dice loss is applied in the first stage, and the second stage used the focal loss to fine-tune the weights. As a case study, we use Hainan tropical reserves to test the performance of this model. Compared with four state-of-the-art (SOTA) semantic segmentation networks, our network achieves the best performance with two Hainan datasets (mean intersection over union (MIoU) percentages of 85.78% and 82.85%). We also apply the new model to classify a public true color dataset which has 17 semantic classes and obtain results with an 83.75% MIoU.

Studies on the reliability of these hydropower plants due to climate and land-use/land cover changes on the hydrology of these rivers are scanty. Therefore, this study aimed to model the impact of the changing climate and land-use/cover on hydropower reliability to aid proper planning and management. The hydropower reliability of Muzizi River catchment was determined from its past (1998–2010) and midcentury (2041–2060) discharge at 30 and 95% exceedance probability under Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) of 4.5 and 8.5, respectively. The past and projected hydropower were compared to determine how future climate and land-use changes will impact the discharge and hydropower reliability of Muzizi River catchment. Six LULC scenarios (deforestation, 31–20%; grassland, 19–3%; cropland, 50–77%; water bodies, 0.02–0.01%; settlement, 0.23–0.37%, and Barren land 0.055–0.046% between 2014 and 2060) and three downscaled Regional Climate Model (REMO and RCA4 for precipitation and RACMO22T for temperature from a pool of four CORDEX (Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment) Africa RCMs) were examined. A calibrated SWAT simulation model was applied for the midcentury (2041–2060) period, and a potential change in hydropower energy in reference to mean daily flow (designflow ≥ 30% exceedance probability), firm flow (flow ≥ 95% exceedance probability), and mean annual flow was evaluated under the condition of altered runoff under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 climate change scenarios for an average of REMO and RCA4 RCM. The future land use (2060) was projected using the MOLUSCE (Module for Land Use Change Evaluation) plugin in QGIS using CA-ANN. Three scenarios have been described in this study, including LULC change, climate change, and combined (climate and LULC change). The results suggest that there will be a significant increase in annual hydropower generation capacity (from 386.27 and 488.1 GWh to 867.82 and 862.53 GWh under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, respectively) for the combined future effect of climate and land-use/cover changes.

Remotely-sensed satellite data enable us to detect and assimilate these events into weather models to improve their global-scale forecasts. Despite the significant advances in satellite imagery and image processing techniques, weather data assimilation methods currently employ conventional approaches that can be slow and inaccurate. This letter aims to bridge this gap by utilizing deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) to accurately and rapidly detect weather patterns in satellite images. InceptionV3, ResNet50, VGG16, and VGG19, as four state-of-the-art CNN models, are used to classify 9081 optical satellite images into five different weather events of convective cell clouds, tropical cyclones, convective roll clouds, wildfires, and dust storms. All these models obtained a satisfactory average accuracy of more than 80%. Among the CNNs, VGG-Nets were found to have difficulties in distinguishing roll convection from cell convection patterns. Overall, InceptionV3 was the best model by achieving an average accuracy of 92% in detecting such weather systems. The letter demonstrates the strength of these CNN techniques for weather pattern recognition that can be instrumental for atmospheric science research and weather/climate models.","",https://doi.org/10.1080/2150704x.2021.1978581,"",,

The Pastaza Marañón Foreland Basin (PMFB), within the Peruvian Amazon, is known to store large amounts of peat, but the remoteness of the region makes field data collection and mapping the distribution of peatland ecotypes challenging. Here we review methods for developing high accuracy peatland maps for the PMFB using a combination of multi-temporal synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and optical remote sensing in a machine learning classifier. The new map produced has 95% overall accuracy with low errors of commission (1–6%) and errors of omission (0–15%) for individual peatland classes. We attribute this improvement in map accuracy over previous maps of the region to the inclusion of high and low water season SAR images which provides information about seasonal hydrological dynamics. The new multi-date map showed an increase in area of more than 200% for pole forest peatland (6% error) compared to previous maps, which had high errors for that ecotype (20–36%). Likewise, estimates of C stocks were 35% greater than previously reported (3.238 Pg in Draper et al. (2014) to 4.360 Pg in our study). Most of the increase is attributed to pole forest peatland which contributed 58% (2.551 Pg) of total C, followed by palm swamp (34%, 1.476 Pg). In an assessment of deforestation from 2010 to 2018 in the PMFB, we found 89% of the deforestation was in seasonally flooded forest and 43% of deforestation was occurring within 1 km of a river or road. Peatlands were found the least affected by deforestation and there was not a noticeable trend over time. With development of improved transportation routes and population pressures, future land use change is likely to put South American tropical peatlands at risk, making continued monitoring a necessity. Accurate mapping of peatland ecotypes with high resolution (&amp;lt;30 m) sensors linked with field data are needed to reduce uncertainties in estimates of the distribution of C stocks, and to aid in deforestation monitoring.","",https://doi.org/10.3389/feart.2021.676748,"",,

The objective of this study is to identify the changeover of land-use changes in the Bhavani basin for the two periods 2005 and 2015, as well as to forecast and establish potential land-use changes in the year 2025 and 2030 by using QGIS 2.18.24 version MOLUSCE plugin (ANN-Multi layer perception) model.The five criteria, such as DEM, gradient, aspect, distance from the road and river, and built-up density, are used as spatial variable maps in the processes of learning in ANN-Multi layer perception to predict their influences on LULC between 2005 and 2010 and it was found that DEM, distance from the road and river, and built-up density have significant effects. The projected and accurate LULC maps for 2015 indicate a good level of accuracy, with an overall Kappa value of 0.69 and with a percentage of the correctness 76.28 %.

Degradation, in particular those caused by selective logging, result in features whose detection is a challenge to remote sensing, due to its size, space configuration, and geographical distribution. From the available remote sensing technologies, SAR data allow monitoring even during adverse atmospheric conditions. The aim of this study was to test different pre-trained models of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for change detection associated with forest degradation in bitemporal products obtained from a pair of SAR COSMO-SkyMed images acquired before and after logging in the Jamari National Forest. This area contains areas of legal and illegal logging, and to test the influence of the speckle effect on the result of this classification by applying the classification methodology on previously filtered and unfiltered images, comparing the results.

This vulnerability is likely to increase with sea level rise and greater storminess over future decadal-scale time periods. The accurate, rapid, and wide-scale determination of shoreline position, and its migration, is therefore imperative for future coastal risk adaptation and management. This paper develops and applies an automated tool, VEdge_Detector, to extract the coastal vegetation line from high spatial resolution (Planet’s 3 to 5 m) remote-sensing imagery, training a very deep convolutional neural network (holistically nested edge detection), to predict sequential vegetation line locations on annual to decadal timescales. Red, green, and near-infrared (RG-NIR) was found to be the optimum image spectral band combination during neural network training and validation. The VEdge_Detector outputs were compared with vegetation lines derived from ground-referenced positional measurements and manually digitized aerial photographs, which were used to ascertain a mean distance error of <6 m (two image pixels) and >84% producer accuracy (PA) at six out of the seven sites. Extracting vegetation lines from Planet imagery of the rapidly retreating cliffed coastline at Covehithe, Suffolk, United Kingdom, has identified a landward retreat rate >3 m year−1 (2010–2020). Plausible vegetation lines were successfully retrieved from images in The Netherlands and Australia, which were not used to train the neural network, although significant areas of exposed rocky coastline proved to be less well recovered by VEdge_Detector. The method therefore promises the possibility of generalizing to estimate retreat of sandy coastlines from Planet imagery in otherwise data-poor areas, which lack ground-referenced measurements. Vegetation line outputs derived from VEdge_Detector are produced rapidly and efficiently compared to more traditional non-automated methods. These outputs also have the potential to inform upon a range of future coastal risk management decisions, incorporating future shoreline change.","",https://doi.org/10.1080/01431161.2021.1897185,"",,

However, Argo gridded data have short temporal coverage (from 2005 to the present), inhibiting understanding of long-term OHC variabilities at decadal to multidecadal scales. In this study, we utilized multisource remote sensing and Argo gridded data based on the long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network method, which considers long temporal dependence to reconstruct a new long time-series OHC dataset (1993–2020) and fill the pre-Argo data gaps. Moreover, we adopted a new machine learning method, i.e., the Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM), and applied the well-known Random Forests (RFs) method for comparison. The model performance was measured using determination coefficients (R2) and root-mean-square error (RMSE). The results showed that LSTM can effectively improve the OHC prediction accuracy compared with the LightGBM and RFs methods, especially in long-term and deep-sea predictions. The LSTM-estimated result also outperformed the Ocean Projection and Extension neural Network (OPEN) dataset, with an R2 of 0.9590 and an RMSE of 4.45 × 1019 in general in the upper 2000 m for 28 years (1993–2020). The new reconstructed dataset (named OPEN-LSTM) correlated reasonably well with other validated products, showing consistency with similar time-series trends and spatial patterns. The spatiotemporal error distribution between the OPEN-LSTM and IAP datasets was smaller on the global scale, especially in the Atlantic, Southern and Pacific Oceans. The relative error for OPEN-LSTM was the smallest for all ocean basins compared with Argo gridded data. The average global warming trends are 3.26 × 108 J/m2/decade for the pre-Argo (1993–2004) period and 2.67 × 108 J/m2/decade for the time-series (1993–2020) period.

Deforestation in the Amazon rainforest is an alarming problem of global interest. Environmental impacts of this process are countless, but probably the most significant concerns regard the increase in CO2 emissions and global temperature rise. Currently, the assessment of deforested areas in the Amazon region is a manual task, where people analyse multiple satellite images to quantify the deforestation. We propose a method for automatic deforestation detection based on Deep Learning Neural Networks with dual-attention mechanisms. We employed a siamese architecture to detect deforestation changes between optical images in 2018 and 2019. Experiments were performed to evaluate the relevance and sensitivity of hyperparameter tuning of the loss function and the effects of dual-attention mechanisms (spatial and channel) in predicting deforestation. Experimental results suggest that a proper tuning of the loss function might bring benefits in terms of generalisation. We also show that the spatial attention mechanism is more relevant for deforestation detection than the channel attention mechanism. When both mechanisms are combined, the greatest improvements are found, and we reported an increase of 1.06% in the mean average precision over a baseline.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/isprs-archives-xliii-b3-2021-851-2021,"",,

This policy aims to relocate populations from poverty-stricken areas with fragile ecological environments, which inevitably leads to changes in land cover and the ecological environment. The objective of this study was to identify the effects of EM in a typical region (Wuwei), including changes in the land cover and ecological risk (ER). A land cover change monitoring method was implemented for the 2010–2019 period for six land cover classes using random forest, which is an effective supervised machine learning method. The land cover change patterns were analyzed by determining the area changes of the six classes and applying a land use transition matrix, and a landscape ecological risk model based on landscape disturbance and fragility was used. Our results demonstrate that the increase and decrease in the area of cultivated land, unused land, and construction land can be divided into two stages (2010–2015 and 2015–2019). The area of water and perennial snow doubled during the study periods. The major land cover transitions were between unused land and construction land and between unused land and crop land. In addition, the ER value for the Qilian Mountain National Nature Reserve decreased because of the implementation of EM in the study area, indicating that the ecological environment was effectively improved.

Our H2M model simulates the dynamics of snow, soil moisture, and groundwater pools globally at 1º spatial resolution and daily time step where simulated water fluxes depend on an embedded recurrent neural network. We trained the model simultaneously against observational products of terrestrial water storage variations (TWS), runoff, evapotranspiration, and snow water equivalent with a multi-task learning approach. We find that H2M is capable of reproducing the key patterns of global water cycle components with model performances being at least on par with four state-of-the-art global hydrological models. The neural network learned hydrological responses of evapotranspiration and runoff generation to antecedent soil moisture state that are qualitatively consistent with our understanding and theory. Simulated contributions of groundwater, soil moisture, and snowpack variability to TWS variations are plausible and within the large range of traditional GHMs. H2M indicates a somewhat stronger role of soil moisture for TWS variations in transitional and tropical regions compared to GHMs. Overall, we present a proof of concept for global hybrid hydrological modeling in providing a new, complementary, and data-driven perspective on global water cycle variations. With further increasing Earth observations, hybrid modeling has a large potential to advance our capability to monitor and understand the Earth system by facilitating a data-adaptive yet physically consistent, joint interpretation of heterogeneous data streams.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-2021-211,"",,

This resource, however, is undergoing significant declines across the globe, and there is an urgent need to develop change detection techniques appropriate to the scale of loss and applicable to the complex coastal marine environment. Our work aimed to develop remote-sensing-based techniques for detection of changes between 1990 and 2019 in the area of seagrass meadows in Tauranga Harbour, New Zealand. Four state-of-the-art machine-learning models, Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Extreme Gradient Boost (XGB), and CatBoost (CB), were evaluated for classification of seagrass cover (presence/absence) in a Landsat 8 image from 2019, using near-concurrent Ground-Truth Points (GTPs). We then used the most accurate one of these models, CB, with historic Landsat imagery supported by classified aerial photographs for an estimation of change in cover over time. The CB model produced the highest accuracies (precision, recall, F1 scores of 0.94, 0.96, and 0.95 respectively). We were able to use Landsat imagery to document the trajectory and spatial distribution of an approximately 50% reduction in seagrass area from 2237 ha to 1184 ha between the years 1990–2019. Our illustration of change detection of seagrass in Tauranga Harbour suggests that machine-learning techniques, coupled with historic satellite imagery, offers potential for evaluation of historic as well as ongoing seagrass dynamics.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/ijgi10060371,"",,

In the tropics, deforestation, which causes high carbon emissions and threatens biodiversity, is often linked to agricultural expansion. While the need for deforestation-free global supply chains is widely recognized, making progress in practice remains a challenge. Here, we propose an automated approach that aims to support conservation and sustainable land use planning decisions by mapping tropical landscapes at large scale and high spatial resolution following the High Carbon Stock (HCS) approach. A deep learning approach is developed that estimates canopy height for each 10 m Sentinel-2 pixel by learning from sparse GEDI LIDAR reference data, achieving an overall RMSE of 6.3 m. We show that these wall-to-wall maps of canopy top height are predictive for classifying HCS forests and degraded areas with an overall accuracy of 86 % and produce a first high carbon stock map for Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.","",https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2107.07431,"",,

Improving our understanding of the rate, timing, and distribution of landscape change is needed to determine the impact on wildlife populations and biodiversity, ultimately leading to better-informed management regarding requirements for habitat amount and its connectedness. In this research, we assessed the viability of an approach to detect from–to class changes designed to be scalable to the prairie region with the capacity for local refinement. It employed a deep-learning convolutional neural network to model general land covers and examined class memberships to identify land-cover conversions. For this implementation, eight land-cover categories were derived from the Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada Annual Space-Based Crop Inventory. Change was assessed in three study areas that contained different mixes of grassland, pasture, and forest cover. Results showed that the deep-learning method produced the highest accuracy across all classes relative to an implementation of random forest that included some first-order texture measures. Overall accuracy was 4% greater with the deep-learning classifier and class accuracies were more balanced. Evaluation of change accuracy suggested good performance for many conversions such as grassland to crop, forest to crop, water to dryland covers, and most bare/developed-related changes. Changes involving pasture with grassland or cropland were more difficult to detect due to spectral confusion among classes. Similarly, conversion to forests in some cases was poorly detected due to gradual and subtle change characteristics combined with confusion between forest, shrub, and croplands. The proposed framework involved several processing steps that can be explored to enhance the thematic content and accuracy for large regional implementation. Evaluation for understanding connectivity in natural land covers and related declines in species at risk is planned for future research.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/rs13040634,"",,

PRODES and DETER project together turned 33 years-old with an undeniably contribution to the state-of-art in mapping and monitoring tropical deforestation in Brazil. Monitoring systems all over the world have taken advantage of big data repositories of remote sensing data as they are becoming freely available together with artificial intelligence. Thus, considering the advent of new generation remote sensing data hubs, online platforms of big data that can fill in spatial and temporal resolutions gaps in current deforestation mapping, this work aims to present recent innovations at INPE´s deforestation monitoring systems in Brazil and how they are gauging new realms of technological levels. Recent innovations at INPE´s monitoring systems are: 1) the development of TerraBrasilis platform of data access and analysis; 2) the adoption of new sensors and cloud detection strategies; 3) the complementary use of multi-sensor images; 4) the complementary adoption of SAR C-band images using cloud data to sample and process Sentinel-1. Future innovations are: 1) development of a Brazilian data cube to be used in deep learning techniques of image classification; 2) Routine uncertainty analysis of PRODES data. Automatization might fasten mapping process, but the real challenge is to succeed in automatization maintaining data quality and historical series. The hyper-availability of remote sensing data, the initiative of a Brazilian Data Cube and promising machine learning techniques applied to land cover change detection, allowed INPE to reinforce its central role in tropical forest monitoring.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/isprs-archives-xliii-b3-2021-843-2021,"",,

Ensuring its quality requires maintaining its biogeophysical characteristics, and environmental studies must consider space-time scales and sustainable perspectives to balance environmental, economic, and social needs. This study evaluates environmental conservation in a hydrographic basin in Brazil's São Paulo state and proposes integrating two types of spatial analysis generally applied separately. The Land Change Modeler was used to model future land use by using artificial neural networks and CA-Markov. Environmental conservation levels were obtained through multicriteria evaluation for three scenarios, verified through field visits and the application of an ecological diversity protocol. Significant changes were noted, primarily related to anthropic disorders, with land use map values for 2028 indicating dominant trends in the anthropized area and silviculture. Priority areas for conservation are the reservoir, Brazilian Cerrado, wetlands, bodies of water, riparian forest, and silviculture. Fragmented natural vegetation was identified in regions with springs and high, but dispersed, values of environmental conservation. Mean and minimum values anticipated increase, indicating a tendency for degradation, which could be mitigated by incentive policies for preservation and conservation. Environmental management and inspection by public agencies are needed at reservoir sites used for recreation, tourism, and fishing. Finally, the study's integrated methods proved satisfactory for assessing conservation dynamics and providing data to inform strategic planning for effective land use management focused on sustaining natural resources.","",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jag.2021.102452,"",,
rayyan-220223927,Predicting Forest Fire Using Remote Sensing Data And Machine Learning,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Over the last few decades, deforestation and climate change have caused increasing number of forest fires. In Southeast Asia, Indonesia has been the most affected country by tropical peatland forest fires. These fires have a significant impact on the climate resulting in extensive health, social and economic issues. Existing forest fire prediction systems, such as the Canadian Forest Fire Danger Rating System, are based on handcrafted features and require installation and maintenance of expensive instruments on the ground, which can be a challenge for developing countries such as Indonesia. We propose a novel, cost-effective, machine-learning based approach that uses remote sensing data to predict forest fires in Indonesia. Our prediction model achieves more than 0.81 area under the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve, performing significantly better than the baseline approach which never exceeds 0.70 area under ROC curve on the same tasks. Our model's performance remained above 0.81 area under ROC curve even when evaluated with reduced data. The results support our claim that machine-learning based approaches can lead to reliable and cost-effective forest fire prediction systems.","",https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i17.17758,"",,

Recently, climate change and human activities have resulted in higher frequencies of wildfires throughout the world. Timely and accurate detection of the burned areas can help to make decisions for their management. Remote sensing satellite imagery can have a key role in mapping burned areas due to its wide coverage, high-resolution data collection, and low capture times. However, although many studies have reported on burned area mapping based on remote sensing imagery in recent decades, accurate burned area mapping remains a major challenge due to the complexity of the background and the diversity of the burned areas. This paper presents a novel framework for burned area mapping based on Deep Siamese Morphological Neural Network (DSMNN-Net) and heterogeneous datasets. The DSMNN-Net framework is based on change detection through proposing a pre/post-fire method that is compatible with heterogeneous remote sensing datasets. The proposed network combines multiscale convolution layers and morphological layers (erosion and dilation) to generate deep features. To evaluate the performance of the method proposed here, two case study areas in Australian forests were selected. The framework used can better detect burned areas compared to other state-of-the-art burned area mapping procedures, with a performance of &gt;98% for overall accuracy index, and a kappa coefficient of &gt;0.9, using multispectral Sentinel-2 and hyperspectral PRISMA image datasets. The analyses of the two datasets illustrate that the DSMNN-Net is sufficiently valid and robust for burned area mapping, and especially for complex areas.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/rs13245138,"",,

Automatic satellite imagery analysis can significantly accelerate the process of tree type classification, which is traditionally carried out by ground-based observation. Although computer vision methods have proven their efficiency in remote sensing tasks, specific challenges arise in forestry applications. The forest inventory data often contain the tree type composition but do not describe their spatial distribution within each individual stand. Therefore, some pixels can be assigned a wrong label in the semantic segmentation task if we consider each stand to be homogeneously populated by its dominant species. Another challenge is the spatial distribution of individual stands within the study area. Classes are usually imbalanced and distributed nonuniformly that makes sampling choice more critical. This study aims to enhance tree species classification based on a neural network approach providing automatic markup adjustment and improving sampling technique. For forest species markup adjustment, we propose using a weakly supervised learning approach based on the knowledge of dominant species content within each stand. We also propose substituting the commonly used CNN sampling approach with the object-wise one to reduce the effect of the spatial distribution of forest stands. We consider four species commonly found in Russian boreal forests: birch, aspen, pine, and spruce. We use imagery from the Sentinel-2 satellite, which has multiple bands (in the visible and infrared spectra) and a spatial resolution of up to 10 meters. A data set of images for Leningrad Oblast of Russia is used to assess the methods. We demonstrate how to modify the training strategy to outperform a basic CNN approach from F1-score 0.68 to 0.76. This approach is promising for future studies to obtain more specific information about stands composition even using incomplete data.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/f12101413,"",,

Changing conditions, including forestry interventions, or lack of them, may endanger its preservation. Abandonment of management in forests previously subjected to a multipurpose silviculture and secondary succession is hypothesized to have altered the biodiverse Mediterranean forests in recent years and affected plant diversity. We used data in national forest inventory plots and local landscape ecology metrics from forest cartography, combined with artificial neural networks, to predict richness and Shannon diversity indices for the tree and shrub layers of several Mediterranean forest types. We found that richness and diversity depend on forest structure and on local landscape patterns, and also, though to a lesser degree, on site conditions (mainly soil pH), but not on forest intervention. In order to benefit plant diversity in the forest landscapes analyzed, forest management practices need to promote diameter variety, the presence of large trees, tree cover, variation in the height of trees and shrubs, and a heterogeneous local landscape at the stand level. Aleppo pine forests and Scots pine forests showed more consistent results in their models than cork oak and black pine forests, both of which require further research.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/su132111658,"",,

This study uses Maxent, a species distribution model that employs a maximum entropy machine learning approach to map the spatial distributions of habitats suitable for the International Union for Conservation of Nature threatened birds under present and future climate and land-use change in Borneo. We find that the existing protected areas provide very low coverage of the threatened bird species’ suitable habitat areas (95%CI = 9.3–15.4%). Analysis of habitat suitability projections for 18 species of threatened birds suggests that in 2050, under Special Report on Emissions Scenarios A1B and B1, avian species with currently little suitable habitat may gain area but lose in the proportion of this that is protected. Large-ranged species are likely to lose habitat area and this will inflate the proportion of this remaining in protected areas. The present availability of suitable habitat was the most important determinant of future habitat availability under both the scenarios. Threat level, as measured by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and the habitat preferences considered here, Lowland or Lowland–Montane, are poor predictors of the amount of habitat contraction or expansion undergone by the species.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/su13052792,"",,

Therefore, in order to protect the ecological environment, regulate urban development and pursue the maximization of ecological benefits, it is necessary to analyze, simulate and predict land use change. In this study, Hengyang City was taken as the study area, and based on the current land use data of Hengyang City in 2010, 2015, and 2018, the land use type transfer during 2010–2015 and 2015–2018 was analyzed. Then, starting from 2010, the FLUS model was used to simulate the spatial distribution of land use in 2015 and 2018, and then the spatial distribution of land use in Hengyang City in 2025 was predicted with the Markov prediction method under the premise of ecological protection priority. The results show that the change in ecological land in Hengyang City is mainly distributed in the surrounding and marginal areas, because the topography of Hengyang City is a basin. Changes in land type in Hengyang City in 2015 were subtle and difficult to observe. However, in 2018, the transformation of non-ecological land into ecological land was obvious, and the distribution area of ecological land expanded significantly. The Kappa index of the results simulated by the FLUS model based on neural network is above 0.72, and overall accuracy is above 0.9, which is highly consistent with the actual situation. It is reasonable and convincing to predict the spatial distribution of land use in the context of ecological protection. The predicted results can be useful for urban planning and land use distribution and provide a reference for relevant decision-makers.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/su131810458,"",,

Traditional remote sensing platforms, such as Landsat and MODIS, are ill-suited for distinguishing native and non-native vegetation species in arid regions due to their large pixels compared to plant sizes. Unmanned aircraft systems, or UAS, offer the potential to capture the high spatial resolution imagery needed to differentiate species. However, in order to extract the most benefits from these platforms, there is a need to develop more efficient and effective workflows. This paper presents an integrated spectral–structural workflow for classifying invasive vegetation species in the Lower Salt River region of Arizona, which has been the site of fires and flooding, leading to a proliferation of invasive vegetation species. Visible (RGB) and multispectral images were captured and processed following a typical structure from motion workflow, and the derived datasets were used as inputs in two machine learning classifications—one incorporating only spectral information and one utilizing both spectral data and structural layers (e.g., digital terrain model (DTM) and canopy height model (CHM)). Results show that including structural layers in the classification improved overall accuracy from 80% to 93% compared to the spectral-only model.

This paper reviews six data sources that are most commonly used to investigate LULC and change in the contiguous U.S. by highlighting the main characteristics, strengths and weaknesses and considering how uncertainty is assessed by the June Area Survey (JAS), the Census of Agriculture (COA), the Farm Survey Agency (FSA) acreage, the National Resources Inventory (NRI), the National Wetlands Inventory (NWI), and the Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA); and two remote sensing-based data products, the Cropland Data Layer (CDL) and the National Land Cover Database (NLCD).

As a result, deforestation has catastrophic consequences for the environment, including the loss of biodiversity, disruption of clean water supplies, and the acceleration of climate change. According to statistics, the deforestation trend in developing countries is at an alarming rate including Malaysia where plantation activities are the primary cause of forest loss. Recent anecdotal studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of the deep learning-based (DL) approach in producing deforestation maps. However, there are limited studies concentrating on DL approach for synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging due to complexity of the computational concepts of the method. The SAR imagery can be challenging to interpret but its all-weather and all-day capability can be critical in forest monitoring compared to optical imagery. Thus, in this study, we propose to map deforestation areas in Permanent Forest Reserve (HSK) using multi-temporal Sentinel-1 SAR data. Deep learning-based U-Net was employed to classify the SAR imagery as forest and non-forest due to its semantic segmentation capabilities. The experiment results showed that the proposed deep learning-based technique successfully achieved 0.993 of intersection over union (IoU) and 0.980 of overall accuracy (OA).

This particularly applies to the Antarctic Dry Valleys, which host an ecosystem highly adapted to the extreme conditions in this cold desert. To predict possible climate induced changes on the Dry Valley ecosystem, high spatial and temporal resolution environmental variables are needed. Thus we enhanced the spatial resolution of the MODIS satellite LST product that is sensed sub-daily at a 1 km spatial resolution to a 30 m spatial resolution. We employed machine learning models that are trained using Landsat 8 thermal infrared data from 2013 to 2019 as a reference to predict LST at 30 m resolution. For the downscaling procedure, terrain derived variables and information on the soil type as well as the solar insolation were used as potential predictors in addition to MODIS LST. The trained model can be applied to all available MODIS scenes from 1999 onward to develop a 30 m resolution LST product of the Antarctic Dry Valleys. A spatio-temporal validation revealed an R2 of 0.78 and a RMSE of 3.32 ∘C. The downscaled LST will provide a valuable surface climate data set for various research applications, such as species distribution modeling, climate model evaluation, and the basis for the development of further relevant environmental information such as the surface moisture distribution.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/rs13224673,"",,

To date, multiple land uses are experiencing urban construction-related land expansion, population increase, and socioeconomic development. Comprehensive evaluation and understanding of the effect of urban sprawl and its rapid LUCC are of great importance to managing land surface resources for sustainable development. The present research applied remote sensing data, such as Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper and Landsat-8 Operation Land Imager, on selected images between July and August from 1985 to 2020 with the use of multiple types of software to explore, classify, and analyze the historical and future LUCCs in Baghdad City. Three historical LUCC maps from 1985, 2000, and 2020 were created and analyzed. The result shows that urban construction land expands quickly, and agricultural land and natural vegetation have had a large loss of coverage during the last 35 years. The change analysis derived from previous land use was used as a change direction for future simulation, where natural and anthropogenic factors were selected as the drivers’ variables in the process of multilayer perceptron neural network Markov chain model. The future land use/cover change (FLUCC) modeling results from 2030 to 2050 show that agriculture is the only land use type with a massive decreasing trend from 1985 to 2050 compared with other categories. The entire change in urban sprawl derived from historical and FLUCC in each period shows that urban construction land increases the fastest between 2020 and 2030.

Despite efforts to reduce nutrient pollution, carbon and nutrient concentrations have increased or remained high in many regions. Here, we applied a new ecohydrological framework to ~12,000 water samples collected by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency from streams and lakes across the contiguous U.S. to identify spatial and temporal patterns in nutrient concentrations and leverage (an indicator of flux). For the contiguous U.S. and within ecoregions, we quantified trends for sites sampled repeatedly from 2000 to 2019, the persistence of spatial patterns over that period, and the patch size of nutrient sources and sinks. While we observed various temporal trends across ecoregions, the spatial patterns of nutrient and carbon concentrations in streams were persistent across and within ecoregions, potentially because of historical nutrient legacies, consistent nutrient sources, and inherent differences in nutrient removal capacity for various ecosystems. Watersheds showed strong critical source area dynamics in that 2–8% of the land area accounted for 75% of the estimated flux. Variability in nutrient contribution was greatest in catchments smaller than 250 km 2 for most parameters. An ensemble of four machine learning models confirmed previously observed relationships between nutrient concentrations and a combination of land use and land cover, demonstrating how human activity and inherent nutrient removal capacity interactively determine nutrient balance. These findings suggest that targeted nutrient interventions in a small portion of the landscape could substantially improve water quality at continental scales. We recommend a dual approach of first prioritizing the reduction of nutrient inputs in catchments that exert disproportionate influence on downstream water chemistry, and second, enhancing nutrient removal capacity by restoring hydrological connectivity both laterally and vertically in stream networks.","",https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0258952,"",,

Lack of species data can be overcome with remote sensing because it covers extended geographic areas and generates recurring data. We developed a Deep Learning (DL) framework using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) products and modeled potential species richness by stacking species distribution models (S-SDMs) to ask, “What are the spatial patterns of potential plant species richness across the Korean Peninsula, including inaccessible North Korea, where survey data are limited?” First, we estimated plant species richness in South Korea by combining the probability-based SDM results of 1574 species and used independent plant surveys to validate our potential species richness maps. Next, DL-based species richness models were fitted to the species richness results in South Korea, and a time-series of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and leaf area index (LAI) from MODIS. The individually developed models from South Korea were statistically tested using datasets that were not used in model training and obtained high accuracy outcomes (0.98, Pearson correlation). Finally, the proposed models were combined to estimate the richness patterns across the Korean Peninsula at a higher spatial resolution than the species survey data. From the statistical feature importance tests overall, growing season NDVI-related features were more important than LAI features for quantifying biodiversity from remote sensing time-series data.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/rs13132490,"",,
rayyan-220224292,Assessment of plant species distribution and diversity along a climatic gradient from Mediterranean woodlands to semi-arid shrublands,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Climate and land-use change profoundly affect plant species distribution (SD) and composition, and the impact of these processes is expected to increase in the coming years. As a proxy of global changes, knowledge of SD and diversity along climatic gradients is essential to determine the efforts needed for species conservation. Plant spectral diversity is an emerging approach used as a proxy for species diversity based on remote sensing. Thus, the research aim was to develop a comprehensive methodology based on spectral diversity for SD and richness mapping and to study their relations with environmental and human-derived factors, demonstrated along Mediterranean to semi-arid climatic gradient. The study addresses two main knowledge gaps regarding spectral diversity: (1) improving the accuracy of woody species classification by features extraction and selection, and by using texture analysis in an ecosystem characterized by high spatial variability and relatively small-sized and sparse woody vegetation; and (2) developing a better estimate of the local species ‎richness and their response to environmental and human-derived factors (i.e. climate, topography, substrate, and land cover factors) across a transition zone between Mediterranean woodlands and semi-arid dwarf shrublands. A hyperspectral image was acquired for a 43-km strip along the study area using an airborne flight of AISA-FENIX (380–2500 nm, 420 bands) at the end of the 2017 rainy season. The dominant species were surveyed, with a total number of 247 trees and shrubs, to train a machine learning support vector machine (SVM) classification for species distribution mapping, which yielded an overall accuracy of 86.1%. A feature extraction and selection methodology was developed, combining principal component analysis and neighborhood component analysis techniques, facilitating the identification of 33 spectral diagnostic bands out of 330 spectral bands. The classification accuracy was decreased by about 2% to 84.2% using only 33 spectral bands. The classification accuracy improved by about 7.1% for the seven large crown species (93.3%) by adding texture information. Later, the local species richness was calculated by utilizing the alpha diversity index (i.e. the Shannon Index) for 30-m grid cells and was tested in response to environmental (i.e. climate, substrate, and topography) and human-derived factors (i.e. land cover). The highest sensitivity to alpha diversity factors was mean annual precipitation, slope, and land surface temperature. The alpha diversity showed higher richness in the natural Mediterranean shrubland and the guarrigue located in the northern part of the climate gradient. We suggest that the approach presented here significantly improves the estimation of woody species distribution and diversity in areas characterized by high spatial heterogeneity along steep climatic gradients.","",https://doi.org/10.1080/15481603.2021.1953770,"",,
rayyan-220224361,Cryogenic land surface processes shape vegetation biomass patterns in northern European tundra,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract Tundra ecosystems have experienced changes in vegetation composition, distribution, and productivity over the past century due to climate warming. However, the increase in above-ground biomass may be constrained by cryogenic land surface processes that cause topsoil disturbance and variable microsite conditions. These effects have remained unaccounted for in tundra biomass models, although they can impact multiple opposing feedbacks between the biosphere and atmosphere, ecosystem functioning and biodiversity. Here, by using field-quantified data from northern Europe, remote sensing, and machine learning, we show that cryogenic land surface processes substantially constrain above-ground biomass in tundra. The three surveyed processes (cryoturbation, solifluction, and nivation) collectively reduced biomass by an average of 123.0 g m −2 (−30.0%). This effect was significant over landscape positions and was especially pronounced in snowbed environments, where the mean reduction in biomass was 57.3%. Our results imply that cryogenic land surface processes are pivotal in shaping future patterns of tundra biomass, as long as cryogenic ground activity is retained by climate warming.","",https://doi.org/10.1038/s43247-021-00292-7,"",,

Large internal variability distorts this anthropogenic signal. Models produce diverse magnitudes of precipitation response to anthropogenic forcing, largely due to differing schemes for parameterizing subgrid-scale processes. Meanwhile, multiple global observational datasets of daily precipitation exist, developed using varying techniques and inhomogeneously sampled data in space and time. Previous attempts to detect human influence on extreme precipitation have not incorporated model uncertainty, and have been limited to specific regions and observational datasets. Using machine learning methods that can account for these uncertainties and capable of identifying the time evolution of the spatial patterns, we find a physically interpretable anthropogenic signal that is detectable in all global observational datasets. Machine learning efficiently generates multiple lines of evidence supporting detection of an anthropogenic signal in global extreme precipitation.","",https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-227967/v2,"",,

In Kenya, Arid and Semi-arid Lands (ASAL) occupy 80% of the landscape and are critical for the livelihoods of millions of pastoralists. However, they have been invaded by Invasive Plant Species (IPS) thereby compromising their ecosystem functionality. Opuntia stricta, a well-known IPS, has invaded the ASAL in Kenya and poses a threat to pastoralism, leading to livestock mortality and land degradation. Thus, identification and detailed estimation of its cover is essential for drawing an effective management strategy. The study aimed at utilizing the Sentinel-2 multispectral sensor to detect Opuntia stricta in a heterogeneous ASAL in Laikipia County, using ensemble machine learning classifiers. To illustrate the potential of Sentinel-2, the detection of Opuntia stricta was based on only the spectral bands as well as in combination with vegetation and topographic indices using Extreme Gradient Boost (XGBoost) and Random Forest (RF) classifiers to detect the abundance. Study results showed that the overall accuracies of Sentinel 2 spectral bands were 80% and 84.4%, while that of combined spectral bands, vegetation, and topographic indices was 89.2% and 92.4% for XGBoost and RF classifiers, respectively. The inclusion of topographic indices that enhance characterization of biological processes, and vegetation indices that minimize the influence of soil and the effects of atmosphere, contributed by improving the accuracy of the classification. Qualitatively, Opuntia stricta spatially was found along river banks, flood plains, and near settlements but limited in forested areas. Our results demonstrated the potential of Sentinel-2 multispectral sensors to effectively detect and map Opuntia stricta in a complex heterogeneous ASAL, which can support conservation and rangeland management policies that aim to map and list threatened areas, and conserve the biodiversity and productivity of rangeland ecosystems.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/rs13081494,"",,

The complexity of the state-of-the-art climate models requires high computational resources and imposes rather simplified parameterization of inland waters. The effect of lakes and reservoirs on the local and regional climate is commonly parameterized in regional or global climate modeling as a function of surface water temperature estimated by atmosphere-coupled one-dimensional lake models. The latter typically neglect one of the major transport mechanisms specific to artificial reservoirs: heat and mass advection due to in- and outflows. Incorporation of these essentially two-dimensional processes into lake parameterizations requires a trade-off between computational efficiency and physical soundness, which is addressed in this study. We evaluated the performance of the two most used lake parameterization schemes and a machine learning approach on high-resolution historical water temperature records from 24 reservoirs. Simulations were also performed at both variable and constant water level to explore the thermal structure differences between lakes and reservoirs. Our results highlight that surface water temperatures in reservoirs differ significantly from those found in lakes, reinforcing the need to include anthropogenic inflow and outflow controls in regional and global climate models. Our findings also highlight the efficiency of the machine learning approach, which may overperform process-based physical models both in accuracy and in computational requirements, if applied to reservoirs with long-term observations available. A relationship between mean water retention times and the importance of inflows and outflows is established: reservoirs with the retention time shorter than ~100 days, if simulated without in- and outflow effects, tend to exhibit a statistically significant deviation in the computed surface temperatures regardless of their morphological characteristics.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-2021-64,"",,

In this study, the Land use/land cover changes between the period of 1986 and 2020 in the tropical rainforest of Ghana was considered. A combination of machine learning and Markov chain approach was adopted to project future LULC for 2040 and 2060.The results showed that area covered by Open Forest declined from 21,531.87 km2 to 14,518.82 km2 and Dense Forest also declined from 14,313 km2 to 8202.98 km2 over a period of 34 years.

While traditional in situ or aerial campaigns for forest assessments provide accurate data for analysis at regional level, scaling them to entire countries and beyond with high temporal resolution is hardly possible. In this work, we propose a method based on deep ensembles that densely estimates forest structure variables at country-scale with 10-meter resolution, using freely available satellite imagery as input. Our method jointly transforms Sentinel-2 optical images and Sentinel-1 synthetic-aperture radar images into maps of five different forest structure variables: 95th height percentile, mean height, density, Gini coefficient, and fractional cover. We train and test our model on reference data from 41 airborne laser scanning missions across Norway and demonstrate that it is able to generalize to unseen test regions, achieving normalized mean absolute errors between 11% and 15%, depending on the variable. Our work is also the first to propose a variant of so-called Bayesian deep learning to densely predict multiple forest structure variables with well-calibrated uncertainty estimates from satellite imagery. The uncertainty information increases the trustworthiness of the model and its suitability for downstream tasks that require reliable confidence estimates as a basis for decision making. We present an extensive set of experiments to validate the accuracy of the predicted maps as well as the quality of the predicted uncertainties.

Transmitted by direct contact and by several biting insect species, this disease results in quarantines and animal movement restrictions in horses, cattle and swine. As changes in climate drive shifts in geographic distributions of vectors and the viruses they transmit, there is considerable need to improve understanding of relationships among environmental drivers and patterns of disease occurrence. Multidisciplinary approaches integrating pathology, ecology, climatology, and biogeophysics are increasingly relied upon to disentangle complex relationships governing disease. We used a big data model integration approach combined with machine learning to estimate the potential geographic range of VS across the continental United States (CONUS) under long-term mean climate conditions over the past 30 years. The current extent of VS is confined to the western portion of the US and is related to summer and winter precipitation, winter maximum temperature, elevation, fall vegetation biomass, horse density, and proximity to water. Comparison with a climate-only model illustrates the importance of current processes-based parameters and identifies regions where uncertainty is likely to be greatest if mechanistic processes change. We then forecast shifts in the range of VS using climate change projections selected from CMIP5 climate models that most realistically simulate seasonal temperature and precipitation. Climate change scenarios that altered climatic conditions resulted in greater changes to potential range of VS, generally had non-uniform impacts in core areas of the current potential range of VS and expanded the range north and east. We expect that the heterogeneous impacts of climate change across the CONUS will be exacerbated with additional changes in land use and land cover affecting biodiversity and hydrological cycles that are connected to the ecology of insect vectors involved in VS transmission.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/cli9110159,"",,

Deforestation can be defined as the conversion of forest land cover to another type. It is a process that has massively accelerated its rate and extent in the last several decades. Mainly due to human activities related to socio-economic processes as population growth, expansion of agricultural land, wood extraction, etc. In the meantime, there are great efforts by governments and agencies to reduce these deforestation processes by implementing regulations, which cannot always be properly monitored whether are followed or not. In this work is proposed an approach that can provide forest loss estimations for a short period of time, by using Synthetic Aperture Radar imagery for an area in the Brazilian Amazon. SAR are providing data with almost no alteration due to weather conditions, however they may present other limitations. To mitigate the speckle effect, here was applied the dry coefficient, which is the mean of image values under the first quartile while preserving the spatial resolution. While for obtaining land cover maps containing only forest and non-forest areas an object-based machine learning classification on the Google Earth Engine platform was applied. The preliminary tests were carried out in a bitemporal manner between 2015 and 2019, followed by applying the approach monthly for the year of 2020.

rayyan-220224558,Food Security and Inaccurate Quantification of Groundwater Irrigation Use,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Maintaining food security for an increasing global population while experiencing global climate change and avoiding ecologic damage is a serious challenge for the scientific community. We know that crop yields from irrigated agriculture are approximately twice that of dry land farming thus, irrigated agriculture is a critical component of that security. Whereas agriculturalists are changing cultivation practices and genetically modifying varieties to “get more crop for the drop,” little is being done to resolve our twin groundwater crises of depletion and pollution. Even worse, there has been a vast underestimation of the volume of groundwater used in irrigation. According to the UN approximately 40% of global irrigation is groundwater from wells, the remaining 60% is from surface water. The United States Geological Survey reports similar estimates with groundwater amounting to approximately 50% of irrigation water used in the United States. This accounting method (wells or surface-water sources) of irrigation water use ignores a fundamental hydrologic tenet that globally, approximately half of the surface water is composed of groundwater baseflow. Thus, groundwater use for global irrigation is approximately 70% of the total (40% from wells plus one half of the 60% classified as surface water). Consequently, the twin groundwater crises are of a much greater impact to food security than is generally recognized. Compounding this error is the prediction that water consumption will likely increase in the future. According to the World Water Assessment Program of the United Nations, increasing water demand follows population growth, economic development and changing consumption patterns. Global water demand has increased by 600% over the past 100 years according to a 2016 study by Wada and others. Current global water demand is projected to grow over the next two decades in agriculture as well as industry and domestic uses, water, however, is a finite non-fungible resource for most uses and in many areas all water is allocated. The groundwater crisis revolves around two components (1) excessive groundwater depletion and (2) pollution of the aquifers. Aquifers are being overdeveloped to such a large degree that this extracted water is contributing approximately 10–15% of the annual sea level rise. The depletion is causing reduction in the flow of the riverine environment at a time when climate change is exacerbating water problems. One third of the world's large aquifers are depleted beyond rejuvenation owing to permanent compression and subsidence. Pollution of groundwater generally decreases its value and limits it use. For example, a significant portion of anthropogenic nitrogen is recharged into groundwater so that anthropogenic nitrate is now three times the geogenic values. Further, the total mass of nitrate in groundwater now being transported in groundwater discharge is a substantial contribution to eutrophication of rivers, lakes, and ocean estuaries. If the input of anthropogenic nitrogen to groundwater were to cease today, it would take five or six decades for this “legacy” nitrogen to be discharged from the aquifer. To understand and manage groundwater resources for food security it is necessary to have effective groundwater monitoring networks that provide transparent results to the citizenry for quality and water levels. This is rare in even the high-income countries. Sadly, most countries are not seriously investing in establishing and modernizing this critical infrastructure, though China has recently established such a network. Part of the problem is the lack of remote sensing of our critical parameters. Whereas atmospheric and ocean science parameters are readily accessible, through new remote sensing methods, groundwater monitoring is largely limited to 19th century technology of wells. We have improved data collection and numerical modeling including Geospatial Machine Learning but not remote access to critical parameters with the exception of GRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment). Consequently, we believe that education and knowledge synthesis, to inform the public for the need for action, is currently the most immediate realistic solution to the crisis. We need to take advantage of the existing vast knowledge and experience that is fragmented and siloed across the globe. Yet effective knowledge synthesis and dissemination are beyond the traditional mandate of existing organizations. In response to this deficiency, the not-for-profit the Groundwater Project (gw-project.org) was created in 2017. The purpose of the group is to lead the way, on a global scale, toward an informed citizenry and groundwater management with the vision: “Providing free knowledge tools for developing groundwater sustainably for humanity and ecosystems.” Education, with the resulting public awareness in the general population, currently appears to be the most likely way out of our global groundwater crisis and consequent lack of food security.","",https://doi.org/10.1111/gwat.13122,"",,
rayyan-220224566,"Mapping global forest age from forest inventories, biomass and climate data",,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract. Forest age can determine the capacity of a forest to uptake carbon from the atmosphere. Yet, a lack of global diagnostics that reflect the forest stage and associated disturbance regimes hampers the quantification of age-related differences in forest carbon dynamics. In this study, we provide a new global distribution of forest age circa 2010, estimated using a machine learning approach trained with more than 40,000 plots using forest inventory, biomass and climate data. First, evaluation against the plot level forest age measurements reveals that the data-driven method has a relatively good predictive capacity of classifying old-growth vs. non-old-growth (precision = 0.81 and 0.99 for old-growth and non-old-growth, respectively) forests and estimating corresponding forest ages (NSE = 0.6 and RMSE = 50 years). Yet, there are systematic biases with overestimation in young and underestimation in old forest stands, respectively. Globally, we find a large variability of forest age with the old-growth forests in the tropical regions of Amazon and Congo, and young forests in China and intermediate stands in Europe. On the other hand, we find that the regions with high rates of deforestation or forest degradation (e.g., the arc of deforestation in the Amazon) are largely composed of younger stands. Assessment of forest age in the climate-space shows that the old-forests are either in cold and dry regions or in warm and wet regions, while young-intermediate forests span a large climatic gradient. Finally, a comparison between the presented forest age estimates with a series of regional products reveals differences rooted in different approaches as well as in different in-situ observations and global-scale products. Despite showing robustness in cross-validation results, additional methodological insights on further developments should as much as possible harmonize data across the different approaches. The forest age dataset presented here provides additional insights into the global distribution of forest age in support of a better understanding of the global dynamics in the forest water and carbon cycles. The forest age datasets are openly available at https://doi.org/10.17871/ForestAgeBGI.2021 (Besnard et al., 2021).

rayyan-220224579,A remote sensing derived dataset of 100 million individual tree crowns for the National Ecological Observatory Network,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract  Forests provide biodiversity, ecosystem and economic services. Information on individual trees is important for understanding forest ecosystems but obtaining individual-level data at broad scales is challenging due to the costs and logistics of data collection. While advances in remote sensing techniques allow surveys of individual trees at unprecedented extents, there remain technical challenges in turning sensor data into tangible information. Using deep learning methods, we produced an open-source dataset of individual-level crown estimates for 100 million trees at 37 sites across the United States surveyed by the National Ecological Observatory Network’s Airborne Observation Platform. Each canopy tree crown is represented by a rectangular bounding box and includes information on the height, crown area, and spatial location of the tree. These data have the potential to drive significant expansion of individual-level research on trees by facilitating both regional analyses and cross-region comparisons encompassing forest types from most of the United States.","",,"",,
rayyan-220224637,Divergent historical GPP trends among state-of-the-art multi-model simulations and satellite-based products,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract. Understanding historical changes in gross primary productivity (GPP) is essential for better predicting the future global carbon cycle. However, the historical trends of terrestrial GPP, owing to the CO2 fertilization effect, climate, and land-use change, remain largely uncertain. Using long-term satellite-based near-infrared radiance of vegetation (NIRv), a proxy for GPP, and multiple GPP datasets derived from satellite-based products, Dynamic Global Vegetation Model (DGVM) simulations, and machine learning techniques, here we comprehensively investigated their trends and analyzed the causes for any discrepancies during 1982–2015. Although spatial patterns of climatological annual GPP from all products and NIRv are highly correlated (r &gt; 0.84), the spatial correlation coefficients of trends between DGVM GPP and NIRv significantly decreased (with the ensemble mean of r = 0.49) and even the spatial correlation coefficients of trends between other GPP products and NIRv became negative. By separating the global land into the tropics plus extra-tropical southern hemisphere (Trop+SH) and extra-tropical northern hemisphere (NH), we found that, during 1982–2015, simulated GPP from most of the models showed a stronger increasing trend over Trop+SH than NH. In contrast, the satellite-based GPP products indicated a substantial increase over NH. Mechanistically, model sensitivity experiments indicated that the increase of annual GPP was dominated by the CO2 fertilization effect (Global: 83.9 %), albeit a large uncertainty in magnitude among individual simulations. However, the spatial distribution of inter-model spreads of GPP trends resulted mainly from climate and land-use change rather than CO2 fertilization effect. Trends after 2000 were different from the full time-series, showing that satellite-based GPP products suggested weakened rising trends over NH and even significantly decreasing trends over Trop+SH, while the trends from DGVMs kept increasing. The inconsistencies are very likely caused by the contrasting performances between satellite-derived and DGVM simulated vegetation structure parameter (leaf area index, LAI). Therefore, the uncertainty in satellite-based GPP products induced by highly uncertain LAI data in the tropics undermines their roles in assessing the performance of DGVM simulations and understanding the changes of global carbon sinks.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-2021-69,"",,
rayyan-220224685,Continuous land cover change detection in a critically endangered shrubland ecosystem using neural networks,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Existing efforts to continuously land cover change using satellite image time-series have mostly focused on forested ecosystems in the tropics and northern hemisphere. The notable difference in reflectance that occurs following deforestation allows land cover change to be detected with relative accuracy. Less progress has been made in detecting change in low productivity, disturbanceprone vegetation such as grasslands and shrublands, where natural dynamics can be difficult to distinguish from habitat loss. Renosterveld is a hyperdiverse, critically endangered shrubland ecosystem in South Africa with less than 5-10% of its original extent remaining in small, highly fragmented patches. I demonstrate that direct classification of satellite image time series using neural networks can accurately detect the transformation of Renosterveld within a few days of its occurrence, and that trained models are suitable for operational continuous monitoring. A dataset of precisely dated vegetation change events between 2016 and 2021 was obtained from daily, high resolution Planet labs satellite data. This dataset was then used to train and evaluate 1D convolutional neural networks and Transformers to continuously detect land cover change events in multivariate time-series of vegetation activity of Sentinel 2 satellite data as it becomes available. The best model correctly identified 89% of land cover change events at the pixel-level, achieving a f-score of 0.93, a 79% improvement over the f-score of 0.52 achieved using a method designed for forested ecosystems based on trend analysis. Models have been deployed to operational use and are producing updated detections of habitat loss every 10 days. There is great potential for supervised approaches to continuous monitoring of habitat loss in ecosystems with complex natural dynamics. A key limiting step is the development of accurately dated datasets of land cover change events with which to train machine learning classifiers.","",https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.10.26.465837,"",,
rayyan-220224686,Forest Type and Tree Species Classification of Nemoral Forests With Sentinel-1 and 2 Time Series Data,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Mapping forest extent and forest cover classification are important for the assessment of forest resources in socio-economic as well as ecological terms. Novel developments in the availability of remotely sensed data, computational resources, and advances in areas of statistical learning have enabled fusion of multi-sensor data, often yielding superior classification results. Most former studies of nemoral forests fusing multi-sensor and multi-temporal data have been limited in spatial extent and typically to a simple classification of landscapes into major land cover classes. We hypothesize that multi-temporal, multi-censor data will have a specific strength in further classification of nemoral forest landscapes owing to the distinct seasonal patterns of the phenology of broadleaves. This study aimed to classify the Danish landscape into forest/non-forest and further into forest types (broadleaved/coniferous) and species groups, using a cloud-based approach based on multi-temporal Sentinel 1 and 2 data and machine learning (random forest) trained with National Forest Inventory (NFI) data. Mapping of non-forest and forest resulted in producer accuracies of 99% and 90 %, respectively. The mapping of forest types (broadleaf and conifer) within the forested area resulted in producer accuracies of 95% for conifer and 96% for broadleaf forest. Tree species groups were classified with producer accuracies ranging 34-74%. Species groups with coniferous species were the least confused whereas the broadleaf groups, especially Oak, had higher error rates. The results are applied in Danish National accounting of greenhouse gas emissions from forests, resource assessment and assessment of forest biodiversity potentials.","",https://doi.org/10.20944/preprints202101.0235.v1,"",,

The knowledge is needed, e.g., for local forest management, studying the processes driving af-, re-, and deforestation, and can improve the accuracy of carbon-accounting. Remote sensing using airborne LiDAR can be used to perform these measurements of vegetation structure at large scale. We present deep learning systems for predicting wood volume, above-ground biomass (AGB), and subsequently above-ground carbon stocks directly from airborne LiDAR point clouds. We devise different neural network architectures for point cloud regression and evaluate them on remote sensing data of areas for which AGB estimates have been obtained from field measurements in the Danish national forest inventory. Our adaptation of Minkowski convolutional neural networks for regression gave the best results. The deep neural networks produced significantly more accurate wood volume, AGB, and carbon stock estimates compared to state-of-the-art approaches operating on basic statistics of the point clouds. In contrast to other methods, the proposed deep learning approach does not require a digital terrain model. We expect this finding to have a strong impact on LiDAR-based analyses of biomass dynamics.","",https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2112.11335,"",,

U-type neural network can train a better model with less samples, and has good experimental effect in medical image segmentation, but it is rarely used in remote sensing image change detection research. In this paper, the U-type neural network is used to detect the change spots in GF-1 image of Yuzhou City, Henan Province, and compared with FCN, SegNet and Siamese-CNN. Experimental results show that the F1 score of U-type neural network model are 0.699 and 0.66 respectively, which are better than the other three methods, and the omission is lower, which is closer to the label map. Therefore, it is feasible to use U-type neural network for change detection of high-resolution remote sensing images, and it can have high detection accuracy.","",https://doi.org/10.1088/1755-1315/675/1/012166,"",,

However, learning a full set of equations for any component, such as the atmosphere or ocean, is likely to be a very difficult task. Faster progress may be made by keeping the existing components that have been derived using theory and experience with Earth simulations and using machine learning to compose an additive term that corrects their errors. This approach also has several other advantages. Here, studies that have used this approach are reviewed, and additional results are presented to display how well it performs at improving simulation of the Lorenz '96 dynamical equations. The outlook for applying this approach to Earth system modeling and simulating climate change is discussed.

  Satellite Imagery With Bayesian Deep Learning",,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Monitoring and managing Earth's forests in an informed manner is an important requirement for addressing challenges like biodiversity loss and climate change. While traditional in situ or aerial campaigns for forest assessments provide accurate data for analysis at regional level, scaling them to entire countries and beyond with high temporal resolution is hardly possible. In this work, we propose a Bayesian deep learning approach to densely estimate forest structure variables at country-scale with 10-meter resolution, using freely available satellite imagery as input. Our method jointly transforms Sentinel-2 optical images and Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar images into maps of five different forest structure variables: 95th height percentile, mean height, density, Gini coefficient, and fractional cover. We train and test our model on reference data from 41 airborne laser scanning missions across Norway and demonstrate that it is able to generalize to unseen test regions, achieving normalized mean absolute errors between 11% and 15%, depending on the variable. Our work is also the first to propose a Bayesian deep learning approach so as to predict forest structure variables with well-calibrated uncertainty estimates. These increase the trustworthiness of the model and its suitability for downstream tasks that require reliable confidence estimates, such as informed decision making. We present an extensive set of experiments to validate the accuracy of the predicted maps as well as the quality of the predicted uncertainties. To demonstrate scalability, we provide Norway-wide maps for the five forest structure variables.","",,"",,

Despite its importance and finite availability, local-scale monitoring of groundwater withdrawals required for sustainable water management practices is not carried out in most countries, including the United States. In this study, we combine publicly available datasets into a machine learning framework for estimating groundwater withdrawals over the state of Arizona. Here we include evapotranspiration, precipitation, crop coefficients, land use, well density, and watershed stress metrics for our predictions. We employ random forests to predict groundwater withdrawals from 2002-2020 at a 2 km spatial resolution using in-situ groundwater withdrawal data available for Arizona Active Management Areas (AMA) and Irrigation Non-Expansion Areas (INA) from 2002-2009 for training and 2010-2020 for validating the model respectively. The results show high training (R≈ 0.86) and good testing (R≈ 0.69) scores with normalized mean absolute error (NMAE) ≈ 0.64 and normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) ≈ 2.36 for the AMA/INA region. Using this method, we spatially extrapolate the existing groundwater withdrawal estimates to the entire state and observe the co-occurrence of both groundwater withdrawals and land subsidence in South-Central and Southern Arizona. Our model predicts groundwater withdrawals in regions where production wells are present on agricultural lands and subsidence is observed from Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR), but withdrawals are not monitored. By performing a comparative analysis over these regions using the predicted groundwater withdrawals and InSAR-based land subsidence estimates, we observe a varying degree of subsidence for similar volumes of withdrawals in different basins.

Climate change, accompanied by intensified extreme weather events, results in changes in intensity, frequency and magnitude of soil erosion. These unclear future developments make adaption and improvement of soil erosion modelling approaches all the more important. Hypothesizing that models cannot keep up with the data, this review gives an overview of 44 process based soil erosion models, their strengths and weaknesses and discusses their potential for further development with respect to new and improved soil and soil erosion assessment techniques. We found valuable tools in areas, as remote sensing, tracing or machine learning, to gain temporal and spatial distributed high resolution parameterization and process descriptions which could lead to a more holistic modelling approach. Most process based models are so far not capable to implement cross-scale erosional processes or profit from the available resolution on a temporal and spatial scale. We conclude that models need further development regarding their process understanding, adaptability in respect to scale as well as their parameterization and calibration. The challenge is the development of models which are able to simulate soil erosion processes as close to reality as possible, as user-friendly as possible and as complex as it needs to be.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/soil-2021-85,"",,

Understory solar irradiation – the primary driver of surface temperature and evaporative demand – remains poorly represented in vegetation models due to a lack of 3-D canopy geometry. Existing models are further unable to represent processes lacking sufficient parameterization and/or knowledge, with no land model to date utilizing machine learning (ML) to represent vegetation processes. Here, we developed the first hybrid forest ecosystem model using ML (ML-FEM), a specific case of hybrid AI land model (a concept also invented here). In this approach, ML models are trained and validated with a ground-truth dataset, whether observations or high-fidelity simulations, before being applied to vegetation model parameters for inference, internally or externally to the model. Using this approach, we simulated annual understory global solar irradiation (Iu) across 25.2 Mha in southwestern Canada at 1-ha resolution under historical climate and fire scenarios. In cross-validation, we found that linear and ML regression models performed comparably well in the prediction of angular canopy cover (ACC), due to the linearity of its relationship to predictors (linear R2 = 0.938, RMSE = 0.079; ML R2 = 0.939, RMSE = 0.074). Reduced area burned, increased ignitions, and reduced regeneration potential for recent periods resulted in stable or reduced Iu. This suggests that diminished disturbance may reduce Iu through forest aging, masking latent regeneration decline. Only in the most extreme and unconstrained scenarios did Iu increase. In these experiments, conducted in late 2015, we demonstrated an entirely new class of hybrid models that we anticipated to be of vital importance to understanding and representing pattern-based processes in Earth system models.","",https://doi.org/10.31223/x51w5k,"",,
rayyan-220224965,Editorial and News,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"With COP26 being hosted in Glasgow in October, the eyes of the world will be on the UK and how we are responding to the urgent need to tackle climate change. According to Alok Sharma, COP President, ‘If we are serious about holding temperature rises to 1.5°C and adapting to the impacts of climate change, we must change the way we look after our land and seas and how we grow our food. The challenge for the food sector is immense and will require some major changes in the way we grow, process, transport and distribute our food. New technologies will assist in the transition to net zero, but changing consumer attitudes and behaviour will also be key to reducing our meat and dairy consumption, reducing food waste, cutting food miles and improving diets. The September issue of FS&T focuses on sensory and behavioural science and its role in influencing our food choices. COVID-19 has had a dramatic impact on consumer behaviour across the world, for example more people are shopping locally (p22). Creative new business models that use food byproducts to produce new ingredients and foods can help to change the mindset of consumers (p48). Intervention by government to tax ‘unhealthy’ foods has been successful in the case of the Soft Drinks Industrial Levy, which has resulted in small, but significant, changes in health outcomes without causing long-term harm to soft drinks companies (p26). Interest in vegetarian and vegan diets among consumers is increasing rapidly, but the use of plant-based proteins as alternatives to meat and dairy products requires optimisation of taste, texture and appearance to ensure products meet with consumer approval (p30). A better understanding of how genetics can influence our food preferences may be the key to improving people's food choices (p34). Novel technologies, such as augmented reality and gaming, also offer the potential to influence food perceptions and choices by bringing together multiple sensory elements to create a consumer journey (p37). email [email protected] The Food Standards Agency has published its Consumer perceptions of genome edited food report, as part of wider efforts to increase its evidence base in genetic technologies1. The project, carried out by Ipsos MORI, involved members of the public across England, Wales and Northern Ireland in online workshops and activities, followed by a representative survey of over 2,000 consumers. It sought feedback from consumers on their perceptions of genome edited (GE) food and its potential future labelling. The research highlighted low participant awareness of GE and its difference to GM, and the need to educate the public on GE technology for use in foods. Some participants felt regulation and transparent labelling of GE foods would be important, should they reach the UK market. There are currently no genome edited foods authorised for sale in the UK, although some are available elsewhere in the world and GE is a rapidly-growing technology within the global food system. In January 2021, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) launched a consultation into the future regulation of genetic technologies in England, including inviting responses on a proposal to remove GE regulation from wider GM regulation. The responses are due to be published soon. ■ A collaborative research project by AB Agri and the University of Leicester has examined the potential of delivering a cocktail of bacteriophage (the natural viruses of bacteria) via animal feed to reduce Salmonella colonisation in broiler chickens2. The Food Standards Agency (FSA) has published the results of a study that investigated the principal sources of human Campylobacter infection. They confirm that chickens are the source of the majority of human cases of Campylobacter, followed by other animals, such as sheep, pigs and cows3. This infection may have been passed to people directly through food, but could also be via environmental and water contamination. The Campylobacter Source Attribution Study, launched in 2015 as part of the FSA's wider and ongoing Campylobacter Reduction Programme, also reveals an increase in antimicrobial resistance within Campylobacter strains between 1997 and 2018. Work is continuing in this area. Part Two of the National Food Strategy, led by Henry Dimbleby, was published in July 20214. The review was commissioned by government to set out a vision and a plan for a better food system. The National Food Strategy report concludes that the UK now has a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to reshape the food system because the pandemic has created a momentum for change and there is now widespread recognition that we need to change our national diet as a matter of urgency. It identifies the global food system as the single biggest contributor to biodiversity loss, deforestation, drought, freshwater pollution and the collapse of aquatic wildlife, and the second-biggest contributor to climate change, after the energy industry. The report finds that 80% of processed food sold in the UK is unhealthy and that because there is a bigger market for unhealthy food, companies invest more in developing and marketing it. Highly processed foods – high in salt, refined carbohydrates, sugar and fats, and low in fibre – are reported to be on average three times cheaper per calorie than healthier foods. This is described as one reason why bad diet is a particularly acute problem among the least affluent. The UK is identified as the third-fattest country in the G7, with almost three in ten of our adult population obese, and our obesity problem is described as a major factor in the UK's tragically high death rate in the COVID-19 pandemic. The report highlights the need to address environmental damage caused by intensive agriculture. Following our exit from the European Union, the Government has drawn up new system of agricultural subsidies, known as the Environmental Land Management scheme (ELMs), to reward farmers who manage their land sustainably and work to restore biodiversity. However, this is not considered to be enough on its own. The Government's commitment to reduce UK's carbon emissions to net zero by 2050 and to ensure that 30% of our land is protected for nature by 2030 requires farmers to be at the centre of this transition in our food system. The National Farmers’ Union has already committed to become carbon neutral, but the review concludes that some areas of farmland will have to be repurposed or adapted to sequester carbon, mopping up emissions from other industries that still depend on fossil fuels. Many farmers are already trialling new ways to manage their land for the benefit of nature. The review finds that we will have to produce more food from the remaining land using regenerative farming a practices that work with nature instead of against it. It recommends that we must invest in the latest science – AI, robots and new breeding techniques – to increase yields without polluting the land. We must unleash the potential of soilless farming, develop new proteins, and tap the the plant-farming potential of the oceans instead of just pillaging them for fish. Some farmers are introducing livestock back into traditional rotations to improve the soil and reduce the need for fertilisers. The report considers that careful livestock farming can be a boon to the environment, but our current appetite for meat is unsustainable: 85% of total land that produces UK food is used to graze livestock or produce crops to feed to animals. The Government's Climate Change Committee has said we must reduce the amount of meat we eat by 20–50% in order for the UK to reach net zero by 2050. The strategy sets a goal of a 30% reduction over ten years. One idea that has been proposed is the imposition of a ‘meat tax’, but this was – by a long way – the least popular of any measure discussed with citizens during the review. It would also have the consequence of penalising poorer households, because the tax would have to be imposed by weight. For now, at least, the authors believe the Government would be better off nudging consumers into changing their habits while investing in methane reduction projects and the development of alternative proteins. The report emphasises that farmers must be properly recompensed and protected from unfair competition. It argues that there is no point in making UK farmers reduce carbon emissions and restore biodiversity only to open up the market to cheap food produced to lower standards abroad. This would mean exporting all the damaging practices we wish to avoid, while undercutting our own farmers. The report recommends that the Government needs a trade policy that supports its environmental ambitions. The National Food Strategy contains recommendations to address the major issues facing the food system: climate change, biodiversity loss, land use, diet-related disease, health inequality, food security and trade. These are grouped under four main objectives (Figure 1). The Government's new £22bn innovation strategy, (published by the Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy in July 20215), aims to make the UK the world's most innovative nation by 2035; the National Food Strategy independent review recommends that one of the first ‘missions’ should be to create a better food system. In the next twelve months, the Government will publish a Food Strategy white paper, which will be informed by this independent review and the wider stakeholder community. The Government's Food Strategy will aim to support the development of a sustainable, resilient and affordable food system, that will support people to live healthy lives and protect animal health and welfare. It will cover the entire food chain from field to fork, building on work already underway in the Agriculture Act, the Fisheries Act, the Environmental Bill and the Childhood Obesity plan6. Fields of the World (FOW), an open access dataset containing digital twins of international fields, has been launched on the Agrifood Data Marketplace7, a platform that helps organisations to find, manage, and monetise food, farming, and environmental data. The Marketplace was set up in 2019 by Agrimetrics, one of four Agri-tech Centres funded by Innovate UK, with the aim of enabling agrifood organisations to realise the value trapped in their data. FOW is an open access (free to use) dataset consisting of field digital twins for 12 crops spanning 11 countries. It comprises more than 3,500 fields and over 50,000 hectares and includes field boundaries, soil and weather data, and crop cover. It is available via API (Application Programming Interface), which provides the most convenient access mechanism. The project has been supported by Microsoft's AI for Earth initiative and has benefitted from the generous provision of crop-field location data from a range of different international organisations. Despite there being more data than ever before, finding and accessing the right data is difficult. Increasingly, datasets need to be combined and the Agrifood Data Marketplace addresses this challenge by making data interoperable. FOW should enable digital solutions to be created and tested more rapidly and cost effectively. The data have been pre-sourced and pre-linked, enabling users to download and use right away. Users can write queries to identify and obtain just the data elements that they need to assemble a single, smaller bespoke dataset from a range of much larger ones. A Query Builder provides a graphical frontend that assists with query construction and provides example queries, such as fetching all the field boundaries, cropping history, soil, weather and satellite data for all FOW fields in Mexico. The dataset has broad applications and demonstrates how global-scale data and cloud-scale computation can be combined to provide field-level decision support information that previously would have required redundant, expensive effort across thousands of individual field operators. FOW will be of most value to users in the early stages of hypothesis testing and product development, enabling creators to efficiently test their solutions without needing to invest significant time and budget. Yield forecasting, crop anomaly detection and optimised water management are promising early use cases. Green finance, commodities, and crop insurers stand to benefit, alongside arable agriculture. Agrimetrics’ own Data Science team have discovered new ways to forecast crop development and identify crop species from satellite data. As an illustration, the team used the data to drive a crop growth model for wheat in the UK, France and the Netherlands. The model used the FOW weather and soil data as inputs and simulated the development of crop growth over time, resulting in predictions of crop yield. With its ambition to accelerate progress towards a sustainable food system, the Institute of Grocery Distribution (IGD) has partnered with climate solutions expert South Pole to launch a new guide8 to help the food and consumer goods industry take positive, tangible steps towards Net Zero. The guide – Building Your Net Zero Roadmap – A Guide for Industry Leaders and Decision Makers – is designed to help business leaders and decision-makers kick start their own net zero journey. The UK Government has committed to achieving net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, and an increasing number of UK food and consumer goods businesses and industry organisations are committing to net zero by 2040. IGD aims to bring different parts of the industry together, helping everyone to build knowledge, innovate, reach consensus and co-create solutions to the complex challenges ahead. The guide includes the business case for urgent action and a new framework for building a robust net zero strategy, including how to make a start and build momentum. 23 September 2021 ADVANCES IN BREEDING FOR AGRICULTURE – NEW TOOLS FOR NEW SOLUTIONS Venue online Web agri-tech-e.co.uk/event/advances-in-breeding-for-agriculture-new-tools-for-new-solutions/ 6-7 October 2021 7TH ANNUAL TRANSLATIONAL MICROBIOME CONFERENCE Venue Washington DC, USA Web microbiomeconference.com/ 15-16 October 2021 PLANT BASED WORLD CONFERENCE AND EXPO Venue Business Design Centre, London Web plantbasedworldeurope.com/ 31 October – 12 November 2021 COP26 Venue Glasgow Web ukcop26.org/ 1-4 November 2021 35TH EFFOST INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE – HEALTHY INDIVIDUALS, RESILIENT COMMUNITIES, AND GLOBAL FOOD SECURITY Venue Lausanne, Switzerland Web effostconference.com/ 22 November-2 December 2021 FOOD INGREDIENTS EUROPE Venue Frankfurt and online Web figlobal.com/fieurope/en/home.html","",https://doi.org/10.1002/fsat.3503_2.x,"",,
rayyan-220224998,Understanding the distribution of vegetation and its environmental drivers using machine learning methods,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Vegetation plays an important role in the terrestrial biosphere by regulating the fluxes of water, carbon and energy between the land and atmosphere, providing habitat to a vast array of organisms, and ensuring global food and water security. Using satellite imagery collected over the last few decades, multiple studies have found changes in the vegetation distribution, structure and phenology in different regions of the globe. Among the most prominent changes are the expansion and intensification of agriculture, northward advancement of treeline and increased shrubification in northern high latitude ecosystems. Changes in land-use and land-cover could alter food availability for human societies, and changes in natural vegetation could trigger various biophysical and biogeochemical responses and feedbacks to the global climate system. In this dissertation research, we use data sourced from remote sensing platforms and ground-based observation networks, along with machine learning methods to a) characterize and map diverse vegetation types from landscape to continental scales and b) identify the environmental drivers of vegetation distribution and productivity. Knowledge and data products from this research would improve mapping and monitoring of food crops, and also inform representation of vegetation traits and processes used for benchmarking and validation of Earth system models. Knowledge of the environmental drivers of vegetation would help improve our understanding of the underlying mechanisms affecting plant geographic distributions.--Author's abstract","",https://doi.org/10.17760/d20409243,"",,

Using the remote sensing satellite imagery (Landsat) we explore the role of land use land cover change (LULCC) in modifying the terrestrial carbon sequestration. We have constructed our LULCC data over Wallonia, Belgium, and compared it with the ground-based statistical data. However, the results from the satellite base LULCC are overestimating the forest data due to the single isolated trees. We know forests play an important role in mitigating climate change by capturing and sequestering atmospheric carbon. Overall, the conversion of land and increase in urban land can impact the environment. Moreover, quantitative estimation of the temporal and spatial pattern of carbon storage with the change in land use land cover is critical to estimate. The objective of this study is to estimate the inter-annual variability in carbon sequestration with the change in land use land cover. Here, with the CARAIB dynamic vegetation model, we perform simulations using remote sensing satellite-based LULCC data to analyse the sensitivity of the carbon sequestration. We propose a new method of using satellite and machine learning-based observation to reconstruct historical LULCC. It will quantify the spatial and temporal variability of land-use change during the 1985-2020 periods over Wallonia, Belgium at high resolution. This study will give the space to analyse past information and hence calibrate the dynamic vegetation model to minimize uncertainty in the future projection (until 2070). Further, we will also analyse the change in other climate variables, such as CO&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt;, temperature, etc. Overall, this study allows us to understand the effect of changing land-use patterns and to constrain the model with an improved input dataset which minimizes the uncertainty in model estimation.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu21-11207,"",,
rayyan-220225047,Using Remote Sensing Imagery and Machine Learning to Predict Poaching in Wildlife Conservation Parks,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Illegal wildlife poaching is driving the loss of biodiversity. To combat poaching, rangers patrol expansive protected areas for illegal poaching activity. However, rangers often cannot comprehensively search such large parks. Thus, the Protection Assistant for Wildlife Security (PAWS) uses machine learning to help identify the areas with highest poaching risk. As PAWS is deployed to parks around the world, we recognized that many parks have limited resources for data collection and therefore have scarce feature sets. To ensure under-resourced parks have access to meaningful poaching predictions, we introduce the use of publicly available remote sensing data to extract features for parks. By employing this data from Google Earth Engine, we also incorporate previously unavailable dynamic data such as climate and primary production patterns to enrich predictions with seasonal trends. We automate the entire data-to-deployment pipeline and find that, with only using publicly available data, we recuperate prediction performance comparable to predictions made using features manually computed by park specialists. We conclude that the inclusion of satellite imagery creates for a robust system through which parks of any resource level can benefit from poaching risks for years to come.","",https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i18.17977,"",,
rayyan-220225051,"Downscaling CMIP6 Global Solutions to Regional Ocean Carbon Model: Connecting the Mississippi, Gulf of Mexico, and Global Ocean",,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract. Coupled physical-biogeochemical models can significantly reduce uncertainties in estimating the spatial and temporal patterns of the ocean carbon system. Challenges of applying a coupled physical-biogeochemical model in the regional ocean include the reasonable prescription of carbon model boundary conditions, lack of in situ observations, and the oversimplification of certain biogeochemical processes. In this study, we applied a coupled physical-biogeochemical model (Regional Ocean Modelling System, ROMS) to the Gulf of Mexico (GoM) and achieved an unprecedented 20-year high-resolution (5 km, 1/22°) hindcast covering the period of 2000–2019. The model’s biogeochemical cycle is driven by the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 6-Community Earth System Model 2 products (CMIP6-CESM2) and incorporates the dynamics of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) pools as well as the formation and dissolution of carbonate minerals. Model outputs include generally interested carbon system variables, such as pCO2, pH, aragonite saturation state (ΩArag), calcite saturation state (ΩCalc), CO2 air-sea flux, carbon burial rate, etc. The model’s robustness is evaluated via extensive model-data comparison against buoy, remote sensing-based Machine Learning (ML) predictions, and ship-based measurements. Model results reveal that the GoM water has been experiencing an ~ 0.0016 yr−1 decrease in surface pH over the past two decades, accompanied by a ~ 1.66 µatm yr−1 increase in sea surface pCO2. The air-sea CO2 exchange estimation confirms that the river-dominated northern GoM is a substantial carbon sink. The open water of GoM, affected mainly by the thermal effect, is a carbon source during summer and a carbon sink for the rest of the year. Sensitivity experiments are conducted to evaluate the impacts from river inputs and the global ocean via model boundaries. Our results show that the coastal ocean carbon cycle is dominated by enormous carbon inputs from the Mississippi River and nutrient-stimulated biological activities, and the carbon system condition of the open ocean is primarily driven by inputs from the Caribbean Sea via Yucatan Channel.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-2021-339,"",,
rayyan-220225129,Using deep convolutional neural networks to forecast spatial patterns of Amazonian deforestation,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract Tropical forests are subject to diverse deforestation pressures while their conservation is essential to achieve global climate goals. Predicting the location of deforestation is challenging due to the complexity of the natural and human systems involved but accurate and timely forecasts could enable effective planning and on‐the‐ground enforcement practices to curb deforestation rates. New computer vision technologies based on deep learning can be applied to the increasing volume of Earth observation data to generate novel insights and make predictions with unprecedented accuracy. Here, we demonstrate the ability of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to learn spatiotemporal patterns of deforestation from a limited set of freely available global data layers, including multispectral satellite imagery, the Hansen maps of annual forest change (2001–2020) and the ALOS PALSAR digital surface model, to forecast deforestation (2021). We designed four model architectures, based on 2D CNNs, 3D CNNs, and Convolutional Long Short‐Term Memory (ConvLSTM) Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), to produce spatial maps that indicate the risk to each forested pixel (~30 m) in the landscape of becoming deforested within the next year. They were trained and tested on data from two ~80,000 km 2 tropical forest regions in the Southern Peruvian Amazon. The networks could predict the location of future forest loss to a high degree of accuracy ( F 1 = 0.58–0.71). Our best performing model (3D CNN) had the highest pixel‐wise accuracy ( F 1 = 0.71) when validated on 2020 forest loss (2014–2019 training). Visual interpretation of the mapped forecasts indicated that the network could automatically discern the drivers of forest loss from the input data. For example, pixels around new access routes (e.g. roads) were assigned high risk, whereas this was not the case for recent, concentrated natural loss events (e.g. remote landslides). Convolutional neural networks can harness limited time‐series data to predict near‐future deforestation patterns, an important step in harnessing the growing volume of satellite remote sensing data to curb global deforestation. The modelling framework can be readily applied to any tropical forest location and used by governments and conservation organisations to prevent deforestation and plan protected areas.","",https://doi.org/10.1111/2041-210x.13953,"",,
rayyan-220225133,Improving Deforestation Detection on Tropical Rainforests Using Sentinel-1 Data and Convolutional Neural Networks,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Detecting early deforestation is a fundamental process in reducing forest degradation and carbon emissions. With this procedure, it is possible to monitor and control illegal activities associated with deforestation. Most regular monitoring projects have been recently proposed, but most of them rely on optical imagery. In addition, these data are seriously restricted by cloud coverage, especially in tropical environments. In this regard, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is an attractive alternative that can fill this observational gap. This work evaluated and compared a conventional method based on time series and a Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) with bi-temporal SAR images. These approaches were assessed in two regions of the Brazilian Amazon to detect deforestation between 2019 and 2020. Different pre-processing techniques, including filtering and stabilization stages, were applied to the C-band Sentinel-1 images. Furthermore, this study proposes to provide the network with the distance map to past-deforestation as additional information to the pair of images being compared. In our experiments, this proposal brought up to 4% improvement in average precision. The experimental results further indicated a clear superiority of the DL approach over a time series-based deforestation detection method used as a baseline in all experiments. Finally, the study proved the benefits of pre-processing techniques when using detection methods based on time series. On the contrary, the analysis revealed that the neural network could eliminate noise from the input images, making filtering innocuous and, therefore, unnecessary. On the other hand, the stabilization of the input images brought non-negligible accuracy gains to the DL approach.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/rs14143290,"",,

Machine learning approaches offer the tools to process, analyse and interpret large data sets, giving insights into trends and guiding evidence‐based allocation of limited resources to maximise positive biodiversity outcomes. Here we describe how data acquired from remote sensing, citizen science and other monitoring approaches could feed in near‐real time into an early warning system for biodiversity that integrates automated red‐listing of species with the identification of priority areas for conservation. Summary Application of machine learning approaches is aiding biodiversity conservation and research at a time of rapid global change. Two emerging topics and their data requirements are presented. First, to identify areas of priority protection for preventing biodiversity loss, reinforcement learning is used by training models that take into account human disturbance and climate change under recurrent monitoring schemes. Second, neural networks are used to approximate classification of species into Red List categories of the International Union for Conservation of Nature, offering the possibility of real‐time re‐classification after events such as widespread fires and deforestation. We discuss how the identification of areas and species most at risk could be integrated into an ‘early warning system’ based on climatic monitoring, remotely sensed land‐use changes and near‐real time biological and threat data from citizen science initiatives. Such system would help guide actions to prevent biodiversity loss at the speed required for effective conservation.","",https://doi.org/10.1002/ppp3.10337,"",,
rayyan-220225148,Building a machine learning surrogate model for wildfire activities within a global Earth system model,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract. Wildfire is an important ecosystem process, influencing land biogeophysical and biogeochemical dynamics and atmospheric composition. Fire-driven loss of vegetation cover, for example, directly modifies the surface energy budget as a consequence of changing albedo, surface roughness, and partitioning of sensible and latent heat fluxes. Carbon dioxide and methane emitted by fires contribute to a positive atmospheric forcing, whereas emissions of carbonaceous aerosols may contribute to surface cooling. Process-based modeling of wildfires in Earth system land models is challenging due to limited understanding of human, climate, and ecosystem controls on fire counts, fire size, and burned area. Integration of mechanistic wildfire models within Earth system models requires careful parameter calibration, which is computationally expensive and subject to equifinality. To explore alternative approaches, we present a deep neural network (DNN) scheme that surrogates the process-based wildfire model with the Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) interface. The DNN wildfire model accurately simulates observed burned area with over 90 % higher accuracy with a large reduction in parameterization time compared with the current process-based wildfire model. The surrogate wildfire model successfully captured the observed monthly regional burned area during validation period 2011 to 2015 (coefficient of determination, R2=0.93). Since the DNN wildfire model has the same input and output requirements as the E3SM process-based wildfire model, our results demonstrate the applicability of machine learning for high accuracy and efficient large-scale land model development and predictions.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-15-1899-2022,"",,

In this research, we assess the potential of different satellite data modalities (single-date, multi-date, multi-resolution, and an ensemble of multi-sensor images) for classifying land-use following deforestation in Ethiopia using the U-Net deep neural network architecture enhanced with attention. We performed the analysis on satellite image data retrieved across Ethiopia from freely available Landsat-8, Sentinel-2 and Planet-NICFI satellite data. The experiments aimed at an analysis of (a) single-date images from individual sensors to account for the differences in spatial resolution between image sensors in detecting land-uses, (b) ensembles of multiple images from different sensors (Planet-NICFI/Sentinel-2/Landsat-8) with different spatial resolutions, (c) the use of multi-date data to account for the contribution of temporal information in detecting land-uses, and, finally, (d) the identification of regional differences in terms of land-use following deforestation in Ethiopia. We hypothesize that choosing the right satellite imagery (sensor) type is crucial for the task. Based on a comprehensive visually interpreted reference dataset of 11 types of post-deforestation land-uses, we find that either detailed spatial patterns (single-date Planet-NICFI) or detailed temporal patterns (multi-date Sentinel-2, Landsat-8) are required for identifying land-use following deforestation, while medium-resolution single-date imagery is not sufficient to achieve high classification accuracy. We also find that adding soft-attention to the standard U-Net improved the classification accuracy, especially for small-scale land-uses. The models and products presented in this work can be used as a powerful data resource for governmental and forest monitoring agencies to design and monitor deforestation mitigation measures and data-driven land-use policy.","",https://doi.org/10.1080/15481603.2022.2115619,"",,

This biome has experienced land use and land cover changes at high rates due to agricultural expansion so that more than 50% of its natural vegetation has already been removed. Therefore, it is crucial to provide technology capable of controlling and monitoring the Cerrado vegetation suppression in order to undertake the environmental conservation policies. Within this context, this work aims to develop a new methodology to detect deforestation in Cerrado through the combination of two Deep Learning (DL) architectures, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and U-Net, and using Landsat and Sentinel image time series. In our proposed method, the LSTM evaluates the time series in relation to the time axis to create a deforestation probability map, which is spatially analyzed by the U-Net algorithm alongside the terrain slope to produce final deforestation maps. The method was applied in two different study areas, which better represent the main deforestation patterns present in Cerrado. The resultant deforestation maps based on cost-free Sentinel-2 images achieved high accuracy metrics, peaking at an overall accuracy of 99.81%±0.21 and F1-Score of 0.8795±0.1180. In addition, the proposed method showed strong potential to automate the PRODES project, which provides the official Cerrado yearly deforestation maps based on visual interpretation.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/rs14010209,"",,
rayyan-220225200,Deep Learning for Verification of Earth-System Parametrisation of Water Bodies,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract. About 2/3 of all densely populated areas (i.e. at least 300 inhabitants per km2) around the globe are situated within a 9 km radius of a permanent waterbody (i.e. inland water or sea/ocean coast), since inland water sustains the vast majority of human activities. Water bodies exchange mass and energy with the atmosphere and need to be accurately simulated in numerical weather prediction and climate modelling as they strongly influence the lower boundary conditions such as skin temperatures, turbulent latent and sensible heat fluxes and moisture availability near the surface. All the non-ocean water (resolved and sub-grid lakes and coastal waters) are represented in the Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) model, by the Fresh-water Lake (FLake) parametrisation, which treats ~1/3 of the land. It is a continuous enterprise to update the surface parametrization schemes and their input fields to better represent small-scale processes. It is, however, difficult to quickly determine both the accuracy of an updated parametrisation, and the added value gained for the purposes of numerical modelling. The aim of our work is to quickly and automatically assess the benefits of an updated lake parametrisation making use of a neural network regression model trained to simulate satellite observed surface skin temperatures. We deploy this tool to determine the accuracy of recent upgrades to the FLake parametrisation, namely the improved permanent lake cover and the capacity to represent seasonally varying water bodies (i.e. ephemeral lakes). We show that for grid-cells where the lake fields have been updated, the prediction accuracy in the land surface temperature improves by 0.45 K on average, whilst for the subset of points where the lakes have been exchanged for bare ground (or vice versa) the improvement is 1.12 K. We also show that updates to the glacier cover improve further the prediction accuracy by 0.14 K. The inclusion of seasonal water is shown to be particularly effective for grid points which are highly time variable, generally improving the simulation accuracy by ~1 K. The neural network regression model has proven to be useful and easily adaptable to assess unforeseen impacts of ancillary datasets, also detecting inappropriate changes of high vegetation to bare ground, which would lead to decreased the skin temperature simulation accuracy by 0.49 K, proving to be a valuable support to model development.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2022-1177,"",,

Two spectral images by Landsat 8 were applied to train and test the machine learning model. Feed forward neural network classifier was utilized as the machine learning model in which two evolutionary algorithms including particle swarm optimization and invasive weed optimization were applied for the training process. Moreover, three conventional training methods including Levenberg–Marquardt back propagation (LM), Scaled conjugate gradient backpropagation (SCG) and BFGS quasi-Newton backpropagation (BFG) were used for comparing the robustness and reliability of the evolutionary algorithms. Based on the results in the case study, evolutionary algorithms are not a reliable method for detecting changes through the remote sensing analysis in terms of accuracy and computational complexities. Either BFG or LM is the best method to detect the agricultural lands in the present study. BFG is slightly more robust than the LM method. However, LM might be preferred for applying in the projects due to low computational complexities.","",https://doi.org/10.1007/s10708-022-10678-5,"",,

The Carpathian Basin is extremely affected by fast-changing weather conditions during the year. IEW (sometimes referred to as water logging) is formed when, due to limited runoff, infiltration, and evaporation, surplus water remains on the surface or in places where groundwater flowing to lower areas appears on the surface by leaking through porous soil. In this study, eight different machine learning approaches were applied to derive IEW inundations on three different dates in 2021 (23 February, 7 March, 20 March). Index-based approaches are simple and provide relatively good results, but they need to be adapted to specific circumstances for each area and date.

The objective of this work was to develop a geographic model to identify the main patterns of LULC transitions between the years 2000 and 2018, to simulate a baseline scenario for the year 2036, and to assess the effectiveness of the Chapecó River ecological corridor (an area created by State Decree No. 2.957/2010), regarding the recovery and conservation of forest remnants and natural fields. The results indicate that the forest remnants have tended to recover their area, systematically replacing silviculture areas. However, natural fields (grassland) are expected to disappear in the near future if proper measures are not taken to protect this ecosystem.

rayyan-220225322,Predicting Species and Structural Diversity of Temperate Forests with Satellite Remote Sensing and Deep Learning,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Anthropogenically-driven climate change, land-use changes, and related biodiversity losses are threatening the capability of forests to provide a variety of valuable ecosystem services. The magnitude and diversity of these services are governed by tree species richness and structural complexity as essential regulators of forest biodiversity. Sound conservation and sustainable management strategies rely on information from biodiversity indicators that is conventionally derived by field-based, periodical inventory campaigns. However, these data are usually site-specific and not spatially explicit, hampering their use for large-scale monitoring applications. Therefore, the main objective of our study was to build a robust method for spatially explicit modeling of biodiversity variables across temperate forest types using open-access satellite data and deep learning models. Field data were obtained from the Biodiversity Exploratories, a research infrastructure platform that supports ecological research in Germany. A total of 150 forest plots were sampled between 2014 and 2018, covering a broad range of environmental and forest management gradients across Germany. From field data, we derived key indicators of tree species diversity (Shannon Wiener Index) and structural heterogeneity (standard deviation of tree diameter) as proxies of forest biodiversity. Deep neural networks were used to predict the selected biodiversity variables based on Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 images from 2017. Predictions of tree diameter variation achieved good accuracy (r2 = 0.51) using Sentinel-1 winter-based backscatter data. The best models of species diversity used a set of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 features but achieved lower accuracies (r2 = 0.25). Our results demonstrate the potential of deep learning and satellite remote sensing to predict forest parameters across a broad range of environmental and management gradients at the landscape scale, in contrast to most studies that focus on very homogeneous settings. These highly generalizable and spatially continuous models can be used for monitoring ecosystem status and functions, contributing to sustainable management practices, and answering complex ecological questions.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/rs14071631,"",,
rayyan-220225326,Using deep learning to classify grassland management intensity in ground-level photographs for more automated production of satellite land use maps,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Collecting accurate reference data for training and validating remotely sensed land use/land cover (LULC) maps is important. Financial and logistical constraints on projects mean it may not be possible to collect field data. Automated photo recognition methods using deep learning are increasingly being used for mapping land cover (the physical surface at a location). Their use in mapping land use (how the surface is used) is less well developed. This study explores an approach of using geotagged ground-level photographs to identify management intensity on agricultural grasslands. Management intensity on grasslands has implications for soil and water quality, biodiversity and habitat loss, and carbon fluxes. Uncertainty in the level of management intensity occurring at field scale is a source of error in greenhouse gas emission estimates from grasslands. Our study uses convolutional neural networks (CNN) to automate the labelling of unseen images into three management classes (intensive, extensive, abandoned). Ground-level photographs were taken during the 2018 EUROSTAT Land Use/Coverage Area Frame Survey (LUCAS). Accuracy up to 92.8% was achieved. Predicted labels were used to train a management intensity map using Sentinel 1 and Sentinel 2 satellite imagery. Overall accuracy for a random forest (RF) classification was 84.8% (64.8% after class imbalance was accounted for). Potential improvements to both the CNN and RF models are discussed. This study demonstrates the potential of CNN for classifying grassland use from geotagged photographs as part of automated LULC mapping workflows.","",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rsase.2022.100741,"",,

Three multi-class classification convolutional neural network (CNN) models were generated, showing F1-score values as high as 0.9 in only six epochs of training. Mangrove forests are tropical and subtropical environments that provide essential ecosystem services to local biota and coastal communities and are considered the most efficient vegetative carbon stock globally. Despite their importance, mangrove forest cover continues to decline worldwide, especially in SEA. Scientists have produced monitoring tools based on SRSI and CNNs to identify deforestation hotspots and drive targeted interventions. Nevertheless, although CNNs excel in distinguishing between different landcover types, their greatest limitation remains the need for significant computing power to operate. This may not always be feasible, especially in developing countries. The proposed framework is believed to provide a robust, low-cost, cloud-based, near-real-time monitoring tool that could serve governments, environmental agencies, and researchers, to help map mangroves in SEA.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/rs14102291,"",,

Unoccupied aerial systems (UASs) provide the advantage of flexible and rapid data acquisition at low cost compared to conventional platforms, such as satellite and airborne systems. UASs are often equipped with high spatial resolution cameras and/or light detection and ranging (LiDAR). However, the high spatial resolution imagery has a high information content, which makes land cover classification quite challenging. Recently, deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) have been effectively applied to remote sensing applications, which overcome the drawback of traditional techniques. In this research, a low-cost UAV-based multi-sensor data fusion model was developed for land cover classification based on a DCNN. For the purpose of this research, two datasets were collected at two different urban locations using two different UASs. A DCNN model, based on U-net with Resnet101 as a backbone, was used to train and test the fused image/LiDAR data. The maximum likelihood and support vector machine techniques were used as a reference for classifier comparison. It was shown that the proposed DCNN approach improved the overall accuracy of land cover classification for the first dataset by 15% compared to the reference classifiers. In addition, the overall accuracy of land cover classification improved by 7%, and the precision, recall, and F-measure improved by 18% when the fused image/LiDAR data were used compared to the images only. The trained DCNN model was also tested on the second dataset, and the obtained results were largely similar to those of the first dataset.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/rs14174298,"",,
rayyan-220225341,Assessing the effect of human activities on biophony in urban forests using an automated acoustic scene classification model,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Monitoring biodiversity and assessing the impact of human activities using acoustics is a promising area in the field of urban ecology. Previous studies on urban biodiversity using acoustics are often limited by data continuity and survey scope, making it difficult to answer questions about relationships between bird population dynamics and environmental factors. To some extent, big data methods such as continuous acoustic monitoring have bridged this gap and provided new research paths to address the problem. In this study, we proposed a machine learning (ML) method that uses convolutional neural networks (CNN) and target sound area ratios (TSAR) to quantify the dominance of seven types of acoustic scenes. Acoustic data was recorded at nine sites in three urban forests in Guangzhou, China. Using the site-related sound data, we trained the convolutional neural network and identified seven target soundscape components with an overall F1 score of 0.97, a precision of 0.96, and a recall of 0.97. Spatial patterns of acoustic scenes in urban forests were examined to understand the effective working radius of monitoring equipment and the impacts of differing land use types on the composition of soundscapes. This study indicates significant interactions between human activities and biodiversity using acoustics, demonstrates that vocal organisms respond to environmental changes primarily by changes in their vocal frequencies, and proposes a novel framework for utilizing acoustics to monitor urban biodiversity. Going forth, these analyses help to promote the conservation of biodiversity and the sustainability of urban development.","",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2022.109437,"",,

Land use classification was performed using Landsat 7 and Landsat 8 imageries of the years 2000 and 2020; then, cellular automata and artificial neural network (CA-ANN) modeling was conducted to predict the land use map of 2040. Carbon sequestration and the economic valuation were estimated using the land use maps of the past, present, and future (2000, 2020, and 2040) within the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystems Trade-off (InVEST) model. The results showed that deforestation occurred during the past two decades, and the forest area was predicted to keep decreasing in 2040, with the major contribution from the conversion to the agricultural area. Local communities’ perceptions confirmed that the forest conversion to croplands would persist due to the demand for fertile lands. This study estimated a loss of −7.337 megatonnes of forest carbon (Mt C) with an economic loss of USD −1369.38 million during 2000–2020 due to deforestation. If the business-as-usual scenario does not change in the near future, a potential carbon loss of −7.959 Mt C is predicted in the upcoming 20 years. The predicted results can be used to assist as a reference in establishing a national baseline and reference level for implementing the REDD+ mechanism in Fiji and sustainably managing the limited pristine forest by implementing forest-related programs.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/land11081274,"",,

This study applies a framework using remote sensing data and digital soil mapping techniques to examine the spatiotemporal dynamics of SOC for the Yazd-Ardakan Plain, Iran, from 1986 to 2016. Here, a conditioned Latin hypercube sampling method was used to select 201 sampling sites. A set of 37 environmental predictors were obtained from Landsat imagery taken in 1986, 1999, 2010 and 2016. Here, SOC was modeled for 2016 using the Random Forest (RF), support vector regression (SVR), and artificial neural networks (ANN) machine-learners by correlating environmental predictors with soil data. The results showed that RF yielded the highest accuracy (R2 = 0.53), compared to the other two learners. By performing a variable importance analysis of the RF model, normalized difference vegetation index, modified vegetation index, and ground-adjusted vegetation index were determined to be the most important environmental predictors. By applying the model calibrated from 2016 data to 1986, 1999 and 2010, the results showed a substantial decrease in SOC; these decreases in SOC were mainly attributed to land use changes and agricultural activities.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/agronomy12030628,"",,

Satellite remote sensing technology can collect large-scale, high-resolution ocean observation data, but only at the surface layer. Based on empirical statistical and artificial intelligence models, deep ocean remote sensing techniques allow us to retrieve and reconstruct the 3D ocean temperature structure by combining surface remote sensing observations with in situ float observations. This study proposed a new deep learning method, Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM) neural networks, which combines multisource remote sensing observations and Argo gridded data to reconstruct and produce a new long-time-series global ocean subsurface temperature (ST) dataset for the upper 2000 m from 1993 to 2020, which is named the Deep Ocean Remote Sensing (DORS) product. The data-driven ConvLSTM model can learn the spatiotemporal features of ocean observation data, significantly improves the model’s robustness and generalization ability, and outperforms the LighGBM model for the data reconstruction. The validation results show our DORS dataset has high accuracy with an average R2 and RMSE of 0.99/0.34 °C compared to the Argo gridded dataset, and the average R2 and NRMSE validated by the EN4-Profile dataset over the time series are 0.94/0.05 °C. Furthermore, the ST structure between DORS and Argo has good consistency in the 3D spatial morphology and distribution pattern, indicating that the DORS dataset has high quality and strong reliability, and well fills the pre-Argo data gaps. We effectively track the global ocean warming in the upper 2000 m from 1993 to 2020 based on the DORS dataset, and we further examine and understand the spatial patterns, evolution trends, and vertical characteristics of global ST changes. From 1993 to 2020, the average global ocean temperature warming trend is 0.063 °C/decade for the upper 2000 m. The 3D temperature trends revealed significant spatial heterogeneity across different ocean basins. Since 2005, the warming signal has become more significant in the subsurface and deeper ocean. From a remote sensing standpoint, the DORS product can provide new and robust data support for ocean interior process and climate change studies.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/rs14133198,"",,

The notable difference in spectral reflectance that occurs following deforestation allows land cover change to be detected with relative accuracy. Less progress has been made in detecting change in low productivity or disturbance-prone vegetation such as grasslands and shrublands where natural dynamics can be difficult to distinguish from habitat loss. Renosterveld is a hyperdiverse, critically endangered shrubland ecosystem in South Africa with less than 5–10% of its original extent remaining in small, highly fragmented patches. I demonstrate that classification of satellite image time series using neural networks can accurately detect the transformation of Renosterveld within a few days of its occurrence and that trained models are suitable for operational continuous monitoring. A dataset of precisely dated vegetation change events between 2016 and 2021 was obtained from daily, high resolution Planet Labs satellite data. This dataset was then used to train 1D convolutional neural networks and Transformers to continuously detect land cover change events in time series of vegetation activity from Sentinel 2 satellite data. The best model correctly identified 89% of land cover change events at the pixel-level, achieving a f-score of 0.93, a 79% improvement over the f-score of 0.52 achieved using a method designed for forested ecosystems based on trend analysis. Models have been deployed to operational use and are producing updated detections of habitat loss every 10 days. There is great potential for continuous monitoring of habitat loss in non-forest ecosystems with complex natural dynamics. A key limiting step is the development of accurately dated datasets of land cover change events with which to train machine-learning classifiers.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/rs14122766,"",,
rayyan-220225390,Deep Learning on Synthetic Data Enables the Automatic Identification of Deficient Forested Windbreaks in the Paraguayan Chaco,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"The Paraguayan Chaco is one of the most rapidly deforested areas in Latin America, mainly due to cattle ranching. Continuously forested windbreaks between agricultural areas and forest patches within these areas are mandatory to minimise the impact that the legally permitted logging has on the ecosystem. Due to the large area of the Paraguayan Chaco, comprehensive in situ monitoring of the integrity of these landscape elements is almost impossible. Satellite-based remote sensing offers excellent prerequisites for large-scale land cover analyses. However, traditional methods mostly focus on spectral and texture information while dismissing the geometric context of landscape features. Since the contextual information is very important for the identification of windbreak gaps and central forests, a deep learning-based detection of relevant landscape features in satellite imagery could solve the problem. However, deep learning methods require a large amount of labelled training data, which cannot be collected in sufficient quantity in the investigated area. This study presents a methodology to automatically classify gaps in windbreaks and central forest patches using a convolutional neural network (CNN) entirely trained on synthetic imagery. In a two-step approach, we first used a random forest (RF) classifier to derive a binary forest mask from Sentinel-1 and -2 images for the Paraguayan Chaco in 2020 with a spatial resolution of 10 m. We then trained a CNN on a synthetic data set consisting of purely artificial binary images to classify central forest patches and gaps in windbreaks in the forest mask. For both classes, the CNN achieved an F1 value of over 70%. The presented method is among the first to use synthetically generated training images and class labels to classify natural landscape elements in remote sensing imagery and therewith particularly contributes to the research on the detection of natural objects such as windbreaks.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/rs14174327,"",,

However, there is still a lack of research on using machine learning, especially one-dimensional convolutional neural networks (CNN)s, and soil-forming factors to classify the salinization and alkalization degree. As a case study, the study estimated the soil salination and alkalization by Random forests (RF) and CNN based on the 88 observations and 16 environmental covariates in Da’an city, China. The results show that: the RF model (accuracy = 0.67, precision = 0.67 for soil salination) with the synthetic minority oversampling technique performed better than CNN. Salinity and vegetation spectral indexes played the most crucial roles in soil salinization and alkalinization estimation in Songnen Plain. The spatial distribution derived from the RF model shows that from the 1980s to 2021, soil salinization and alkalization areas increased at an annual rate of 1.40% and 0.86%, respectively, and the size of very high salinization and alkalization was expanding.

Most of the region, typically monitored with optical sensors, is hidden by a persistent cloud cover for most of the wet season. The necessity for a consistent and reliable deforestation warning system based on cloud-independent radar data is therefore of particular interest. In this paper, we investigated the potential of combining deep learning with Sentinel-1 (S-1) Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) short time series (STS), covering only 24 d of acquisitions, to map endangered areas in the Amazon Basin. To this end, we implemented a U-Net-like convolutional neural network (CNN) for multi-layer semantic segmentation, trained from scratch with different sets of input features to evaluate the viability of the proposed approach for different operating conditions. As input features, we relied on both multi-temporal backscatter and interferometric coherences at different temporal baselines. We provide a detailed performance benchmark of the different configurations, also considering the current state-of-the-art approaches based on S-1 STS and shallow learners. Our findings showed that, by exploiting the powerful learning capabilities of CNNs, we outperformed the STS-based approaches published in the literature and significantly reduced the computational load. Indeed, when considering the entire stack of Sentinel-1 data at a 6 d revisit time, we were able to maintain the overall accuracy and F1-score well above 90% and reduce the computational time by more than 50% with respect to state-of-the-art approaches, by avoiding the generation of handcrafted feature maps.

Taking the urban areas of Wuhan, a typical rapid urbanizing region in China, as the study area, this study built a Markov chain-artificial neural network (ANN)-cellular automaton (CA) coupled model. The model used land use classification spatial data with a spatial resolution of 5 m in 2010 and 2020, obtained by remote sensing image interpretation, and data on natural and socio-economic driving forces for land use change simulation. Using the coupled model, the land use patterns of Wuhan urban areas in 2020 were simulated, which were validated in comparison with the actual land use data in 2020. Finally, the model was used to simulate the land uses in the study area in 2030. The model validation indicates that the land use change simulation has a high accuracy of 90.7% and a high kappa coefficient of 0.87. The simulated land uses of the urban areas of Wuhan show that artificial surfaces will continue to expand, with an area increase of approximately 7% from 2020 to 2030.

This program also provides daily data of active fire (fires spots) from a methodology that uses MODIS (Aqua and Terra) sensor data as reference satellites, which presents limitations mainly when dealing with small active fires. Remote sensing researches on active fire dynamics have contributed to wildfire comprehension, despite generally applying low spatial resolution data. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) associated with high- and medium-resolution remote sensing data may provide a complementary strategy to small active fire detection. We propose an approach based on object detection methods to map active fire in the Pantanal. In this approach, a post-processing strategy is adopted based on Non-Max Suppression (NMS) to reduce the number of highly overlapped detections. Extensive experiments were conducted, generating 150 models, as five-folds were considered. We generate a public dataset with 775-RGB image patches from the Wide Field Imager (WFI) sensor onboard the China Brazil Earth Resources Satellite (CBERS) 4A.

Correctly identifying urban wetlands from remote sensing images is fundamental for developing appropriate management and protection plans. To overcome the semantic limitations of traditional pixel-level urban wetland classification techniques, we proposed an urban wetland identification framework based on an advanced scene-level classification scheme. First, the Sentinel-2 high-resolution multispectral image of Shenzhen was segmented into 320 m × 320 m square patches to generate sample datasets for classification. Next, twelve typical convolutional neural network (CNN) models were transformed for the comparison experiments. Finally, the model with the best performance was used to classify the wetland scenes in Shenzhen, and pattern and composition analyses were also implemented in the classification results. We found that the DenseNet121 model performed best in classifying urban wetland scenes, with overall accuracy (OA) and kappa values reaching 0.89 and 0.86, respectively.

It is acknowledged that climate change will persist and perhaps intensify in the future, and it is thus meaningful to explore the quantitative impacts of these changes on hydrological regimes. The Jiulong River basin serves as an important watershed on the southeast coast of China. However, future hydrological changes under the combined impacts of climate change and land use change have been barely investigated. In this study, the climate outputs from five general circulation models (GCMs) under the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) were corrected and spatially downscaled by a statistical downscaling method combining quantile mapping and machine learning. The future high-resolution land use maps were projected by the CA–Markov model with land use changes from the Land-Use Harmonization 2 (LUH2) as constraints. The future dynamic vegetation process was projected by the Biome-GBC model, and then, the future hydrological process under four representative concentration pathways and shared socioeconomic pathways (RCP–SSP) combined scenarios was simulated by a distributed hydrological model. Based on the copula method, the flood frequency and corresponding return periods were derived. The results demonstrated that future precipitation and air temperature would continue to rise, and future land use changes would have different developing pathways determined by the designs in various SSP–RCPs. Under the combined impacts of climate and land use change, the total available water resources will increase due to increasing precipitation, and the high flow and low flow will both increase at three stations under the four SSP–RCPs. The annual 1-day maximum discharge is projected to increase by 67–133% in the last decade of the 21st century, and the annual 7-day minimum discharge is projected to increase by 19–39%. The flood frequency analysis showed that the Jiulong River basin would face more frequent floods in the future. By the end of the 21st century, the station-average frequency of a historical 100-year flood will increase by 122% under the most optimistic scenario (SSP126) and increase by 213% under the scenario of greatest regional rivalry (SSP370). We demonstrated that climate change would be the major cause for the increase in future high flows and that land use change would dominate future changes in low flows.

Airborne and spaceborne platforms are the primary data sources for large-scale forest mapping, but visual interpretation for individual species determination is labour-intensive. Hence, various studies focusing on forests have investigated the benefits of multiple sensors for automated tree species classification. However, transferable deep learning approaches for large-scale applications are still lacking. This gap motivated us to create a novel dataset for tree species classification in Central Europe based on multi-sensor data from aerial, Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 imagery. In this paper, we introduce the TreeSatAI Benchmark Archive, which contains labels of 20 European tree species (i.e., 15 tree genera) derived from forest administration data of the federal state of Lower Saxony, Germany. We propose models and guidelines for the application of the latest machine learning techniques for the task of tree species classification with multi-label data. Finally, we provide various benchmark experiments showcasing the information which can be derived from the different sensors including artificial neural networks and tree-based machine learning methods. We found that residual neural networks (ResNet) perform sufficiently well with weighted precision scores up to 79 % only by using the RGB bands of aerial imagery. This result indicates that the spatial content present within the 0.2 m resolution data is very informative for tree species classification. With the incorporation of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 imagery, performance improved marginally. However, the sole use of Sentinel-2 still allows for weighted precision scores of up to 74 % using either multi-layer perceptron (MLP) or Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) models. Since the dataset is derived from real-world reference data, it contains high class imbalances. We found that this dataset attribute negatively affects the models' performances for many of the underrepresented classes (i.e., scarce tree species). However, the class-wise precision of the best performing late fusion model still reached values ranging from 54 % (Acer) to 88 % (Pinus). Based on our results, we conclude that deep learning techniques using aerial imagery could considerably support forestry administration in the provision of large-scale tree species maps at a very high resolution to plan for challenges driven by global environmental change.

It represents more than half of the remaining tropical forest on Earth and covers the catchment basin of the Amazon river on which 20% of the surface fresh water on the planet flows. Such an ecosystem produces large quantities of water vapor, helping regulate rainfall regimes in most of South America, with strong economic implications: for instance, by irrigating crops and pastures, and supplying water for the main hydroelectric plants in the continent. Being the natural habitat of one-tenth of the currently known species, the Amazon also has enormous biotechnological potential. Among the major menaces to the Amazon is the extension of agricultural and cattle farming, forest fires, illegal mining and logging, all directly associated with deforestation. Preserving the Amazon is obviously essential, and it is well-known that remote sensing provides effective tools for environmental monitoring. This work presents a deforestation detection approach based on the DeepLabv3+, a fully convolutional deep learning model devised for semantic segmentation. The proposed method extends the original DeepLabv3+ model, aiming at properly dealing with a strong class imbalanced problem and improving the delineation quality of deforestation polygons. Experiments were devised to evaluate the proposed method in terms of the sensitivity to the weighted focal loss hyperparameters—through an extensive grid search—and the amount of training data, and compared its performance to previous deep learning methods proposed for deforestation detection. Landsat OLI-8 images of a specific region in the Amazon were used in such evaluation. The results indicate that the variants of the proposed method outperformed previous works in terms of the F1-score and Precision metrics. Additionally, more substantial performance gains were observed in the context of smaller volumes of training data. When the evaluated methods were trained using four image tiles, the proposed method outperformed its counterparts by approximately +10% in terms of F1-score (from 63% to 73%); when the methods were trained with only one image tile, the performance difference in terms of F1-score achieved approximately +18% (from 49% to 67%).","",https://doi.org/10.3390/rs14194694,"",,
rayyan-220225456,High-Performance Segmentation for Flood Mapping of HISEA-1 SAR Remote Sensing Images,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Floods are the among the most frequent and common natural disasters, causing numerous casualties and extensive property losses worldwide every year. Since flooding areas are often accompanied by cloudy and rainy weather, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is one of the most powerful sensors for flood monitoring with capabilities of day-and-night and all-weather imaging. However, SAR images are prone to high speckle noise, shadows, and distortions, which affect the accuracy of water body segmentation. To address this issue, we propose a novel Modified DeepLabv3+ model based on the powerful extraction ability of convolutional neural networks for flood mapping from HISEA-1 SAR remote sensing images. Specifically, a lightweight encoder MobileNetv2 is used to improve floodwater detection efficiency, small jagged arrangement atrous convolutions are employed to capture features at small scales and improve pixel utilization, and more upsampling layers are utilized to refine the segmented boundaries of water bodies. The Modified DeepLabv3+ model is then used to analyze two severe flooding events in China and the United States. Results show that Modified DeepLabv3+ outperforms competing semantic segmentation models (SegNet, U-Net, and DeepLabv3+) with respect to the accuracy and efficiency of floodwater extraction. The modified model training resulted in average accuracy, F1, and mIoU scores of 95.74%, 89.31%, and 87.79%, respectively. Further analysis also revealed that Modified DeepLabv3+ is able to accurately distinguish water feature shape and boundary, despite complicated background conditions, while also retaining the highest efficiency by covering 1140 km2 in 5 min. These results demonstrate that this model is a valuable tool for flood monitoring and emergency management.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/rs14215504,"",,

Here we use temporal convolutional neural networks (TempCNNs) to generate a spatiotemporally consistent LCLUC data set for nearly thirty-five years (1982–2015), validated against two reference data sets with over 80 percent accuracy, better than other LCLUC products for the region. Our results both confirm and complicate estimates from earlier work that relied on decadal, rather than interannual, changes in regional land cover. We find forests decrease in mainland and maritime Southeast Asia and increase in South China and South Asia. Consistent with geographic theory about the drivers of land-use change, we find cropland expansion is a driving force for deforestation in mainland Southeast Asia with savannas playing a superior role, suggesting widespread forest degradation in this region. In contrast to earlier work and theory, we find that South China's increasing forest cover comes principally from savanna (rather than cropland) conversion. The explicit interannual LCLUC patterns, rates, and transitions identified in this study provide a valuable data source for studies of land-use theory, environmental and climate changes, and regional land-use policy evaluations.","",https://doi.org/10.1080/24694452.2022.2077168,"",,

Low spatial representativeness limits gauge measurements of rainfall and low spatial resolution limits satellite-derived rainfall. SM2RAIN-based products, which exploit the inversion of the water balance equation to derive rainfall from soil moisture (SM) observations, can be an alternative. However, the quality of SM data limits the accuracy of rainfall. The goal of this work was to improve the accuracy of rainfall estimation through merging multiple soil moisture (SM) datasets. This study proposed an integration framework, which consists of multiple machine learning methods, to use satellite and ground-based soil moisture observations to derive a precipitation product. First, three machine learning (ML) methods (random forest (RF), long short-term memory (LSTM), and convolutional neural network (CNN)) were used, respectively to generate three SM datasets (RF-SM, LSTM-SM, and CNN-SM) by merging satellite (SMOS, SMAP, and ASCAT) and ground-based SM observations. Then, these SM datasets were merged using the Bayesian model averaging method and validated by wireless sensor network (WSN) observations. Finally, the merged SM data were used to produce a rainfall dataset (SM2R) using SM2RAIN. The SM2R dataset was validated using automatic meteorological station (AMS) rainfall observations recorded throughout the Upper Heihe River Basin (China) during 2014–2015 and compared with other rainfall datasets. Our results revealed that the quality of the SM2R data outperforms that of GPM-SM2RAIN, Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station data (CHIRPS), ERA5-Land (ERA5) and multi-source weighted-ensemble Precipitation (MSWEP). Triple-collocation analysis revealed that SM2R outperformed China Meteorological Data and the China Meteorological Forcing Dataset.

This article assessed the past changes of LULC in the Mono River catchment using Landsat images from the years 1986, 2000, 2010, and 2020 by performing Machine Learning Classification Method Random Forest (RF) technique, and using Markov chain method and stakeholder’s perspective to simulate future LULC changes for the years 2030 and 2050. LULC was classified as savanna, cropland, forest, water bodies, and settlement. The results showed that croplands and forests areas declined from 2020 to 2050 with decreases of −7.8% and −1.9%, respectively, a modest increase in settlement (1.3%), and savanna was the dominant LULC in the study region with an increase of 8.5%. From stakeholders’ perspective, rapid population growth, deforestation, rainfall variability/flood, urbanization, and agricultural expansion were the most important drivers associated with the observed LULC changes in the area. Other factors, such as lack of political commitment, distance to river, and elevation were also mentioned. Additionally, most the land-use scenarios identified by stakeholders would intensify land degradation and reduce ecosystem services in the area. By considering all of these potential LULC changes, decision-makers need to develop and implement appropriate solutions (e.g., land use planning strategies, reforestation campaigns, forest protection measures) in order to limit the negative effects of future LULC changes.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/su14074160,"",,

One of the most invasive species on Earth is the water hyacinth. These plants are harmful to biodiversity and create negative impacts on society and economy. The Guadiana river (one of the most important ones in Spain) has suffered from this problem since the early 2000s. Several efforts have been made to mitigate it. However, invasive plants, such as the water hyacinth, are still present in seed banks at the bottom of the river and can germinate even more than a decade after. In this article, we propose an automatic methodology, based on remote sensing and deep learning techniques, to monitor the water hyacinth in the Guadiana river. Specifically, a multitemporal analysis was carried out during two years using images collected by ESA's Sentinel-2 satellite, analyzed with a convolutional neural network. We demonstrate that, with our strategy, the river can be monitored every few days, and we are able to automatically detect the water hyacinth. Three experiments have been carried out to predict the presence of water hyacinth from a few scattered training samples, which represent invasive plants in different phenological stages and with different spectral responses.","",https://doi.org/10.1109/jstars.2022.3225201,"",,

Seagrass monitoring by remote sensing have been conducted over past decades using satellite and aerial images, which have low resolution to analyze changes in the composition of different seagrass species in the meadows. Recently, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have allowed us to obtain much higher resolution images, which is promising in observing fine-scale changes in seagrass species composition. Furthermore, image processing techniques based on deep learning can be applied to the discrimination of seagrass species that were difficult based only on color variation. In this study, we conducted mapping of a multispecific seagrass bed in Saroma-ko Lagoon, Hokkaido, Japan, and compared the accuracy of the three discrimination methods of seagrass bed areas and species composition, i.e ., pixel-based classification, object-based classification, and the application of deep neural network. Methods We set five benthic classes, two seagrass species ( Zostera marina and Z. japonica ), brown and green macroalgae, and no vegetation for creating a benthic cover map. High-resolution images by UAV photography enabled us to produce a map at fine scales (&lt;1 cm resolution). Results The application of a deep neural network successfully classified the two seagrass species. The accuracy of seagrass bed classification was the highest (82%) when the deep neural network was applied. Conclusion Our results highlighted that a combination of UAV mapping and deep learning could help monitor the spatial extent of seagrass beds and classify their species composition at very fine scales.","",https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.14017,"",,

Reliable remote sensing solutions are required to assist their management and conservation at broad scale. Canopy gaps are part of forests' turnover and rejuvenation, but yet no method has been proposed to map their occurrence and recovery in mangroves. Here, were propose an approach based on a deep learning framework called Mask R‐CNN to achieve automatic detection and delineation of gaps using very‐high‐resolution satellite imagery (&lt;1 m). The Mask R‐CNN combines a series of neural network architectures to identify and delineate gaps, determine their recovery stage, and estimate their morphological attributes. The approach was tested on four mangroves from different regions of the globe with high concentration of gaps of various origins (lightning strikes, oil spills, cutting, pests). The Mask R‐CNN performed well to detect gaps, and accurately delineated gap contours (F1‐score of segmentation ≥0.89). The model also succeeded in distinguishing among five recovery stages of gaps, from their onset to closure (Overall Accuracy = 91.4, Kappa = 0.89). Accurate retrieval of gap area, eccentricity, and compactness – three relevant morphological attributes – were obtained ( R 2 ≥ 0.83, NRMSE ≤10%). Several sources of confusion and misdelineation were identified. Our approach shows promising transferability to other mangrove sites and optical sensors and could help monitor canopy recovery in mangroves. It also opens promising perspectives for identifying the origin of gaps (natural or human‐induced). It is intended to assist environmental managers and field experts in the management and conservation of these fragile ecosystems.","",https://doi.org/10.1002/rse2.289,"",,

It is of crucial importance to deal with such plants in aquatic ecosystems, since they can affect biodiversity and, ultimately, ecosystem function and services. In this study, it is intended to detect water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes) using multispectral data with different spatial resolutions. For this purpose, high-resolution data (&lt;0.1 m) acquired from an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and coarse-resolution data (10 m) from Sentinel-2 MSI were used. Three areas with a high incidence of water hyacinth located in the Lower Mondego region (Portugal) were surveyed. Different classifiers were used to perform a pixel-based detection of this invasive species in both datasets. From the different classifiers used, the results were achieved by the random forest classifiers stand-out (overall accuracy (OA): 0.94). On the other hand, support vector machine performed worst (OA: 0.87), followed by Gaussian naive Bayes (OA: 0.88), k-nearest neighbours (OA: 0.90), and artificial neural networks (OA: 0.91). The higher spatial resolution from UAV-based data enabled us to detect small amounts of water hyacinth, which could not be detected in Sentinel-2 data. However, and despite the coarser resolution, satellite data analysis enabled us to identify water hyacinth coverage, compared well with a UAV-based survey. Combining both datasets and even considering the different resolutions, it was possible to observe the temporal and spatial evolution of water hyacinth. This approach proved to be an effective way to assess the effects of the mitigation/control measures taken in the study areas. Thus, this approach can be applied to detect invasive species in aquatic environments and to monitor their changes over time.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/drones6020047,"",,

Meadows of this endemic seagrass species represent the largest carbon storage among seagrasses around the world, largely contributing to global blue carbon stocks. Yet, the slow growth of this temperate species and the extreme projected temperature and sea-level rise due to climate change increase the risk of reduction and loss of these services. Currently, there are knowledge gaps in its basin-wide spatially explicit extent and relevant accounting, therefore accurate and efficient mapping of its distribution and trajectories of change is needed. Here, we leveraged contemporary advances in Earth Observation—cloud computing, open satellite data, and machine learning—with field observations through a cloud-native geoprocessing framework to account the spatially explicit ecosystem extent of P. oceanica seagrass across its full bioregional scale. Employing 279,186 Sentinel-2 satellite images between 2015 and 2019, and a human-labeled training dataset of 62,928 pixels, we mapped 19,020 km 2 of P. oceanica meadows up to 25 m of depth in 22 Mediterranean countries, across a total seabed area of 56,783 km 2 . Using 2,480 independent, field-based points, we observe an overall accuracy of 72%. We include and discuss global and region-specific seagrass blue carbon stocks using our bioregional seagrass extent estimate. As reference data collections, remote sensing technology and biophysical modelling improve and coalesce, such spatial ecosystem extent accounts could further support physical and monetary accounting of seagrass condition and ecosystem services, like blue carbon and coastal biodiversity. We envisage that effective policy uptake of these holistic seagrass accounts in national climate strategies and financing could accelerate transparent natural climate solutions and coastal resilience, far beyond the physical location of seagrass beds.","",https://doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2022.871799,"",,

Assessments of the drivers of these changes have so far been focused on human activity on the subaerial delta plains. However, the fragile nature of deltaic ecosystems and the need for biodiversity conservation on a global scale require more accurate quantification of the footprint of anthropogenic activity across delta waterways. To address this need, we investigated the potential of deep learning and high spatiotemporal resolution satellite imagery to identify river vessels, using the Vietnamese Mekong Delta (VMD) as a focus area. We trained the Faster R-CNN Resnet101 model to detect two classes of objects: (i) vessels and (ii) clusters of vessels, and achieved high detection accuracies for both classes (f-score = 0.84-0.85). The model was subsequently applied to available PlanetScope imagery across 2018-2021; the resultant detections were used to generate monthly, seasonal and annual products mapping the riverine activity, termed here the Human Waterway Footprint (HWF), with which we showed how waterborne activity has increased in the VMD (from approx. 1650 active vessels in 2018 to 2070 in 2021 - a 25 % increase). Whilst HWF values correlated well with population density estimates (R2 = 0.59-0.61, p < 0.001), many riverine activity hotspots were located away from population centres and varied spatially across the investigated period, highlighting that more detailed information is needed to fully evaluate the extent, and type, of human footprint on waterways. High spatiotemporal resolution satellite imagery in combination with deep learning methods offers great promise for such monitoring, which can subsequently enable local and regional assessment of environmental impacts of anthropogenic activities on delta ecosystems around the globe.","",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.160363,"",,

In this work, we propose a method based on deep ensembles that densely estimates forest structure variables at country-scale with 10-m resolution, using freely available satellite imagery as input. Our method jointly transforms Sentinel-2 optical images and Sentinel-1 synthetic-aperture radar images into maps of five different forest structure variables: 95th height percentile, mean height, density, Gini coefficient, and fractional cover. We train and test our model on reference data from 41 airborne laser scanning missions across Norway and demonstrate that it is able to generalize to unseen test regions, achieving normalized mean absolute errors between 11% and 15%, depending on the variable. Our work is also the first to propose a variant of so-called Bayesian deep learning to densely predict multiple forest structure variables with well-calibrated uncertainty estimates from satellite imagery. The uncertainty information increases the trustworthiness of the model and its suitability for downstream tasks that require reliable confidence estimates as a basis for decision making.

Changes in biomass of mat-forming pale lichens have the potential to affect vegetation, fauna, climate and human activities including reindeer husbandry. Lichens have a complex spectral signature and terricolous lichens have limited growth height, often growing in mixtures with taller vegetation. This has, so far, prevented the development of remote sensing techniques to accurately assess lichen biomass, which would be a powerful tool in ecosystem and ecological research and rangeland management. We present a Landsat based remote sensing model developed using deep neural networks, trained with 8914 field records of lichen volume collected for >20 years. In contrast to earlier proposed machine learning and regression methods for lichens, our model exploited the ability of neural networks to handle mixed spatial resolution input. We trained candidate models using input of 1 × 1 (30 × 30 m) and 3 × 3 Landsat pixels based on 7 reflective bands and 3 indices, combined with a 10 m spatial resolution digital elevation model. We normalised elevation data locally for each plot to remove the region-specific variation, while maintaining informative local variation in topography. The final model predicted lichen volume in an evaluation set (n = 159) reaching an R2 of 0.57. NDVI and elevation were the most important predictors, followed by the green band. Even with moderate tree cover density, the model was efficient, offering a considerable improvement compared to earlier methods based on specific reflectance. The model was in principle trained on data from Scandinavia, but when applied to sites in North America and Russia, the predictions of the model corresponded well with our visual interpretations of lichen abundance. We also accurately quantified a recent historic (35 years) change in lichen abundance in northern Norway. This new method enables further spatial and temporal studies of variation and changes in lichen biomass related to multiple research questions as well as rangeland management and economic and cultural ecosystem services. Combined with information on changes in drivers such as climate, land use and management, and air pollution, our model can be used to provide accurate estimates of ecosystem changes and to improve vegetation-climate models by including pale lichens.","",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2022.113201,"",,

The present study investigated the spatio-temporal changes in Land Use Land Cover (LULC) in the Gorgan River Basin (GRB) during the 1990–2020 period and predicted the changes by 2040. First, a change analysis employing satellite imagery from 1990 to 2020 was carried out. Then, the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) technique was used to predict the transition potential. The accuracy rate, training RMS, and testing RMS of the artificial neural network, MLP, and the transition potential modeling were computed in order to evaluate the results. Utilizing projections for 2020, the prediction of land cover change was made. By contrasting the anticipated land cover map of 2020 with the actual land cover map of 2020, the accuracy of the model was evaluated. The LULC conditions in the future were predicted under two scenarios of the current change trend (scenario 1) and the ecological capability of the land (scenario 2) by 2040. Seven landscape metrics were considered, including Number of Patches, Patch Density, the Largest Patch Index, Edge Density, Landscape Shape Index, Patch Area, and Area-Weighted Mean Shape Index. Based on the Cramer coefficient, the most critical factors affecting LULC change were elevation, distance from forest, and experimental probability of change. For the 1990–2020 period, the LULC change was shown to be influenced by deforestation, reduced rangeland, and expansion of agricultural and residential areas. Based on scenario 1, the area of forest, agriculture, and rangeland would face −0.8, 0.5, and 0.1% changes in the total area, respectively. In scenario 2, the area of forest, agriculture, and rangeland would change by 0.1, −1.3, and 1.3% of the total area, respectively. Landscape metrics results indicated the destructive trend of the landscape during the 1990–2020 period. For improving the natural condition of the GRB, it is suggested to prioritize different areas in need of regeneration due to inappropriate LULC changes and take preventive and protective measures where changes in LULC were predicted in the future, taking into account land management conditions (scenario 2).","",https://doi.org/10.3390/su142013070,"",,

In this work, we analyze the impacts of elevated CO 2 (eCO 2 ) and land use change (LUC) on gross primary productivity (GPP) and evaporation in the southern Amazon (7°S 14°S, 66°W 51°W), which suffered strong anthropogenic influence in the period of 1981‒2010. We ran four dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs), isolating historical CO 2 , constant CO 2 , LUC, and potential natural vegetation scenarios with three climate variable data sets: precipitation, temperature, and shortwave radiation. We compared the outputs to five “observational” data sets obtained through eddy covariance, remote sensing, meteorological measurements, and machine learning. The results indicate that eCO 2 may have offset deforestation, with GPP increasing by ∼13.5% and 9.3% (dry and rainy seasons, respectively). After isolating the LUC effect, a reduction in evaporation of ∼4% and ∼1.2% (dry and rainy seasons, respectively) was observed. The analysis of forcings in subregions under strong anthropogenic impact revealed a reduction in precipitation of ∼15 and 30 mm, and a temperature rise of 1°C and 0.6°C (dry and rainy seasons, respectively). Differences in the implementation of plant physiology and leaf area index in the DGVMs introduced some uncertainties in the interpretation of the results. Nevertheless, we consider that it was an important exercise given the relevance.","",https://doi.org/10.1029/2021jd034608,"",,
rayyan-220225733,Coupling agricultural system models with machine learning to facilitate regional predictions of management practices and crop production,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract Process-based agricultural system models are a major tool for assessing climate-agriculture-management interactions. However, their application across large scales is limited by computational cost, model uncertainty, and data availability, hindering policy-making for sustainable agricultural production at the scale meaningful for land management by farmers. Using the Agricultural Production System sIMulator (APSIM) as an example model, the APSIM model was run for 101 years from 1980 to 2080 in a typical cropping region (i.e., the Huang-Huai-Hai plain) of China. Then, machine learning (ML)-based models were trained to emulate the performance of the APSIM model and used to map crop production and soil carbon (which is a key indicator of soil health and quality) dynamics under a great number of nitrogen and water management scenarios. We found that ML-based emulators can accurately and quickly reproduce APSIM predictions of crop yield and soil carbon dynamics across the region under different spatial resolutions, and capture main processes driving APSIM predictions with much less input data. In addition, the emulators can be easily and quickly applied to identify optimal nitrogen management to achieve yield potential and sequester soil carbon across the region. The approach can be used for modelling other complex systems and amplifying the usage of agricultural system models for guiding agricultural management strategies and policy-making to address global environmental challenges from agriculture intensification.","",https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/ac9c71,"",,
rayyan-220225750,"Multi-tier archetypes to characterise British landscapes, farmland and farming practices",,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract Due to rising demand for both food and environmental services, agriculture is increasingly required to deliver multiple outcomes. Characterising differences, across agricultural landscapes, via the identification of broad archetypal groupings, is an important step in exploring spatial patterns in the capacity of land to deliver these potentially competing functions. Creating characterisations at multiple levels, for landscape and farm management, can allow policy-makers and land managers to harmonise delivery of ecosystem services at different intervention scales. This can identify ways to increase the complementarity of public goods and the sustainability of farmed landscapes. We used data-driven machine learning to create landscape and agricultural management archetypes (1 km resolution) at three levels, defined by opportunities for adaptation. Tier 1 archetypes quantify broad differences in soil, land cover and population across Great Britain, which cannot be readily influenced by the actions of land managers; Tier 2 archetypes capture more nuanced variations within farmland-dominated landscapes of Great Britain, over which land managers may have some degree of influence. Tier 3 archetypes are built at national levels for England and Wales and focus on socioeconomic and agro-ecological characteristics within farmland-dominated landscapes, characterising differences in farm management. By using a non-nested hierarchy, we identified which types of management are restricted to certain landscape settings, and which are applicable across multiple landscape contexts. Understanding variation within and between agricultural landscapes and farming practices has implications for planning environmental sustainability and food security. It can also aid understanding of the scale at which interventions could be most effective, from incentivising changes in farmer behaviour to policy drivers of large-scale land use change.","",https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/ac810e,"",,
rayyan-220225754,Unsupervised Change Detection Using Convolutional-Autoencoder Multiresolution Features,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"The use of deep learning (DL) methods for change detection (CD) is currently dominated by supervised models that require a large number of labeled samples. However, these samples are difficult to acquire in the multitemporal case. A possible alternative is leveraging methods that exploit transfer learning for CD by reusing DL models pretrained for other tasks. However, the performance of the transfer-learning-based models decreases as much as the target images differ from the ones used for training the model. To overcome this limit, we propose an unsupervised CD method that exploits multiresolution deep feature maps derived by a convolutional autoencoder (CAE). It automatically learns spatial features from the input during the training phase without requiring any labeled data. The proposed method processes the bitemporal images to obtain and compare multiresolution bitemporal feature maps. These feature maps are then analyzed by a feature-selection technique to select the most discriminant ones. Furthermore, an aggregated multiresolution difference image is computed and used for a detail-preserving multiscale CD. In the context of this CD approach, we propose two alternative strategies to retrieve multiscale reliability maps. We tested the proposed method on bitemporal multispectral images acquired by Landsat-5 and Landsat-8 representing burned areas and Sentinel-2 images representing deforested areas. Results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed CD technique.","",https://doi.org/10.1109/tgrs.2022.3140404,"",,
rayyan-220225765,"Deep Learning Dataset for Estimating Burned Areas: Case Study, Indonesia",,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Wildland fire is one of the most causes of deforestation, and it has an important impact on atmospheric emissions, notably CO2. It occurs almost every year in Indonesia, especially during the dry season. Therefore, it is necessary to identify the burned areas from remote sensing images to establish the zoning map of areas prone to wildland fires. Many methods have been developed for mapping burned areas from low-resolution to medium-resolution satellite images. One of the popular approaches for mapping tasks is a deep learning approach using U-Net architecture. However, it needs a large amount of representative training data to develop the model. In this paper, we present a new dataset of burned areas in Indonesia for training or evaluating the U-Net model. We delineate burned areas manually by visual interpretation on Landsat-8 satellite images. The dataset is collected from some regions in Indonesia, and it consists of 227 images with a size of 512 × 512 pixels. It contains one or more burned scars or only the background and its labeled masks. The dataset can be used to train and evaluate the deep learning model for image detection, segmentation, and classification tasks related to burned area mapping.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/data7060078,"",,

Europe has seen what could be the most severe drought conditions to hit the continent for more than 500 years [1], with exceptionally low water levels impacting navigation of inland waterways and leaving insufficient cooling water for power plants. French fire fighters struggled with wildfires on a dramatic scale. The Yangtze River in China reached historically low levels. In the Western USA, the drought has broken previous records for the driest 22-year period in the region since the year 800 CE [2], depriving farmers of water and further impacting fragile ecosystems in the Colorado River basin. Examining these various manifestations of drought reveals a series of interlinked phenomena that are examined in this themed issue of the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society.First, it is clear that droughts are profoundly human-influenced, and we expect them to be even more so in the future. The title of this themed issue—Drought risk in the Anthropocene—reflects the recognition that the Earth System is human-influenced to an extent that we are said to be living in a new geological era [3]. Droughts are a manifestation of the Anthropocene in a number of different senses. As the paper by Vicente-Serano et al. (Global drought trends and future projections) [4] explains, greenhouse gas emissions are driving some of the conditions that are making droughts more severe. Human influences both warm the planet and intensify contrasts between wet and dry conditions, and drought has been impacted particularly by increased evaporation linked to warming. Human influences may also be implicated in circulation changes that are shifting the patterns of meteorological drought conditions. Marvel et al. (Using machine learning to identify novel hydroclimate states) [5] use a new combination of empirical data and machine learning methods to identify the increasing frequency of drought conditions in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries.Besides anthropogenic climatic changes, human activity has impacted the Earth's surface and catchments through land use change, urbanization and infrastructure construction. These changes have modified the ways in which meteorological droughts propagate into hydrological droughts. The expansion of irrigated agriculture and water use in cities and industries means that human water withdrawals are often the most significant drivers of water scarcity. Since the introduction of the concept of planetary boundaries by Rockström et al. in [6], there has been debate about whether human exploitation of fresh water is now so voluminous that a planetary boundary for water has already been exceeded. Pastor et al. (Understanding the transgression of global and regional freshwater planetary boundaries) [7] continue their investigation of this question, by examining water stress at regional as well as global scales.Second, the processes by which droughts materialize are extraordinarily complex. They vary enormously across space. Readers will obtain insights into the complexity of local processes by reading the basin-scale and regional analyses in this themed issue, including Mishra et al.'s article (Benchmark worst droughts during the summer monsoon in India) [8], which examines the severity of monsoon droughts, and Quentin Grafton et al.'s article (Resilience to Anthropogenic Drought in the Northern Murray-Darling Basin, Australia) [9], which adds to the important literature on the complex hydrology and contested water use in the Murray–Darling Basin. The paper by Murgatroyd et al. (Strategic analysis of the drought resilience of water supply systems) [10] illustrates the complexity of how meteorological droughts translate into hydrological droughts and water shortages for people. The interactions are influenced above all by human water management: storage, transfers and the allocation of water to different users. These papers illustrate the role of basin-scale and national-scale studies in understanding the complexity of droughts. Though there have been very impressive steps in global hydrology and water resource systems modelling over the last two decades, it has far from replaced the insights that can be gained from more local-scale studies that can mobilize much more data to expose the complexity of hydrological processes.Finally, droughts have multiple impacts and those impacts are profoundly modified by adaptation responses. Quentin Grafton et al.'s article examines the response of birds in the Murray-Darling Basin, which adds to ongoing debates in the literature on the ecological impacts of droughts. Ecosystems are naturally resilient to droughts, but when they are already degraded because of other anthropogenic impacts, extreme droughts may push ecosystems into a state from which they cannot recover—more research is required to establish under what conditions that hypothesis is true. This emphasizes the point that climate change needs to be viewed in the context of multiple stressors on the environment.Barbier's [11] review article on the economics of managing water crises examines the economic impacts of droughts and argues that misallocation of water is a consequence of inadequate pricing of scarce water resources. Few economists would argue with that assertion, though they may also point to the very rare instances of functioning water markets and question why the governance conditions to create such markets are so elusive.This themed issue documents important scientific advances that are improving understandings of droughts and the evidence needed for drought management. There have been rapid advances in drought forecasting, which are documented in the paper by AghaKouchak et al. (Status and prospects for drought forecasting: opportunities in artificial intelligence and hybrid physical-statistical forecasting) [12]. These advances have been enabled by a combination of new data sources, in particular from satellite Earth observation, and increasingly powerful methods to analyse these vast datasets, notably with machine learning (also employed by Marvel et al. [5] for analysis of climate data) and artificial intelligence. AghaKouchak et al. [12] demonstrate how physical insights can help to constrain and improve the performance of data-based methods. Increasing computational resources are enabling climatic, hydrological and water resource systems modelling on scales that were hitherto considered to be infeasible—for example the paper by Murgatroyd et al. [10] applies water resource system simulation modelling, driven by more than 9000 years of synthetic daily climate data to analyse water supply shortages on an unprecedented national scale. The paper by Goodwin et al. (The contribution of a catchment-scale advice network to successful agricultural drought adaptation in Northern Thailand) [13] reports on lessons learnt from social network analysis, applied to data gathered from an extensive on-the-ground survey of farmers, in guiding ways forward for improved adaptation to foster improved agricultural drought resilience in the region.As one would expect from the Chief Executive of England's Environment Agency (which has responsibility for regulating the water environment and drought planning), Sir James Bevan's concluding article (Drought risk in the Anthropocene: from the jaws of death to the waters of life) [14] focuses upon what can and should be done to manage drought risk. The article follows the speech by Sir James in 2019, which used the 'jaws of death' analogy to draw attention to the combined effects on future water shortages of increasing demand for water and climate-driven water scarcity. In his article for this themed issue, Sir James points out opportunities for a more drought-resilient future, which may be achieved through reductions in water consumption, strategic augmentations of supply and reallocating more water to the aquatic environment to build its resilience to climate-related shocks. Such an approach will need to be underpinned by a better scientific understanding of the causes and management of droughts, which this themed issue seeks to provide.Data accessibilityThis article has no additional data.Authors' contributionsJ.W.H.: writing—original draft; J.H.: writing—review and editing; G.H.: writing—review and editing.All authors gave final approval for publication and agreed to be held accountable for the work performed therein.Conflict of interest declarationThis theme issue was put together by the Guest Editor team under supervision from the journal's Editorial staff, following the Royal Society's ethical codes and best-practice guidelines.

Satellite remote sensing provides global precipitation estimates (including coastal land/ocean). While these datasets have been extensively evaluated over land, they have rarely been assessed over coastal ocean. As precipitation radars cover both coastal land and ocean, we used the Multi-Radar/Multi-Sensor System (MRMS) gauge-corrected precipitation product from 2018 to 2020 to evaluate three widely used satellite-based precipitation products over the U.S. coastal land versus the ocean (and the water over the Great Lakes). These products included the Integrated Multi-satellite Retrievals for GPM (IMERG), Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks (PERSIANN), and Climate Prediction Center Morphing technique (CMORPH). The MRMS data showed a precipitation climatology difference between the coastal land and the ocean that was higher in the winter and lower in the summer and autumn. IMERG and CMORPH performed best over land and water, respectively, while PERSIANN was the most consistent in its performance over land versus water. Heavy precipitation was overestimated by the three products, with larger overestimates over water than over land. These results were not affected by the MRMS uncertainties due to the gauge correction or by the use of different versions.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/rs14184557,"",,
rayyan-220225823,Application of UAV remote sensing and machine learning to model and map land use in urban gardens,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract Urban gardens are an integral part of urban agricultural systems, contributing to ecosystem services, biodiversity and human wellbeing. These systems occur at fine scales, can be highly complex and therefore offer the opportunity to test mechanisms of ecological patterns and processes. The capacity to confidently characterize urban gardens and their land uses is still lacking, while it could provide the basis for assessing ecosystem service provision. Land classifications from remote sensing platforms are common at the landscape scale, but imagery often lacks the resolution required to map differences in land use of fine-scale systems such as urban gardens. Here, we present a workflow to model and map land use in urban gardens using imagery from an unoccupied aerial vehicle (UAV) and machine learning. Due to high resolutions (&amp;lt;5 cm) from image acquisition at low altitudes, UAV remote sensing is better suited to characterize urban land use. We mapped six common land uses in 10 urban community gardens, exhibiting distinct spatial arrangements. Our models had good predictive performance, reaching 80% overall prediction accuracy in independent validation and up to 95% when assessing model performance per cover class. Extracting spatial metrics from these land use classifications, we found that at the garden and plot scale, plant species richness can be estimated by the total area and patchiness of crops. Land use classifications like these can offer an accessible tool to assess complex urban habitats and justify the importance of urban agriculture as a service-providing system, contributing to the sustainability and livability of cities.","",https://doi.org/10.1093/jue/juac008,"",,
rayyan-220225834,Remote Sensing for Biocultural Heritage Preservation in an African Semi-Arid Region: A Case Study of Indigenous Wells in Northern Kenya and Southern Ethiopia,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"The region of Southern Ethiopia (Borana) and Northern Kenya (Marsabit) is characterised by erratic rainfall, limited surface water, aridity, and frequent droughts. An important adaptive response to these conditions, of uncertain antiquity, has been the hand-excavation of a sequence of deep wells at key locations often along seasonal riverbeds and valley bottoms where subterranean aquifers can be tapped. Sophisticated indigenous water management systems have developed to ensure equitable access to these critical water resources, and these are part of well-defined customary institutional leadership structures that govern the community giving rise to a distinctive form of biocultural heritage. These systems, and the wells themselves, are increasingly under threat, however, from climate change, demographic growth, and socio-economic development. To contribute to an assessment of the scale, distribution and intensity of these threats, this study aimed to evaluate the land-use land-cover (LULC) and precipitation changes in this semi-arid to arid landscape and their association with, and impact on, the preservation of traditional wells. Multitemporal Landsat 5, 7 and 8 satellite imagery covering the period 1990 to 2020, analysed at a temporal resolution of 10 years, was classified using supervised classification via the Random Forest machine learning method to extract the following classes: bare land, grassland, shrub land, open forest, closed forest, croplands, settlement and waterbodies. Change detection was then applied to identify and quantify changes through time and landscape degradation indices were generated using the Shannon Diversity Index fragmentation index within a 15 km buffer of each well cluster. The results indicated that land cover change was mostly driven by increasing anthropogenic changes with resultant reduction in natural land cover classes. Furthermore, increased fragmentation has occurred within most of the selected buffer distances of the well clusters. The main drivers of change that have directly or indirectly impacted land degradation and the preservation of indigenous water management systems were identified through an analysis of land cover changes in the last 30 years, supporting insights from previous focused group discussions with communities in Kenya and Ethiopia. Our approach showed that remote sensing methods can be used for the spatially explicit mapping of landscape structure around the wells, and ultimately towards assessment of the preservation status of the indigenous wells.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/rs14020314,"",,

Despite its importance and finite availability, local‐scale monitoring of groundwater withdrawals required for sustainable water management practices is not carried out in most countries, including the United States. In this study, we combine publicly available datasets into a machine learning framework for estimating groundwater withdrawals over the state of Arizona. Here we include evapotranspiration, precipitation, crop coefficients, land use, annual discharge, well density, and watershed stress metrics for our predictions. We employ random forests to predict groundwater withdrawals from 2002 to 2020 at a 2 km spatial resolution using in situ groundwater withdrawal data available for Arizona Active Management Areas (AMA) and Irrigation Non‐Expansion Areas (INA) from 2002 to 2009 for training and 2010–2020 for validating the model respectively. The results show high training () and good testing () scores with normalized mean absolute error (NMAE) ≈ 0.62 and normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) ≈ 2.34 for the AMA/INA region. Using this method, we spatially extrapolate the existing groundwater withdrawal estimates to the entire state and observe the co‐occurrence of both groundwater withdrawals and land subsidence in South‐Central and Southern Arizona. Our model predicts groundwater withdrawals in regions where production wells are present on agricultural lands and subsidence is observed from Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR), but withdrawals are not monitored. By performing a comparative analysis over these regions using the predicted groundwater withdrawals and InSAR‐based land subsidence estimates, we observe a varying degree of subsidence for similar volumes of withdrawals in different basins. The performance of our model on validation datasets and its favourable comparison with independent water use proxies such as InSAR demonstrate the effectiveness and extensibility of our combined remote sensing and machine learning‐based approach.","",https://doi.org/10.1002/hyp.14757,"",,

The increased utilization of land resources due to population growth have led to loss of biodiversity and urban planning issues such as flooding and pollution. This study analysed the LULC changes within the Kpeshie lagoon Basin of the Greater Accra Region of Ghana and made prediction to the year 2030. Random Forest (RF) classifier was employed to classify the LULC within the study area using Landsat image for four different time-steps (1991, 2002, 2013 and 2020). LULC change analysis was performed for consecutive years (1991 – 2002, 2002 – 2013 and 2013 – 2020) and for the entire period (1991 – 2020). Subsequently, a prediction LULC was made to the year 2030 using a combination of artificial neural network (ANN) and cellular automata (CA) simulations.

Over the last decade, multiple approaches have been developed to derive spatiotemporal dynamics of GPP combining <italic xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"">in situ</i> observations and remote sensing data using machine learning techniques or semiempirical models.

Sentinel-2 satellites are expected to open new opportunities to analyze ecosystem processes with spectral bands chosen to study vegetation between 10- and 20-m spatial resolutions with five-day revisit frequency. Of particular relevance is the availability of red-edge bands that are suitable for deriving estimates of canopy chlorophyll content that are expected to be much better than any previous global mission.

Here, we map tropical tree cover and deforestation between 2015 and 2022 using 5 m spatial resolution Planet NICFI satellite images over the state of Mato Grosso (MT) in Brazil and a U-net deep learning model. The tree cover for the state was 556510.8 km$^2$ in 2015 (58.1 % of the MT State) and was reduced to 141598.5 km$^2$ (14.8 % of total area) at the end of 2021. After reaching a minimum deforested area in December 2016 with 6632.05 km$^2$, the bi-annual deforestation area only showed a slight increase between December 2016 and December 2019. A year after, the areas of deforestation almost doubled from 9944.5 km$^2$ in December 2019 to 19817.8 km$^2$ in December 2021. The high-resolution data product showed relatively consistent agreement with the official deforestation map from Brazil (67.2%) but deviated significantly from year of forest cover loss estimates from the Global Forest change (GFC) product, mainly due to large area of fire degradation observed in the GFC data.

However, mapping soils using conventional in situ survey protocols is time-consuming and costly. We addressed the outdated spatial information on soil physico-chemical properties for a tropical region with a ~700-km longitudinal gradient of contrasting topography, climate, and vegetation (~98,000 km2; NE Brazil), by developing a novel hybrid machine learning framework and applying it to this region. This framework reduces prediction redundancies due to high multicollinearity by implementing a recursive feature selector algorithm for input selection; its core is composed of the Soil-Landscape Estimation and Evaluation Program (SLEEP) and a calibrated Gradient Boosting Model (GBM) capable of modeling the spatial distribution of soil properties at multiple and dynamic soil depths. The use of SLEEP and GBM allowed us to explain the spatial distribution of various soil properties and their environmental modulators. The model training and testing approach used six topographical, ten meteorological and two vegetation properties, and data from 223 soil profiles across the study area. Our models demonstrated a consistent performance with spatial extrapolations exhibiting r2 values of 0.79–0.98, and -1.39–1.14% percent bias. The properties related to topography and climate were dominating when estimating the number of soil layers, soil texture, and the sum of bases. Our framework features high flexibility and it is transferable to other tropical regions, while reducing capital investments and increasing accuracy when compared to traditional mapping protocols.","",https://doi.org/10.31223/x57p9w,"",,
rayyan-220225898,Mapping Forest Stability within Major Biomes Using Canopy Indices Derived from MODIS Time Series,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Deforestation and forest degradation from human land use, including primary forest loss, are of growing concern. The conservation of old-growth and other forests with important environmental values is central to many international initiatives aimed at protecting biodiversity, mitigating climate change impacts, and supporting sustainable livelihoods. Current remote-sensing products largely focus on deforestation rather than forest degradation and are dependent on machine learning, calibrated with extensive field measurements. To help address this, we developed a novel approach for mapping forest ecosystem stability, defined in terms of constancy, which is a key characteristic of long-undisturbed (including primary) forests. Our approach categorizes forests into stability classes based on satellite-data time series related to plant water–carbon relationships. Specifically, we used long-term dynamics of the fraction of photosynthetically active radiation intercepted by the canopy (fPAR) and shortwave infrared water stress index (SIWSI) derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) for the period 2003–2018. We calculated a set of variables from annual time series of fPAR and SIWSI for representative forest regions at opposite ends of Earth’s climatic and latitudinal gradients: boreal forests of Siberia (southern taiga, Russia) and tropical rainforests of the Amazon basin (Kayapó territory, Brazil). Independent validation drew upon high-resolution Landsat imagery and forest cover change data. The results indicate that the proposed approach is accurate and applicable across forest biomes and, thereby, provides a timely and transferrable method to aid in the identification and conservation of stable forests. Information on the location of less stable forests is equally relevant for ecological restoration, reforestation, and proforestation activities.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/rs14153813,"",,

Climate change and deforestation have impacts on the carbon budget in Amazonia, transforming CO2 sink areas into sources. Given the complexity of the factors that govern the carbon exchange in the Amazon and its influence on biological processes, the use of Data science strategies can promote a better understanding about the main environmental factors for different scenarios, and also, assist in public policies to mitigate the global warming effects. This study aims to identify the environmental factors that determine the temporal variability of carbon exchanges between the biosphere and the atmosphere in the Tapajós National Forest, in the Amazon, applying Data Science strategies in an integrated set of environmental data from energy and carbon fluxes and remote sensing data. The specific objective is to assess the influence of a selected set of environmental variables on the variability of carbon exchanges, with the use of an artificial neural networks classification model to identify the variables with great impact on source, sink and neutrality scenarios in Tapajós National Forest. Data Science strategies were applied to an integrated dataset of ground-based carbon flux measurements and remote sensing data, considering the period between 2002 and 2006. An artificial neural network (ANN) classification model was developed to identify the environmental variables with great impact on carbon source, sink and neutrality conditions. The average global score of ANN model was 65%. It was possible to identify the predictor variables with greatest impact to the carbon sink condition: radiation at the top of the atmosphere, sensible and latent energy fluxes and leaf area index. Thus, the ANN model with an ensemble of Data Science strategies can improve a better understanding of variability CO2 fluxes and be a powerful tool to promote new knowledge.","",https://doi.org/10.1002/essoar.10512492.1,"",,

Southern Africa encompasses significant areas of dryland forests that are important to local communities but are facing rapid deforestation and are highly vulnerable to biome degradation from land uses and extreme climate events. Appropriate integration of remote sensing technologies helps to assess and monitor forest ecosystems and provide spatially explicit, operational, and long-term data to assist the sustainable use of tropical environment landscapes. The period from 2010 onwards has seen the rapid development of remote sensing research on tropical forests, which has led to a significant increase in the number of scientific publications. This review aims to analyse and synthesise the evidence published in peer review studies with a focus on optical and radar remote sensing of dryland forests in Southern Africa from 1997–2020. For this study, 137 citation indexed research publications have been analysed with respect to publication timing, study location, spatial and temporal scale of applied remote sensing data, satellite sensors or platforms employed, research topics considered, and overall outcomes of the studies. This enabled us to provide a comprehensive overview of past achievements, current efforts, major research topics studies, EO product gaps/challenges, and to propose ways in which challenges may be overcome. It is hoped that this review will motivate discussion and encourage uptake of new remote sensing tools (e.g., Google Earth Engine (GEE)), data (e.g., the Sentinel satellites), improved vegetation parameters (e.g., red-edge related indices, vegetation optical depth (VOD)) and methodologies (e.g., data fusion or deep learning, etc.), where these have potential applications in monitoring dryland forests.","",https://doi.org/10.1088/2515-7620/ac5b84,"",,
rayyan-220225922,Sentinel-1 Spatiotemporal Simulation Using Convolutional LSTM for Flood Mapping,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"The synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery has been widely applied for flooding mapping based on change detection approaches. However, errors in the mapping result are expected since not all land-cover changes are flood-induced, and those changes are sensitive to SAR data, such as crop growth or harvest over agricultural lands, clearance of forested areas, and/or modifications on the urban landscape. This study, therefore, incorporated historical SAR images to boost the detection of flood-induced changes during extreme weather events, using the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) method. Additionally, to incorporate the spatial signatures for the change detection, we applied a deep learning-based spatiotemporal simulation framework, Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM), for simulating a synthetic image using Sentinel One intensity time series. This synthetic image will be prepared in advance of flood events, and then it can be used to detect flood areas using change detection when the post-image is available. Practically, significant divergence between the synthetic image and post-image is expected over inundated zones, which can be mapped by applying thresholds to the Delta image (synthetic image minus post-image). We trained and tested our model on three events from Australia, Brazil, and Mozambique. The generated Flood Proxy Maps were compared against reference data derived from Sentinel Two and Planet Labs optical data. To corroborate the effectiveness of the proposed methods, we also generated Delta products for two baseline models (closest post-image minus pre-image and historical mean minus post-image) and two LSTM architectures: normal LSTM and ConvLSTM. Results show that thresholding of ConvLSTM Delta yielded the highest Cohen’s Kappa coefficients in all study cases: 0.92 for Australia, 0.78 for Mozambique, and 0.68 for Brazil. Lower Kappa values obtained in the Mozambique case can be subject to the topographic effect on SAR imagery. These results still confirm the benefits in terms of classification accuracy that convolutional operations provide in time series analysis of satellite data employing spatially correlated information in a deep learning framework.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/rs14020246,"",,

Their sustainable management and conservation is crucial in the current context of global warming and biodiversity conservation. To tackle such challenges, Earth observation data has been identified as a valuable source of information capable to provide stakeholders with informative indicators to support the decision making process related to forest ecosystems management. While Earth observation data constitutes an unprecedented opportunity to monitor forest ecosystems, its effective exploitation still poses serious challenges since multi-modal (i.e. multi-scale and multi-source) information need to be combined in order to describe complex natural phenomena. To deal with this particular issue in the context of structure and biophysical variables estimation for forest characterization, we propose a new deep learning based fusion strategy to combine together high density 3D-point clouds acquired by airborne laser scanning (ALS) with high resolution optical imagery freely accessible via the Sentinel-2 mission. In order to manage and fully exploit the available multi-modal information, we implement a two-branch late fusion deep learning architecture taking advantage of the specificity of each modality: on the one hand, a 2D-CNN branch is devoted to the analysis of Sentinel-2 time series data and, on the other hand, a Multi-Layer Perceptron branch is dedicated to the processing of LiDAR-derived information. The whole framework is learnt end-to-end in order to effectively exploit the complementarity between the two sources of information.The performance of our framework is evaluated on two forest variables of interest: total volume and basal area at stand level. The obtained results underline that the availability of multi-modal remote sensing data is not a direct synonym of performance improvements but, the way in which they are combined together is of paramount importance to leverage the complex interplay among the different input sources.","",https://doi.org/10.1109/jstars.2022.3175609,"",,

Excessive dependence on rainfed agricultural production makes Africa more vulnerable to climate change effects. Weather information and services are essential for farmers to more effectively survive the increasing occurrence of extreme weather events due to climate change. Weather information is important for resource management in agricultural production and helps farmers plan their farming activities in advance. Machine Learning is one of the technologies used in agriculture for weather forecasting and crop disease detection among others. The objective of this study is to develop Machine Learning-based models adapted to the context of daily weather forecasting for Rainfall, Relative Humidity, and Maximum and Minimum Temperature in Senegal. In this study, we made a comparison of ten Machine Learning Regressors with our Ensemble Model. These models were evaluated based on Mean Absolute Error, Mean Squared Error, Root Mean Squared Error and Coefficient of Determination. The results show that the Ensemble Model performs better than the ten base models. The Ensemble Model results for each parameter are as follows; Relative Humidity: Mean Absolute Error was 4.0126, Mean Squared Error was 29.9885, Root Mean Squared Error was 5.4428 and Coefficient of Determination was 0.9335. For Minimum Temperature: Mean Absolute Error was 0.7908, Mean Squared Error was 1.1329, Root Mean Squared Error was 1.0515 and Coefficient of Determination was 0.9018.

At present, there are few studies on the spatial–temporal evolution characteristics of land-use change in earthquake-stricken regions, especially the lack of quantitative evaluation of the impact of earthquakes on land use at the micro-scale. The “5·12” Wenchuan ms8.0 earthquake caused serious damage to the surface resources in the disaster area. The study on the spatial–temporal evolution characteristics of land-use change in the disaster area can provide a reference for the remote sensing dynamic monitoring of the ecological environment. Therefore, based on geographical big data, this paper used a land-use comprehensive degree index, land-use transfer matrix, and landscape ecological index to explore and analyze the spatial–temporal evolution characteristics of land use in Wenchuan County before and after the earthquake. The results showed that the types of cropland, forest, built-up, and bare land changed greatly before and after the earthquake. During the earthquake recovery period, the comprehensive index of land use in the study area basically showed an increasing trend. Under the effect of artificial measures and natural restoration, land use was continuously improved, and vegetation was restored well. After 2008, the Patch Density (PD) and Landscape Shape Index (LSI) values of most landscape types decreased, and the Aggregation Index (AI) values increased, indicating that the ecological environment of the whole region showed a benign development in the post-earthquake period. The results not only contribute to the establishment of scientific ecological environment management in earthquake-stricken regions but also contribute to the formulation of long-term ecological environment monitoring and ecological restoration planning according to the law of land-use change.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/su14159721,"",,

The information available for the area only refers to the location and the extent of the burned areas based on medium and low-spatial resolution imagery, ranging from 30 m up to 1 km. However, to improve measurements and assist in environmental actions, robust methods are required to provide a detailed mapping on a higher-spatial scale of the burned areas, such as PlanetScope imagery with 3–5 m spatial resolution. As state-of-the-art, Deep Learning (DL) segmentation methods, in specific Transformed-based networks, are one of the best emerging approaches to extract information from remote sensing imagery. Here we combine Transformers DL methods and high-resolution planet imagery to map burned areas in the Brazilian Pantanal wetland. We first compared the performances of multiple DL-based networks, namely Segformer and DTP Transformers methods with CNN-based networks like PSPNet, FCN, DeepLabV3+, OCRNet, and ISANet, applied in Planet imagery, considering RGB and near-infrared within a large dataset of 1282 image patches (512 × 512 pixels). We later verified the generalization capability of the model for segmenting burned areas in different areas, located in the Brazilian Amazon, which is also worldwide known due to its environmental relevance. As a result, the two transformers based-methods, SegFormer (F1-score equals 95.91%) and DTP (F1-score equals 95.15%), provided the most accurate results in mapping burned forest areas in Pantanal. Results show that the combination of SegFormer and RGB+NIR image with pre-trained weights is the best option (F1-score of 96.52%) to distinguish burned from not-burned areas. When applying the generated model in two Brazilian Amazon forest regions, we achieved F1-score averages of 95.88% for burned areas. We conclude that Transformer-based networks are fit to deal with burned areas in two of the most relevant environmental areas of the world using high-spatial-resolution imagery.","",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jag.2022.103151,"",,

The modelling results demonstrate that the typical steppe has larger suitable area and more proportion for grasshopper living than meadow steppe. The soil type, above biomass, altitude and temperature mainly determine the grasshopper occurrence in typical steppe and meadow steppe. However, the contribution of these factors in the two grass types is significantly different. In addition, related vegetation and meteorological factors affect the different growing stages of grasshoppers between the two grass types. This study clearly defines the different effects of key environmental factors (meteorology, vegetation, soil and topography) for grasshopper occurrence in typical steppe and meadow steppe.

Land-use changes from 2000 to 2035 were simulated and projected under the current trend scenario (CTS), economic development scenario (EDS) and ecological protection scenario (EPS) in the Heihe River Basin, while the RSEI was predicted using the elastic net regression (machine learning method); finally, the predicted results were synthesized and analyzed. The results showed that forest, grassland and water were positively correlated with ecological quality, with the green space coverage under the CTS, EPS and EDS accounting for 34.15%, 70.65% and 34.72% of the total transferred land area, respectively. The increase in the area of build-up land and unutilized land was detrimental to ecological quality, with the area of building land in the EDS being 1.75 times larger than in the year 2000. The EDS contributes to the sustainable development of the upstream area and the EPS is more conducive to the midstream and downstream areas by limiting the expansion of build-up land and by developing unutilized land in a limited way to increase the area of green space after reconciling economic conditions. Projection results promote the rational allocation of various land-use types in the future (semi) arid region, such as artificial forestation, unutilized land development and restriction of urban expansion, and also lay the foundation for the formulation of policies such as water allocation and ecological protection to facilitate the sustainable development of regional society, economy and ecology.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/su14052716,"",,

This task is mostly regarded as an image retrieval problem. The key underpinning this task is to design a series of deep neural networks to learn discriminative image descriptors. However, existing methods meet large performance drops under realistic weather, such as rain and fog, since they do not take the domain shift between the training data and multiple test environments into consideration. To minor this domain gap, we propose a Multiple-environment Self-adaptive Network (MuSe-Net) to dynamically adjust the domain shift caused by environmental changing. In particular, MuSe-Net employs a two-branch neural network containing one multiple-environment style extraction network and one self-adaptive feature extraction network. As the name implies, the multiple-environment style extraction network is to extract the environment-related style information, while the self-adaptive feature extraction network utilizes an adaptive modulation module to dynamically minimize the environment-related style gap. Extensive experiments on two widely-used benchmarks, i.e., University-1652 and CVUSA, demonstrate that the proposed MuSe-Net achieves a competitive result for geo-localization in multiple environments. Furthermore, we observe that the proposed method also shows great potential to the unseen extreme weather, such as mixing the fog, rain and snow.","",https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2204.08381,"",,

The future LULC changes for the year 2051 were simulated for four scenarios, namely Business-as-Usual (BAU), Rapid Agricultural Expansion (RAE), Ecosystems Protection and Agricultural Development (EPAD) and Landscape Ecosystems Restoration and Conservation (LERC). The four LULC change scenarios were simulated based on anticipated assumptions that were derived from existing spatial policies, a consultation workshop report on scenarios of agricultural development in Ethiopia, suitability analysis, population growth analysis and expert knowledge of the study area characteristics. We used a Multi-Layer Perceptron–Artificial Neuron Network (MLP–ANN) model-based projected LULC for the BAU scenario and the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST) model to generate RAE, EPAD and LERC scenarios in the study landscape. The benefit transfer method was used to estimate the total ES values and for trade-off analysis. The result showed that LULC changes in the study area varied across simulated scenarios compared to the base year 2021. Under the BAU and RAE scenarios, cultivated land increased by 146,548 ha (22%) and 193,965 ha (29%), whereas forest, water body, wetland and shrub-bush land were reduced. However, forest cover increased by 31,725 ha and 100,080 ha but bare land was reduced by 8466 ha (21%) and 10,379 ha (25%) under the EPAD and LERC scenarios. The forest cover annual rate of change was 3.2% and 6% under the EPAD and LERC scenarios. As a result, the total ES value increased by USD 24.5 and 78.5 million under the EPAD and LERC scenarios for the year 2051, whereas the total ES value was reduced under the BAU and RAE scenarios by USD 27.1 and 73.2 million. The trade-offs among ecosystem services were significantly synergized under the LERC scenario compared to RAE. Therefore, EPAD and LERC could be used as a reference for sustainable landscape planning and management.

This paper presents TimeSpec4LULC (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5913554; Khaldi et al., 2022), a smart open-source global dataset of multispectral time series for 29 LULC classes ready to train machine learning models. TimeSpec4LULC was built based on the seven spectral bands of the MODIS sensors at 500 m resolution, from 2000 to 2021, and was annotated using spatial–temporal agreement across the 15 global LULC products available in Google Earth Engine (GEE). The 22-year monthly time series of the seven bands were created globally by (1) applying different spatial–temporal quality assessment filters on MODIS Terra and Aqua satellites; (2) aggregating their original 8 d temporal granularity into monthly composites; (3) merging Terra + Aqua data into a combined time series; and (4) extracting, at the pixel level, 6 076 531 time series of size 262 for the seven bands along with a set of metadata: geographic coordinates, country and departmental divisions, spatial–temporal consistency across LULC products, temporal data availability, and the global human modification index. A balanced subset of the original dataset was also provided by selecting 1000 evenly distributed samples from each class such that they are representative of the entire globe. To assess the annotation quality of the dataset, a sample of pixels, evenly distributed around the world from each LULC class, was selected and validated by experts using very high resolution images from both Google Earth and Bing Maps imagery. This smartly, pre-processed, and annotated dataset is targeted towards scientific users interested in developing various machine learning models, including deep learning networks, to perform global LULC mapping.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-14-1377-2022,"",,

The human pressure over coastal areas is becoming increasingly relevant, due to the combinations of resource depletion, climate change effects and ocean eutrophication. Coastal ecosystems are so exposed to a huge number of stress factors that endanger their ecosystem services, like carbon uptake and biodiversity maintenance, that can be crucial in facing the effects of climate changes. With a particular focus on seaweeds, these ecosystems are becoming rapidly relevant both for carbon sinks and as a source of high value products, for example thanks to cosmetic and food industries that produce high added values products.In this contest the capability of conducting efficient monitoring is crucial to monitor environmental dynamics and resources trends. Traditionally seaweed monitoring was carried out with on field surveys that could be based on botanic analysis combined with genetic study, depending on the aims. Recently Remote Sensing techniques, combined with Artificial Intelligence ones, gave a new perspective to seaweed monitoring, introducing tools that are always more efficient.In this contest the present work aims to test the potentiality of remote sensing and artificial intelligence techniques for seaweed monitoring along the Irish west coast, building the basis for a fully automated tool for monitoring. The results showed that, with a supervised classification approach, it is possible to train Random Forest (RF) to perform very precise classification over the entire West Coast of Ireland. In particular, with all the RF configurations tested the Overall Accuracy (OA) was greater than 98.61, with the best performance obtained with the configuration Ntree = 600 and mtry = 2 that produced an OA = 98.87.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/isprs-archives-xliii-b3-2022-1011-2022,"",,
rayyan-220226101,Integration of Satellite-Based Optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar Imagery to Estimate Winter Cover Crop Performance in Cereal Grasses,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"The magnitude of ecosystem services provided by winter cover crops is linked to their performance (i.e., biomass and associated nitrogen content, forage quality, and fractional ground cover), although few studies quantify these characteristics across the landscape. Remote sensing can produce landscape-level assessments of cover crop performance. However, commonly employed optical vegetation indices (VI) saturate, limiting their ability to measure high-biomass cover crops. Contemporary VIs that employ red-edge bands have been shown to be more robust to saturation issues. Additionally, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data have been effective at estimating crop biophysical characteristics, although this has not been demonstrated on winter cover crops. We assessed the integration of optical (Sentinel-2) and SAR (Sentinel-1) imagery to estimate winter cover crops biomass across 27 fields over three winter–spring seasons (2018–2021) in Maryland. We used log-linear models to predict cover crop biomass as a function of 27 VIs and eight SAR metrics. Our results suggest that the integration of the normalized difference red-edge vegetation index (NDVI_RE1; employing Sentinel-2 bands 5 and 8A), combined with SAR interferometric (InSAR) coherence, best estimated the biomass of cereal grass cover crops. However, these results were season- and species-specific (R2 = 0.74, 0.81, and 0.34; RMSE = 1227, 793, and 776 kg ha−1, for wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), triticale (Triticale hexaploide L.), and cereal rye (Secale cereale), respectively, in spring (March–May)). Compared to the optical-only model, InSAR coherence improved biomass estimations by 4% in wheat, 5% in triticale, and by 11% in cereal rye. Both optical-only and optical-SAR biomass prediction models exhibited saturation occurring at ~1900 kg ha−1; thus, more work is needed to enable accurate biomass estimations past the point of saturation. To address this continued concern, future work could consider the use of weather and climate variables, machine learning models, the integration of proximal sensing and satellite observations, and/or the integration of process-based crop-soil simulation models and remote sensing observations.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/rs14092077,"",,

This study aims to estimate baseline and decadal changes in continental US surface SOC stocks under future emission scenarios. Location Continental United States. Time period 2014–2100. Methods We used recent SOC field observations ( n = 6,213 sites), environmental factors ( n = 32), and an ensemble machine learning (ML) approach to estimate baseline SOC stocks in surface soils across the continental United States at 100‐m spatial resolution, and decadal changes under the projected climate scenarios of Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase Six (CMIP6) earth system models (ESMs). Results Baseline SOC projections from ML approaches captured more than 50% of variability in SOC observations, whereas ESMs represented only 6–16% of observed SOC variability. ML estimates showed a mean total loss of 1.8 Pg C from US surface soils under the high‐emission scenario by 2100, whereas ESMs showed no significant change in SOC stocks with wide variation among ESMs. Both ML and ESM predictions agree on the direction of SOC change (net emissions or sequestration) across 46–51% of continental US land area. These differences are attributable to the high‐resolution site‐specific data used in the ML models compared to the relatively coarse grid represented in CMIP6 ESMs. Main conclusions Our high‐resolution estimates of baseline SOC stocks, identification of key environmental controllers, and projection of SOC changes from US land cover types under future climate scenarios suggest the need for high‐resolution simulations of SOC in ESMs to represent the heterogeneity of SOC. We found that the SOC change is sensitive to key soil related factors (e.g. soil drainage and soil order) that have not been historically considered as input parameters in ESMs, because currently more than 95% variability in the SOC of CMIP6 ESMs is controlled by net primary productivity, temperature, and precipitation. Using additional environmental factors to estimate the baseline SOC stocks and predict the future trajectory of SOC change can provide more accurate results.","",https://doi.org/10.1111/geb.13489,"",,
rayyan-220226114,Modeling reservoir surface temperatures for regional and global climate models: a multi-model study on the inflow and level variation effects,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract. The complexity of the state-of-the-art climate models requires high computational resources and imposes rather simplified parameterization of inland waters. The effect of lakes and reservoirs on the local and regional climate is commonly parameterized in regional or global climate modeling as a function of surface water temperature estimated by atmosphere-coupled one-dimensional lake models. The latter typically neglect one of the major transport mechanisms specific to artificial reservoirs: heat and mass advection due to inflows and outflows. Incorporation of these essentially two-dimensional processes into lake parameterizations requires a trade-off between computational efficiency and physical soundness, which is addressed in this study. We evaluated the performance of the two most used lake parameterization schemes and a machine-learning approach on high-resolution historical water temperature records from 24 reservoirs. Simulations were also performed at both variable and constant water level to explore the thermal structure differences between lakes and reservoirs. Our results highlight the need to include anthropogenic inflow and outflow controls in regional and global climate models. Our findings also highlight the efficiency of the machine-learning approach, which may overperform process-based physical models in both accuracy and computational requirements if applied to reservoirs with long-term observations available. Overall, results suggest that the combined use of process-based physical models and machine-learning models will considerably improve the modeling of air–lake heat and moisture fluxes. A relationship between mean water retention times and the importance of inflows and outflows is established: reservoirs with a retention time shorter than ∼ 100 d, if simulated without inflow and outflow effects, tend to exhibit a statistically significant deviation in the computed surface temperatures regardless of their morphological characteristics.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-15-173-2022,"",,
rayyan-220226118,Ensemble Machine Learning Outperforms Empirical Equations for the Ground Heat Flux Estimation with Remote Sensing Data,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Estimating evapotranspiration at the field scale is a major component of sustainable water management. Due to the difficulty to assess some major unknowns of the water cycle at that scale, including irrigation amounts, evapotranspiration is often computed as the residual of the instantaneous surface energy budget. One of the Surface Energy Balance components with the largest uncertainties in their quantification over bare soils and sparse vegetation areas is the ground heat flux (G). Over the last decades, the estimation of G with remote sensing (RS) data has been mainly achieved with empirical equations, on the basis of the G and net radiation (Rn) ratio, G/Rn. The G/Rn empirical equations generally require vegetation data (Type I empirical equations), in combination with surface temperature (Ts) and albedo (Type II empirical equations). In this article, we aim to evaluate the estimation of G with RS data. Here, we compared eight G/Rn empirical equations against two types of machine learning (ML) methods: an ensemble ML type, the Random Forest (RF), and the Neural Networks (NN). The comparison of each method was evaluated using a wide range of climate and land cover datasets, including data from Eddy-Covariance towers that extend along the mid-latitude areas that encompass the European and African continents. Our results have shown evidence that the driver of G in bare soils and sparse vegetation areas (Fraction of Vegetation, Fv ≤ 0.25) is Ts, instead of vegetation greenness indexes. On the other hand, the accuracy in the estimation of G with Rn, Ts or Fv decreases in densely vegetated areas (Fv ≥ 0.50). There are no significant differences between the most accurate Type I and II empirical equations. For bare soils and sparse vegetation areas the empirical equation which combines the Leaf Area Index (LAI) and Ts (E7) estimates G best. In densely vegetated areas, an exponential empirical equation based on Fv (E4), shows the best performance. However, ML better estimates G than the empirical equations, independently of the Fv ranges. An RF model with Rn, LAI and Ts as predictor variables shows the best accuracy and performance metrics, outperforming the NN model.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/rs14081788,"",,
rayyan-220226122,Blue carbon ecosystem monitoring using remote sensing reveals wetland restoration pathways,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"In an era of climate and biodiversity crises, ecosystem rehabilitation is critical to the ongoing wellbeing of humans and the environment. Coastal ecosystem rehabilitation is particularly important, as these ecosystems sequester large quantities of carbon (known in marine ecosystems as “blue carbon”) thereby mitigating climate change effects while also providing ecosystem services and biodiversity benefits. The recent formal accreditation of blue carbon services is producing a proliferation of rehabilitation projects, which must be monitored and quantified over time and space to assess on-ground outcomes. Consequently, remote sensing techniques such as drone surveys, and machine learning techniques such as image classification, are increasingly being employed to monitor wetlands. However, few projects, if any, have tracked blue carbon restoration across temporal and spatial scales at an accuracy that could be used to adequately map species establishment with low-cost methods. This study presents an open-source, user-friendly workflow, using object-based image classification and a random forest classifier in Google Earth Engine, to accurately classify 4 years of multispectral and photogrammetrically derived digital elevation model drone data at a saltmarsh rehabilitation site on the east coast of Australia (Hunter River estuary, NSW). High classification accuracies were achieved, with &amp;gt;90% accuracy at 0.1 m resolution. At the study site, saltmarsh colonised most suitable areas, increasing by 142% and resulting in 56 tonnes of carbon sequestered, within a 4-year period, providing insight into blue carbon regeneration trajectories. Saltmarsh growth patterns were species-specific, influenced by species’ reproductive and dispersal strategies. Our findings suggested that biotic factors and interactions were important in influencing species’ distributions and succession trajectories. This work can help improve the efficiency and effectiveness of restoration planning and monitoring at coastal wetlands and similar ecosystems worldwide, with the potential to apply this approach to other types of remote sensing imagery and to calculate other rehabilitation co-benefits. Importantly, the method can be used to calculate blue carbon habitat creation following tidal restoration of coastal wetlands.","",https://doi.org/10.3389/fenvs.2022.924221,"",,

Non-risk-oriented LULCCs can act as disaster risk drivers by increasing levels of exposure and vulnerability or by reducing capacity. Making thematically detailed long-term LULCC data available is crucial to improving understanding of those dynamics interlinked at different spatiotemporal scales. For the Ayeyarwady Delta, one of the least studied mega-deltas, such comprehensive information is still lacking. This study used 50 Landsat and Sentinel-1A images spanning five decades from 1974 to 2021 in five-year intervals. A hybrid ensemble model consisting of six machine-learning classifiers was employed to generate land-cover maps from the images, achieving accuracies of about 90%. The major identified potential risk-relevant LULCC dynamics include urban growth towards low-lying areas, mangrove deforestation, and the expansion of irrigated agricultural areas and cultivated aquatic surfaces. The novel area-wide LULCC products achieved through the analyses provide a basis to support future risk-sensitive development decisions and can be used for regionally adapted disaster risk management plans and models.

Peatlands store large amounts of soil carbon and freshwater, constituting an important component of the global carbon and hydrologic cycles. Accurate information on the global extent and distribution of peatlands is presently lacking but is needed by Earth System Models (ESMs) to simulate the effects of climate change on the global carbon and hydrologic balance. Here, we present Peat-ML, a spatially continuous global map of peatland fractional coverage generated using machine learning techniques suitable for use as a prescribed geophysical field in an ESM. Inputs to our statistical model follow drivers of peatland formation and include spatially distributed climate, geomorphological and soil data, along with remotely-sensed vegetation indices. Available maps of peatland fractional coverage for 14 relatively extensive regions were used along with mapped ecoregions of non-peatland areas to train the statistical model. In addition to qualitative comparisons to other maps in the literature, we estimated model error in two ways. The first estimate used the training data in a blocked leave-one-out cross-validation strategy designed to minimize the influence of spatial autocorrelation. That approach yielded an average r2 of 0.73 with a root mean squared error and mean bias error of 9.11 % and −0.36 %, respectively. Our second error estimate was generated by comparing Peat-ML against a high-quality, extensively ground-truthed map generated by Ducks Unlimited Canada for the Canadian Boreal Plains region. This comparison suggests our map to be of comparable quality to mapping products generated through more traditional approaches, at least for boreal peatlands.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-2021-426,"",,

A large proportion of these critical raw materials are expected to be sourced from as yet undiscovered mineral deposits, which has the potential to accelerate environmental pressures on natural ecosystems. Herein we overlay new prospectivity model results for a major source of Canada’s battery minerals (i.e., magmatic Ni ± Cu ± Co ± PGE mineral systems) with five ecosystem services (i.e., freshwater resources, carbon, nature-based recreation, species at risk, climate-change refugia) and gaps in the current protected-area network to identify areas of high geological potential with lower ecological risk. New prospectivity models were trained on high-resolution geological and geophysical survey compilations using spatial cross-validation methods. The area under the curve for the receive operating characteristics (ROC) plot and the preferred gradient boosting machines model is 0.972, reducing the search space for more than 90% of deposits in the test set by 89%. Using the inflection point on the ROC plot as a threshold, we demonstrate that 16% of the most prospective model cells partially overlap with the current network of protected and other conserved areas, further reducing the search space for new critical mineral deposits. The vast majority of the remaining high prospectivity cells correspond to ecoregions with less than half of the protected areas required to meet national conservation targets. Poorly protected ecoregions with one or more of the five ecosystem services are interpreted as hotspots with the highest potential for conflicting land-use priorities in the future, including parts of southern Ontario and Québec, western Labrador, and northern Manitoba and Saskatchewan. Managing hotspots with multiple land-use priorities would necessarily involve partnerships with both Indigenous peoples whose traditional lands are affected, and other impacted communities. We suggest that prospectivity models and other machine learning methods can be used as part of natural resources management strategies to balance critical mineral development with conservation and biodiversity values.","",https://doi.org/10.3389/esss.2022.10064,"",,
rayyan-220226167,A COMPARISON OF CLOUD REMOVAL METHODS FOR DEFORESTATION MONITORING IN AMAZON RAINFOREST,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract. Deforestation in tropical rainforests is a major source of carbon dioxide emissions, an important driver of climate change. For decades, the Brazilian government has maintained monitoring programs for deforestation detection in the Brazilian Legal Amazon area based on remotely sensed optical images in a protocol that involves considerable efforts of visual interpretation. However, the Amazon region is covered with clouds for most of the year, and deforestation assessment can rely only on images acquired in the dry season when cloud-free images are more likely to capture. One possibility to lessen that restriction and enable deforestation detection throughout the year is to synthesize cloud-free optical images from corresponding SAR images, which are only marginally influenced by atmospheric conditions. This work compares a set of such image synthesis methods, considering deforestation detection in the Amazon forest as the target application. Specifically, we evaluate three deep learning methods for cloud removal in Sentinel-2 images: a conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) based on the pix2pix architecture; an extension of that method, which uses atrous convolutions (Atrous cGAN) to enhance fine image details; and a non-generative method (DSen2-CR) based on residual networks. In the evaluation, we assess both the quality of the generated images and the accuracy obtained when performing deforestation detection from those images. We further compare those methods with an image aggregation tool available in Google Earth Engine (GEE Tool), which creates cloud-free mosaics from sequences of images acquired at nearby dates. In this study, we considered two sites in the Brazilian Amazon, characterized by distinct vegetation and deforestation patterns. In terms of the quality metrics and classification accuracy, the Atrous cGAN was the best performing deep learning method. The GEE Tool outperformed all those methods when dealing with images from the dry season but turned out to be the poorest performing method in the wet season.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/isprs-archives-xliii-b3-2022-665-2022,"",,

For the Amazon rainforest, automated mapping is of critical importance, as land cover is changing rapidly due to forest degradation and deforestation. Several research groups have addressed this challenge by conducting local surveys and producing maps using freely available remote sensing data. However, automating the process of large-scale land cover mapping remains one of the biggest challenges in the remote sensing community. One issue when using supervised learning is the scarcity of labeled training data. One way to address this problem is to make use of already available maps produced with (semi-) automated classifiers. This is also known as weakly supervised learning. The present study aims to develop novel methods for automated LULC classification in the cloud-prone Amazon basin (Brazil) based on the labels from the MapBiomas project, which include twelve classes. We investigate different fusion techniques for multi-spectral Sentinel-2 data and synthetic aperture radar Sentinel-1 time-series from 2018.

Moose (Alces alces) in Northeast China is on the southernmost edge of the geographical range of Eurasian moose, the distribution of this population is retreating, and population number has been declining for the last several decades. However, little is known about its habitat suitability over a large spatial scale, which hinders further effective conservation of the moose in China. It is critical to explore the moose-habitat relationships and habitat suitability to understand moose habitat requirements, potential land use impacts, and effective management. In this paper, we combined remote sensing-derived predictors and machine learning methods (down-sampling random forests) to explore the moose-habitat associations and map moose habitat suitability. Results showed that our model performed well to excellently in terms of three evaluation metrics (AUCROC, AUCPR, CBI), which indicates the advantages of the combination of remote sensing and machine learning methods in predicting moose habitat. We identified the main factors driving moose distribution in Northeast China are the human footprint index, the mean monthly maximum temperature of the late spring, the percentage of coniferous forest, the minimum dynamic habitat index, the minimum temperature of the coldest month, and the distance from town. Moose responds to these variables nonlinearly. Generally, variables related to human disturbance and heat stress are the main drivers of moose occurrence and are negatively associated with moose occurrence probability. High suitability areas are mainly distributed in eastern and northern Greater Khingan Mountains. Highly suitable habitat covers only a small proportion of the study area.

rayyan-220226231,Combining Multispectral and Radar Imagery with Machine Learning Techniques to Map Intertidal Habitats for Migratory Shorebirds,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Migratory shorebirds are notable consumers of benthic invertebrates on intertidal sediments. The distribution and abundance of shorebirds will strongly depend on their prey and on landscape and sediment features such as mud and surface water content, topography, and the presence of ecosystem engineers. An understanding of shorebird distribution and ecology thus requires knowledge of the various habitat types which may be distinguished in intertidal areas. Here, we combine Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 imagery and a digital elevation model (DEM), using machine learning techniques to map intertidal habitat types of importance to migratory shorebirds and their benthic prey. We do this on the third most important non-breeding area for migratory shorebirds in the East Atlantic Flyway, in the Bijagós Archipelago in West Africa. Using pixel-level random forests, we successfully mapped rocks, shell beds, and macroalgae and distinguished between areas of bare sediment and areas occupied by fiddler crabs, an ecosystem engineer that promotes significant bioturbation on intertidal flats. We also classified two sediment types (sandy and mixed) within the bare sediment and fiddler crab areas, according to their mud content. The overall classification accuracy was 82%, and the Kappa Coefficient was 73%. The most important predictors were elevation, the Sentinel-2-derived water and moisture indexes, and Sentinel-1 VH band. The association of Sentinel-2 with Sentinel-1 and a DEM produced the best results compared to the models without these variables. This map provides an overall picture of the composition of the intertidal habitats in a site of international importance for migratory shorebirds. Most of the intertidal flats of the Bijagós Archipelago are covered by bare sandy sediments (59%), and ca. 22% is occupied by fiddler crabs. This likely has significant implications for the spatial arrangement of the shorebird and benthic invertebrate communities due to the ecosystem engineering by the fiddler crabs, which promotes two vastly different intertidal species assemblages. This large-scale mapping provides an important product for the future monitoring of this high biodiversity area, particularly for ecological research related to the distribution and feeding ecology of the shorebirds and their prey. Such information is key from a conservation and management perspective. By delivering a successful and comprehensive mapping workflow, we contribute to the filling of the current knowledge gap on the application of remote sensing and machine learning techniques within intertidal areas, which are among the most challenging environments to map using remote sensing techniques.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/rs14143260,"",,

Efficient deforestation detection techniques are essential to monitor and control illegal logging, thus reducing forest loss and carbon emissions in the Amazon rainforest.

Moreover, the deforestation detection application is characterized by a high class imbalance, as recent deforestation areas usually represent a small fraction of the geographic extents being monitored. In order to produce a lightweight architecture in terms of the number of learnable parameters and address the high class imbalance of the deforestation detection application, we propose a DL model based on the GhostNet architecture, which combines Ghost modules in a fully convolutional architecture. The proposed architecture also includes Spatial Attention Mechanisms attached to the skip connections of the GhostNet in order to better capture the spatial relationships among class features.

rayyan-220226251,Merging and Downscaling Soil Moisture Data From CMIP6 Projections Using Deep Learning Method,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Soil moisture (SM) is an important variable in mediating the land-atmosphere interactions. Earth System Models (ESMs) are the key tools for predicting the response of SM to future climate change. Many ESMs provide outputs for SM; however, the estimated SM accuracy from different ESMs varies geographically as each ESM has its advantages and limitations. This study aimed to develop a merged SM product with improved accuracy and spatial resolution in China for 2015-2100 through data fusion of 25 ESMs with a deep-learning (DL) method. A DL model that can simultaneously perform data fusion and spatial downscaling was used to analyze SM’s future trend in China. Through the model, monthly SM data in four future scenarios (SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, SSP5-8.5) from 2015 to 2100, with a high resolution at 0.25°, was obtained. The evaluation metrics include mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square difference (RMSD), unbiased root mean square difference (ubRMSD), and coefficient of correlation (r). The evaluation results showed that our merged SM product is significantly better than each of the ESMs and the ensemble mean of all ESMs in terms of accuracy and spatial distribution. In the temporal dimension, the merged product is equivalent to the original data after deviation correction and equivalent to reconstructing the fluctuation of the whole series in a high error area. By further analyzing the spatiotemporal patterns of SM with the merged product in China, we found that northeast China will become wetter whereas South China will become drier. Northwest China and the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau would change from wetting to drying under a medium emission scenario. From the temporal scale of the results, the rate of SM variations is accelerated with time in the future under different scenarios. This study demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed procedure for simultaneous data fusion and spatial downscaling to generate improved SM data. The merged data have great practical and scientific implications.","",https://doi.org/10.3389/fenvs.2022.847475,"",,

We propose an approach based on a combination of remote sensing data and meteorological variables to reconstruct the spatiotemporal variation of net ecosystem exchange from eddy-covariance stations. A Lagrangian particle dispersion model was used for upscaling satellite images and flux towers. We trained data-driven models based on kernel methods separately for each selected land-cover class. The results suggest that the proposed approach to quantifying carbon exchange on a medium-to-large scale by blending eddy covariance flux data with moderate resolution satellite and weather data provides a set of key advantages over previously deployed methods: (1) scalability, achieved via the validation design based on a separate set of eddy covariance stations; (2) high spatial and temporal resolution thanks to the use of Landsat imagery; and (3) robust and accurate predictions due to improved data quality control, advanced machine learning techniques, and rigorous validation. The machine learning models yielded high cross-validation results. Stratification that uses separate Fluxnet stations for each fold of validation ensures that the models are accurate across the area covered by the Fluxnet sites. Overall, we present here a globally scaled technology for the land sector based on high resolution remote sensing imagery, meteorological variables, and direct carbon flux measurements of eddy covariance flux stations.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/rs14215529,"",,

Dausa city and its surroundings of Rajasthan, India has been selected for this study for several reasons including arid climatic setting being a sensitive precursor to the climate change scenarios and the huge population pressure experienced by the area. The MLP based supervised classification for two periods 2001 and 2018 have been analyzed using Landsat 7 Thermal Mapper (TM) and Landsat 8 OLI satellite images. The images were classified into six LULC categories viz. Built-up (Settlements), Cultivated Lands (Agricultural/Cropland), Water Body, Uncultivated/Fallow Lands, Barren Lands, and Forest/Vegetation cover. The accuracy assessment for both classified images was performed using confusion matrix led Kappa Coefficient (K) technique. Reasonable accuracies, K=0.82 (2001) &amp; K = 0.91 (2018), have been achieved for datasets selected for both periods of time. The MLP-MC model based spatiotemporal LULC prediction for the year 2045, using the trends in the classified LULC results for the period 2001-2018, prophecies that the ‘built-up land’ would increase to reach 76.10 km2 (67.60% increase) in 2045 with the reference year 2001 whereas the increase in this class of LULC would only be 39.34% during the period 2018-2045. The ‘cultivated land’ (2001-2045: -83.86%; 2018-2045: -65.20%), ‘barren land’, (2001-2045: -54.70%; 2018-2045: -4.86%), ‘water body’ (2001-2045: -96.43%; 2018-2045: -84.42%), and ‘forest/vegetation’ (2001-2045: -81.94%; 2018-2045: -20.59%), categories would experience continuous areal decline over this period, though some at faster pace and other at comparatively lower rate. The projected unprecedented exponential increase in ‘follow land/uncultivated land’ (2001-2045: +372.45%; 2018-2045: +6.39%) presents worrisome future picture of this ecologically sensitive and fragile region. The results of this study indicate and warrant intensive management and policy, and local level participation of communities to help maintain the deteriorating ecological balance in this ecologically sensitive arid ecosystem with fragile agricultural and natural vegetation traits.","",https://doi.org/10.1088/1755-1315/1032/1/012028,"",,
rayyan-220226282,Application of Machine Learning Techniques to Ocean Mooring Time Series Data,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract In situ observations are vital to improving our understanding of the variability and dynamics of the ocean. A critical component of the ocean circulation is the strong, narrow, and highly variable western boundary currents. Ocean moorings that extend from the seafloor to the surface remain the most effective and efficient method to fully observe these currents. For various reasons, mooring instruments may not provide continuous records. Here we assess the application of the Iterative Completion Self-Organizing Maps (ITCOMPSOM) machine learning technique to fill observational data gaps in a 7.5 yr time series of the East Australian Current. The method was validated by withholding parts of fully known profiles, and reconstructing them. For 20% random withholding of known velocity data, validation statistics of the u - and υ -velocity components are R 2 coefficients of 0.70 and 0.88 and root-mean-square errors of 0.038 and 0.064 m s −1 , respectively. Withholding 100 days of known velocity profiles over a depth range between 60 and 700 m has mean profile residual differences between true and predicted u and υ velocity of 0.009 and 0.02 m s −1 , respectively. The ITCOMPSOM also reproduces the known velocity variability. For 20% withholding of salinity and temperature data, root-mean-square errors of 0.04 and 0.38°C, respectively, are obtained. The ITCOMPSOM validation statistics are significantly better than those obtained when standard data filling methods are used. We suggest that machine learning techniques can be an appropriate method to fill missing data and enable production of observational-derived data products. Significance Statement Moored observational time series of ocean boundary currents monitor the full-depth variability and change of these dynamic currents and are used to understand their influence on large-scale ocean climate, regional shelf–coastal processes, extreme weather, and seasonal climate. In this study we apply a machine learning technique, Iterative Completion Self-Organizing Maps (ITCOMPSOM), to fill data gaps in a boundary current moored observational data record. The ITCOMPSOM provides an improved method to fill data gaps in the mooring record and if applied to other observational data records may improve the reconstruction of missing data. The derived gridded data product should improve the accessibility and potentially increase the use of these data.","",https://doi.org/10.1175/jtech-d-21-0183.1,"",,
rayyan-220226310,RTM Inversion through Predictive Equations for Multi-Crop LAI Retrieval Using Sentinel-2 Images,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Near-real-time, high-spatial-resolution leaf area index (LAI) maps would enable producers to monitor crop health and growth status, improving agricultural practices such as fertiliser and water management. LAI retrieval methods are numerous and can be divided into statistical and physically based methods. While statistical methods are generally subject to high site-specificity but possess high ease of implementation and use, physically based methods are more transferable, albeit more complex to use in operational settings. In addition, statistical methods need a large amount of data for calibration and subsequent validation, and this is only seldom feasible. Techniques based on predictive equations (PEphysical) represent a viable alternative, allowing the partial combination of statistical and physical methods merits while minimising their shortcomings. In this paper, predictive equation-based techniques were compared with four other methods: two radiative transfer model (RTM) inversion methods, one based on neural network (NNET) and one based on a look-up table (LUT), and two empirical methods (one using empirical models based on vegetation indices and in situ data and one based on empirical models found in the scientific literature). The methods were chosen based on common use. To evaluate the performance of the studied methods, the coefficient of determination (R2), root mean square error (RMSE), and normalised root mean square error (nRMSE, %) between the estimates and in situ LAI measurements were reported. The best PEphysical results, achieved by the OSAVI index (RMSE = 0.84 m2 m−2), provided better performance for LAI recovery than the NNET-based RTM inversions (0.86 m2 m−2) or the estimates made by LUT (0.94 m2 m−2). Furthermore, the best PEphysical produced accuracies comparable to the best empirical model (RMSE = 0.71 m2 m−2), calibrated through in situ data, and similar to the best literature model (RMSE = 0.76 m2 m−2). These results indicated that PEphysical can be used to recover LAI with transferability comparable to literature models.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/agronomy12112835,"",,

However, palm cover at macroecological scales has not yet been quantified in this biome. Here, we used high spatial resolution LiDAR data, acquired from 610 flightlines over the Brazilian Amazon, to map canopy palm cover for the first time using a deep learning approach. The image segmentation model from U‐Net deep learning was selected for mapping palm segments using the LiDAR canopy height model (CHM) at 0.5‐m spatial resolution. To train and validate the model, we manually delineated 6971 canopy palm segments over 931.43 ha of forests on four training sites by inspecting their unique star‐shaped crown architecture in the CHM. The results indicated an accuracy of 80% to automatically map canopy palm area. The approach detected &gt;1.1 million palm segments over the 480 000 ha sampled by LiDAR and roughly estimated 1.05 billion palm segments for the Brazilian Amazon. Palm cover was not evenly distributed over the Amazon, revealing undocumented hotspots of high cover (&gt;5%) in eastern Amazon (Pará state), and confirming documented hotspots in southwest (Acre state) and north of the region (Roraima state). Palm segment height was strongly and positively correlated with forest height, where palm segments showed overall lower height. A higher canopy palm cover was observed over shorter forests, while the opposite was found over taller forests, where palms may not be visible from the canopy. Palm segments occurred more frequently at valleys but they were also observed in other landscapes, depending on site location and forest height. Our findings highlight the disproportional occurrence of palm cover in some Amazonian canopies. This fact should be taken into account to improve regional carbon cycle representation and promote initiatives of biodiversity conservation and bioeconomic use of these forests.","",https://doi.org/10.1002/rse2.264,"",,
rayyan-220226433,Ensemble Machine Learning Outperforms Empirical Equations for the Ground Heat Flux Estimation with Remote Sensing Data,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Estimating evapotranspiration at field scale is a major component of sustainable water management. Due to the difficulty to assess some major unknowns of the water cycle at that scale, including irrigation amounts, evapotranspiration is often computed as the residual of the instantaneous surface energy budget. One of the Surface Energy Bal-ance components with the largest uncertainties in their quantification over bare soils and sparse vegetation areas is the ground heat flux (G). Over the last decades, the es-timation of G with RS data has been mainly achieved with empirical equations, on the basis of the G and net radiation (Rn) ratio, G/Rn. G/Rn empirical equations generally require vegetation data (Type I empirical equations), in combination with surface tem-perature (Ts) and albedo (Type II empirical equations). In this article we aim to evalu-ate the estimation of G with RS. For the first time, we compare eight G/Rn empirical equations against two types of machine learning (ML) methods: an ensemble ML type, the Random Forest (RF), and the Neural Networks (NN). The comparison of each method is evaluated over dense dataset, including a wide range of climate and land covers, with data of Eddy-Covariance towers extended along the mid-latitude area that encompass the European and African continent. Our results have shown evidence that the driver of G in bare soils and sparse vegetation areas (Fraction of Vegetation, Fv &amp;lt;= 0.25) is Ts, instead of vegetation greenness indexes. On the other hand, the estimation of G with Rn, Ts or Fv decreases at dense vegetation areas (Fv &amp;gt;= 0.50). There are not significant differences between the most accurate type I and II empirical equations. For bare soils and sparse vegetation areas the empirical equation that better estimates G is E8, which combines the Leaf Area Index (LAI) and Ts. In dense vegetation areas (Fv &amp;gt;= 0.25), an exponential empirical equation based on Fv (E4), shows the best performance. However, ML better estimates G than the empirical equations, independently of the Fv ranges. A RF model with Rn, LAI and Ts as predictor variables shows the best accuracy and performance metrics, outperforming the NN model.","",https://doi.org/10.20944/preprints202202.0199.v1,"",,

Understanding temporal dynamics in rangeland gross primary production (GPP) and how it may change under projected future climate, including more frequent and severe droughts, is critical for ranching communities to cope with future changes. Herein, we examined how climate regulates the interannual variability of GPP in California’s diverse annual rangeland, based on the contemporary records of satellite derived GPP at 500 m resolution since 2001. We built Gradient Boosted Regression Tree models for 23 ecoregion subsections, relating annual GPP with 30 climatic variables, to disentangle the partial dependence of GPP on each climate variable. The machine learning results showed that GPP was most sensitive to growing season (GS) precipitation, with a reduction in GPP up to 200 g cm −2 yr −1 when GS precipitation decreased from 400 to 100 mm yr −1 in one of the driest subsections. We also found that years with more evenly distributed GS precipitation had higher GPP. Warmer winter minimum air temperature enhanced GPP in approximately two-thirds of the subsections. In contrast, average GS air temperatures showed a negative relationship with annual GPP. When the pre-trained models were forced by downscaled future climate projections, changes in the predicted rangeland productivity by mid- and end of century were more remarkable at the ecoregion subsection scale than at the state level. Our machine learning-based analysis highlights key regional differences in GPP vulnerability to climate and provides insights on the intertwining and potentially counteracting effects of seasonal temperature and precipitation regimes.

Herein, we examined how climate regulates temporal dynamics of annual GPP in California’s annual rangeland across scales, based on 20 years of satellite record derived GPP at 500-meter resolution since 2001. We built gradient boosted regression tree models for 23 ecoregion subsections in our study area, relating annual GPP with 30 climatic variables and disentangling the partial dependence of GPP on each climate variable. Our analysis showed that GPP was most sensitive to growing season precipitation amount; GPP decrease as much as 200 g C/m 2 /yr when growing season precipitation decreased from 400 to 100 mm/yr in one of the driest subsections. We also found that years with more evenly distributed growing season precipitation had higher GPP. Warmer winter minimum air temperature enhanced GPP in approximately two-thirds of the subsections. In contrast, average growing season mean and maximum air temperatures showed a negative relationship with annual GPP. When forced by downscaled future climate projections, changes in future rangeland productivity at the ecoregion subsection scale were more remarkable than at the state level; this suggests rangeland productivity responses to climate change will be highly variable at the local level. Further, we found large uncertainty in precipitation projections among the four climate models used in this study. Specifically, drier models predicted a larger degree of reduction in GPP, especially in drier subsections. Our machine learning-based analysis highlights key regional differences in GPP vulnerability to climate and provides insights into the intertwining and potentially counteracting effects of seasonal temperature and precipitation regimes.

Functional diversity is increasingly recognized as a critical link between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. Satellite earth observation was proposed to address the current absence of information on large-scale continuous patterns of plant functional diversity. This study demonstrates the inference and spatial mapping of functional diversity metrics through satellite remote sensing over a large key biodiversity region (Sabah, Malaysian Borneo, ~53,000 km2) and compares the derived estimates across a land-use gradient as an initial qualitative assessment to test the potential merits of the approach. Functional traits (leaf water content, chlorophyll-a and -b, and leaf area index) were estimated from Sentinel-2 spectral reflectance using a pre-trained neural network on radiative transfer modeling simulations. Multivariate functional diversity metrics were calculated, including functional richness, divergence, and evenness. Spatial patterns of functional diversity were related to land-use data distinguishing intact forest, logged forest, and oil palm plantations. Spatial patterns of satellite remotely sensed functional diversity are significantly related to differences in land use. Intact forests, as well as logged forests, featured consistently higher functional diversity compared to oil palm plantations. Differences were profound for functional divergence, whereas functional richness exhibited relatively large variances within land-use classes. By linking large-scale patterns of functional diversity as derived from satellite remote sensing to land-use information, this study indicated initial responsiveness to broad human disturbance gradients over large geographical and spatially contiguous extents. Despite uncertainties about the accuracy of the spatial patterns, this study provides a coherent early application of satellite-derived functional diversity toward further validation of its responsiveness across ecological gradients.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/land11040572,"",,

rayyan-220226631,Hybrid Modeling of Evapotranspiration: Inferring Stomatal and Aerodynamic Resistances Using Combined Physics-Based and Machine Learning,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"The process of evapotranspiration transfers water vapour from vegetation and soil surfaces to the atmosphere, the so-called latent heat flux (𝑄 LE), and thus crucially modulates Earth’s energy, water, and carbon cycles. Vegetation controls 𝑄 LE through regulating the leaf stomata (i.e., surface resistance 𝑟 s) and through altering surface roughness (aerodynamic resistance 𝑟 a). Estimating 𝑟 s and 𝑟 a across different vegetation types proves to be a key challenge in predicting 𝑄 LE. Here, we propose a hybrid modeling approach (i.e., combining mechanistic modeling and machine learning) for 𝑄 LE where neural networks independently learn the resistances from observations as intermediate variables. In our hybrid modeling setup, we make use of the Penman-Monteith equation based on the Big Leaf theory in conjunction with multi-year flux measurements across different forest and grassland sites from the FLUXNET database. We follow two conceptually different strategies to constrain the hybrid model to control for equifinality arising when estimating the two resistances simultaneously. One strategy is to impose an a priori constraint on 𝑟 a based on our mechanistic understanding (theory-driven strategy), while the other strategy makes use of more observational data and adds a constraint in predicting 𝑟 a through multi-task learning of the latent as well as the sensible heat flux (𝑄 H ; data-driven strategy). Our results show that all hybrid models exhibit a fairly high predictive skill for the target variables with 𝑅 2 = 0.82-0.89 for grasslands and 𝑅 2 = 0.70-0.80 for forests sites at the mean diurnal scale. The predictions of 𝑟 s and 𝑟 a show physical consistency across the two regularized hybrid models, but are physically implausible in the under-constrained hybrid model. The hybrid models are robust in reproducing consistent results for energy fluxes and resistances across different scales (diurnal, seasonal, interannual), reflecting their ability to learn the physical dependence of the target variables on the meteorological inputs. As a next step, we propose to test these heavily observation-informed parameterizations derived through hybrid modeling as a substitute for overly simple ad hoc formulations in Earth system models.","",https://doi.org/10.1002/essoar.10512258.1,"",,

Timely understanding of land cover and its changes before and after earthquakes is of great scientific significance for studying the restoration and reconstruction of the natural ecosystem and the sustainable development of the social economy in disaster areas. At present, there are few studies on land cover changes before and after earthquakes in the earthquake-stricken areas, especially the quantitative assessment of land cover changes before and after earthquakes at the micro scale of landscape spatial distribution. Therefore, this article is based on remote sensing data and uses an earthquake in Jiuzhaigou, Sichuan, as an example. By calculating the land-use degree comprehensive index and its rate of change, the transfer matrix of land-use, quantitative expression methods of the landscape via the landscape pattern index are analyzed from the points of view of the spatial–temporal evolution law of the landscape pattern of land cover before and after the earthquake. The experimental results showed that the area of forest, cropland, shrub. and grassland types in the study area changed greatly, and the area of grassland types in Shuanghe Township changed most obviously, as they increased from 6.57 km2 in 2015 to 7.43 km2, and then decreased to 6.21 km2 in 2020. During the earthquake recovery period, the comprehensive index of land-use degree for most towns in the study area showed an upward trend, and the land cover types were improved. After 2017, the PD and LSI of the study area showed a downward trend, among which the bare land type changed greatly, with the PD value decreasing from 0.38 in 2017 to 0.21 in 2020, and the LSI value decreasing from 58.29 in 2017 to 40.69 in 2020. This indicates that the degree of landscape fragmentation and the spatial heterogeneity of the land surface in the study area are reduced in the later stage of earthquake recovery. After 2017, the AI value of the study area showed an upward trend, and the AI value of the bare land type increased from 63.97 in 2017 to 78.25 in 2020, indicating that the connectivity between landscape patches in the study area was enhanced in the later stage of the earthquake. This also reflects that the ecological environment of the study area gradually showed a good trend in the later stage of the earthquake. The results of this paper not only reveal the spatial–temporal evolution of land cover in Jiuzhaigou County before and after the earthquake, but also help the relevant national decision-making departments to formulate corresponding policies and measures.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/su142013032,"",,

Plankton functional diversity is at the core of various ecological processes, including productivity, carbon cycling and sequestration, nutrient cycling (Falkowski 2012), interspecies interactions, and food web dynamics and structure (D'Alelio et al. 2016). Through these functions, plankton play a critical role in the health of the coastal and open ocean and provide essential ecosystem services. Yet, at present, our understanding of plankton dynamics is insufficient to project how climate change and other human-driven impacts affect the functional diversity of plankton.

Participants discussed possible actions to overcome these challenges and limitations. There was agreement that observations in natural ocean habitats are fundamental to the formulation and testing of new hypotheses and conceptual models. More active communication between data providers and users will benefit the data collection, interpretation and analysis, and usability. For example, data that allow quantifying relationships among species traits (e.g., size, stoichiometry) will help inform understanding of species responses to environmental conditions. Although participants agreed that there is a lack of standardization of methods, data formatting, and distribution methods, in addition to a paucity of information on data quality and uncertainty, they also recognized the challenges of establishing a global protocol for field practices considering the regional environmental differences. For example, a net with a smaller mesh size is needed in tropical regions because plankton body size generally declines with warming (Campbell et al. 2021), in contrast a net with a larger mesh size which is towed faster is needed if the target is euphausiids rather than copepods. As a solution, participants suggested the use, further expansion, and explanation of existing protocols as best practices, and the set of minimum data and measurements required for data synthesis be laid out. Additionally, the creation of a community-driven unit conversion policy will help to normalize datasets and allow for a better understanding of variability and uncertainty. These approaches can help develop and validate models and minimize the uncertainty in data-driven meta-analysis studies. It was also agreed that, as a community, we need to build capacity at three levels: taxonomic ability, data science, and data management. We need to highlight the fundamental role of taxonomists in providing high-quality data, and of data scientists for data-driven meta-analysis and synthesis. Databases should follow Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reuse principles, to credit and recognize the original data providers. Sufficient funds for the curation and archiving of project data should be included in future funding proposals at the national and international levels. Participants identified the ideal scenario for data users is interlinked data repositories, standardized conversion tables, interoperable data collection protocols, and documented uncertainty levels. Each is a rather challenging task. As a first step, participants recommend an inventory of plankton databases with a summary of their holdings such as the geographic area covered, time covered, types of plankton data included, and information on data format and access (e.g., GOOS Biology and Ecosystems Panel, https://www.goosocean.org/index.php?option=com_oe&task=viewGroupRecord&groupID=339, last accessed date: 28 Jan 2022). The value of plankton is mainly invisible and difficult to quantify, mostly because the public is aware of the ultimate ecosystem service delivered, but not the underlying ecosystem functions of organisms that deliver that service (e.g., the connection of plankton to fish and fisheries). That is, plankton are valuable through their provisioning of ecological and biogeochemical services that enhance the cultural and economic value of the marine environment. They are responsible for approximately half of the Earth's oxygen production and photosynthetic carbon fixation (Field et al. 1998), and play the fundamental “bio” role in biogeochemical cycling of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and many other elements. They are linked through the food web to higher trophic levels and generate economic and recreational benefits for humans. Plankton are involved in feedback processes that affect the evolution and survival of all marine species (Falkowski 2012), and promote marine biodiversity such as fish, benthic organisms, marine and even terrestrial birds, and mammals. Many participants highlighted that although public awareness of the value of the services provided by plankton are often unrecognized, plankton is usually known for negative reasons, such as blooms of pathogenic bacteria, harmful algae, or jellyfish. The value of plankton to policy makers and the public can be highlighted by quantifying in economic terms and illustrating the link between plankton biodiversity and things we value (e.g., iconic species, recreational activities, water quality, carbon storage, nature conservation). Citizen science, education, science-art projects, and outreach activities are important ways to raise this awareness. There are many plankton-related outreach activities for all ages, but as outreach is commonly the least-funded component of scientific projects, it is imperative that we find ways to advance them. Models, virtual reality, and artificial intelligence could also be further developed as heuristic educational tools. One way to improve awareness is to integrate social scientists and those involved with science advice and policy into the development of research grants, approach mass media communication, and also consider opportunities presented by the Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development (2021–2030) as proclaimed by the United Nations (https://en.unesco.org/ocean-decade, last accessed date: 22 Dec 2021).

rayyan-220226671,A 1-km daily soil moisture dataset of China based on in-situ measurement using machine learning,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract. High quality gridded soil moisture products are essential for many Earth system science applications, and they are usually available from remote sensing or model simulations with coarse resolution. Here we present a 1 km resolution long-term dataset of soil moisture derived through machine learning trained with in-situ measurements of 1,789 stations, named as SMCI1.0. Random Forest is used to predict soil moisture using ERA5-land time series, leaf area index, land cover type, topography and soil properties as covariates. SMCI1.0 provides 10-layer soil moisture with 10 cm intervals up to 100 cm deep at daily resolution over the period 2010–2020. Using in-situ soil moisture as the benchmark, two independent experiments are conducted to investigate the estimation accuracy of the SMCI1.0: year-to-year experiment (ubRMSE ranges from 0.041–0.052 and R ranges from 0.883–0.919) and station-to-station experiment (ubRMSE ranges from 0.045–0.051 and R ranges from 0.866–0.893). SMCI1.0 generally has advantages over other gridded soil moisture products, including ERA5-Land, SMAP-L4 and SoMo.ml. However, the high errors of soil moisture often located in North China Monsoon Region. Overall, the highly accurate estimations of both the year-to-year and station-to-station experiments ensure the applicability of SMCI1.0 to studies on the spatial-temporal patterns. As SMCI1.0 is based on in-situ data, it can be useful complements of existing model-based and satellite-based datasets for various hydrological, meteorological, and ecological analyses and modeling. SMCI1.0 can be accessed at http://dx.doi.org/10.11888/Terre.tpdc.272415 (Shangguan et al., 2022).","",https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-2022-177,"",,
rayyan-220226722,The combined impact of redcedar encroachment and climate change on water resources in the Nebraska Sand Hills,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"The Nebraska Sand Hills (NSH) is considered a major recharge zone for the High Plains Aquifer in the central United States. The uncontrolled expansion of the eastern redcedar ( Juniperus Virginiana ) under climate warming is posing threats to surface water and groundwater resources. The combined impact of land use and climate change on the water balance in the Upper Middle Loup River watershed (4,954 km 2 ) in the NSH was evaluated by simulating different combinations of model scenarios using the Soil Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model. A total of 222 climate models were ranked according to the aridity index and three models representing wet, median (most likely), and dry conditions were selected. Additionally, the impacts of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions on root water uptake were simulated. Four plausible redcedar encroachment scenarios, namely 0.5% (no encroachment), 2.4, 4.6, and 11.9%, were considered in the numerical simulations. We, therefore, built: i ) the historical scenario (2000–2019) with the current climate and redcedar cover leading to baseline results; ii ) the most-likely future scenario (2020–2099) with projected climate (50 th percentile of aridity index distribution) and redcedar encroachment that was estimated by using a combination of neural network and Markov-chain cellular automata model; iii ) 16 future scenarios (2020–2099) with different combinations of extreme climate (5 th and 95 th percentiles of aridity index distribution) and four hypothetical encroachment scenarios (0.5, 2.4, 4.6, and 11.9%). The most-likely climate projection indicates that a warming pattern will be expected with a 4.1°C increase in average over the 100-year period, and this will be associated with lower-than-normal precipitation (P). Nevertheless, the concurrent increase in temperature and CO 2 concentration is likely to induce stomata closure by reducing potential (ET p ) and actual (ET a ) evapotranspiration losses. Projected P and ET a are expected to decrease by 10 and 14% while recharge (R) and discharge (D) are expected to increase by 38 and 30% for the period 2020-2050. For the period 2051-2099, the projected P and ET a are expected to decrease by 8 and 32% while R and D are expected to increase by 140.2 and 40%. Finally, a sensitivity analysis of 16 combined climate and land use scenarios is presented and discussed. The scenario modeling approach presented in this paper can support decision-making by stakeholders for optimal management of water resources.","",https://doi.org/10.3389/frwa.2022.1044570,"",,

The spatio-temporal resolution and survey responsiveness afforded by these low-cost platforms enables the collection of data that can provide insights on the spatio-temporal dynamics of individual marine animals at close range (Anderson & Gaston, 2013). In the last decade there has been an increase in marine studies utilizing UAVs (Schofield et al., 2019), which allows for novel insights on the abundance (Hodgson et al., 2017), behavior (Fiori et al., 2020; Torres et al., 2018), and body condition (Christiansen et al., 2016; Hodgson et al., 2020) of marine wildlife. Importantly, UAV-based image capture has the potential to increase the duration of visible observation through detection of animals below the water surface (Torres et al., 2018). This has significant ramifications for the study of mother-calf humpback whale groups that rest in shallow protected embayments (Bruce et al., 2014; McCulloch et al., 2021), spending high proportions of time resting at depths of <5 m (Bejder et al., 2019; Iwata et al., 2021). However, the use of remotely sensed data in coastal environments is challenged by the optical complexity of the water column (Figure 1). Research until now has focused primarily on image detection based on the visual spectrum with limited evaluation of conventional remote sensing methods for enhancing observation of whales. Processing techniques are commonly used in remote sensing research to enhance or enable the detection of underwater features, including benthic habitat (Hedley et al., 2016; Mumby et al., 1998; Zoffoli et al., 2014). Similar techniques, including water column correction, can be applied to UAV-captured images to enhance visibility of animals below the water surface, which may be missed in manual counts or automated deep-learning based classifications (Gray et al., 2019). This paper presents remote sensing-based methods for enhancing UAV-acquired visual image data to improve the contrast of whales on the water surface and submerged near the surface. Application of these methods has the potential to reduce perception error (Colefax et al., 2018) and subsequently improve detection rates. The Jervis Bay Marine Park study site on the eastern Australian coastline is frequented by humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) mother-calf groups during the southern migration from the breeding grounds (Bruce et al., 2014; Jones, 2019). FIGURE 1Open in figure viewerPowerPoint Diagram illustrating the various processes contributing to complexities in surveying large marine species from a UAV platform. Created with BioRender (https://biorender.com/). The visible RGB imaging capabilities of sensors for detecting whales were evaluated using a DJI Mavic 2 Enterprise Dual (M2ED) launched from a small boat in Jervis Bay. Following a confirmed whale sighting, the whale's behavior and direction of travel were observed for 5 min from the boat at a distance >300 m before an approach was made to a distance >100 m from the whale. The UAV was launched to an initial altitude of 55 m to provide sufficient sensor field of view for whale identification and lowered to ≥25 m once whale(s) were visible on the controller screen. The boat remained at a distance >100 m from the whales during the flights to provide a visual line of sight to the UAV and facilitate positioning over the whales. Still images and videos were captured throughout each flight. Lyzenga's water column correction (Lyzenga, 1981) as modified by Mumby et al. (1998) and Hamylton (2011) was applied to three UAV images containing humpback whales (steps summarized in Figure 2). To enhance the spectral signature of the whale, radiance values were taken from transects along and across the whale's body surface to account for the fusiform shape of the whale (Step 3, Figure 2). This method, suitable for high clarity water, produces a depth-invariant band based on each pair of spectral (wavelength) bands (Mumby et al., 1998). This generated three depth invariant bands from the available spectral band pairs (red/green, red/blue, green/blue). To allow for comparison between the original image and processed images, all pixels were converted into Z-scores (Z = [pixel value − mean]/standard deviation), enabling detection of anomalies. The performance of the applied image processing methods was assessed visually (Figure 3), and quantitively by evaluating the mean Z-score values (Table 1) extracted across the whale's surface for the original RGB images and the three resulting band pairs. FIGURE 2Open in figure viewerPowerPoint Overview of processing steps applied in the depth invariant analysis. In Step 3, the yellow transect outlines where the radiance values were extracted for inclusion in the correction. The correction process resulted in three depth-invariant band pairs. These images were then converted into Z-scores and transects (black dotted line, Step 4) were extracted along the length of the whale to determine average values for each image. FIGURE 3Open in figure viewerPowerPoint Results of depth-invariant processing for three UAV images.

TABLE 1. Mean Z-scores extracted across the whales in the three images from Figure 3, presenting results from the RGB image and three depth-invariant band pairs. The results from the RGB image are presented as individual red, green, and blue bands. The highest value for each image is shown in bold. Mean Z-scores Image A Image B Image C Red 1.00 0.85 0.40 Green −0.28 0.90 0.07 Blue −0.45 0.54 −0.08 Red/green 2.21 0.67 1.85 Red/blue 2.11 1.05 1.88 Green/blue 0.32 1.64 1.25 Application of Lyzenga's water column correction enhanced the contrast and edge definition between whales and surrounding water in the three UAV-captured images presented here. For whales on or just below the surface, the red/green and red/blue depth-invariant band pairs were the most effective band pair combination for enhancing contrast between the whale and surrounding waters, both visually (Figure 3A and C) and resulting in the highest anomaly values (Table 1). The effectiveness of the red band for animals on or near the surface is consistent with findings from Colefax et al. (2021), who demonstrated the red band produced the greatest spectral contrast for detecting dolphins, sharks, and other marine fauna from a UAV. At increasing depths, the green/blue band pair produced a stronger visual contrast and highest anomaly result (Figure 3B; Table 1) owing to the red waveband becoming attenuated at greater depth. The depth of the target animal(s) will influence the optimal band pairing and subsequent object enhancement within the image. The red band (610–700 nm), and other bands with wavelengths approaching the red end of the spectrum (e.g., red edge and near infrared), will become fully attenuated around 2–3 m depth (Hamylton, 2011; Mishra et al., 2005). Thus, the effectiveness of band pairs using the red band will be substantially reduced at this depth. However, in turbid waters, where sightability below the surface is limited, longer wavelength bands may be optimal for increasing the contrast of animals just below the surface (Colefax et al., 2021). Image enhancement methods for improving whale detection rates even in optically shallow waters (<2–3 m) has important implications for studies reliant on whale visibility, such as estimating abundance (e.g., Hodgson et al., 2017). This is key for research conducted on breeding/resting grounds, with lactating females and their calves spending over 50% of time within 3 m of the surface (Bejder et al., 2019). The methods presented here have the potential to increase the confidence of machine learning and automated detection models. Machine learning techniques for automated detection of whales are increasingly being applied to UAV-collected data sets providing an efficient way to process large amounts of data. Studies using machine learning to detect individual animals or plants rely on the detection of target objects against mostly homogenous backgrounds which typically rely on a clear contrast to reliably discriminate animals from their surrounding environment (Laliberte & Ripple, 2003). The use of machine learning for detecting marine vertebrates is further complicated by coloration similarities between some species and the surrounding water (e.g., blue whales; Gray et al., 2019) and nonuniform backgrounds that are subject to varying environmental conditions. In ecological studies, object-based image analysis (OBIA) is the most commonly used machine learning method (Dujon & Schofield, 2019). It provides versatility for detecting objects in varied backgrounds with confounding features, objects that vary in size and shape, and may be sparsely distributed in the image data set (Chabot et al., 2018), making it ideal for abundance and distribution studies. Importantly, even with increased flexibility over other machine learning methods, OBIA is still reliant on the object(s) of interest in the image being localized from surrounding pixels through a local brightness contrast, either as a relatively brighter or relatively darker group of image pixels (Groom et al., 2013). For whale detection, increasing the anomaly (Z-score) of the whale object, as demonstrated here, could potentially improve OBIA-derived results and increase detection availability. Here we have demonstrated that water column correction techniques can enhance the visual outline and anomaly signal over the body of whales on the surface and submerged at shallow depths. However, we recognize constraints associated with the limited spectral resolution provided when working with three bands (i.e., red, green, and blue) within the visible range (wavelength 400–700 nm). Employing multispectral or hyperspectral sensors and customizing or selecting bands configured to focus on wavelength bands optimal for the spectral characteristics of the water body, such as the coastal band (Fretwell et al., 2014), and target species may further reduce perception bias and subsequently improve animal availability at depth compared to standard RGB sensors (Colefax et al., 2018). Additionally, obtaining a larger image data set is critical for understanding the effectiveness of depth invariant indices derived from possible band pairs, and whether these differ with the whale depth and environmental factors (e.g., turbidity). Ultimately, an understanding of the role of water column attenuation correction is critical for accurate detection of whales and is particularly relevant with the increasing use of low-cost UAV platforms and machine learning techniques for achieving estimates of population abundance and monitoring movement patterns of marine wildlife in shallow coastal habitats.

The spatio-temporal resolution and survey responsiveness afforded by these low-cost platforms enables the collection of data that can provide insights on the spatio-temporal dynamics of individual marine animals at close range (Anderson & Gaston, 2013). In the last decade there has been an increase in marine studies utilizing UAVs (Schofield et al., 2019), which allows for novel insights on the abundance (Hodgson et al., 2017), behavior (Fiori et al., 2020; Torres et al., 2018), and body condition (Christiansen et al., 2016; Hodgson et al., 2020) of marine wildlife. Importantly, UAV-based image capture has the potential to increase the duration of visible observation through detection of animals below the water surface (Torres et al., 2018). This has significant ramifications for the study of mother-calf humpback whale groups that rest in shallow protected embayments (Bruce et al., 2014; McCulloch et al., 2021), spending high proportions of time resting at depths of <5 m (Bejder et al., 2019; Iwata et al., 2021). However, the use of remotely sensed data in coastal environments is challenged by the optical complexity of the water column (Figure 1). Research until now has focused primarily on image detection based on the visual spectrum with limited evaluation of conventional remote sensing methods for enhancing observation of whales. Processing techniques are commonly used in remote sensing research to enhance or enable the detection of underwater features, including benthic habitat (Hedley et al., 2016; Mumby et al., 1998; Zoffoli et al., 2014). Similar techniques, including water column correction, can be applied to UAV-captured images to enhance visibility of animals below the water surface, which may be missed in manual counts or automated deep-learning based classifications (Gray et al., 2019). This paper presents remote sensing-based methods for enhancing UAV-acquired visual image data to improve the contrast of whales on the water surface and submerged near the surface. Application of these methods has the potential to reduce perception error (Colefax et al., 2018) and subsequently improve detection rates. The Jervis Bay Marine Park study site on the eastern Australian coastline is frequented by humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) mother-calf groups during the southern migration from the breeding grounds (Bruce et al., 2014; Jones, 2019). FIGURE 1Open in figure viewerPowerPoint Diagram illustrating the various processes contributing to complexities in surveying large marine species from a UAV platform. Created with BioRender (https://biorender.com/). The visible RGB imaging capabilities of sensors for detecting whales were evaluated using a DJI Mavic 2 Enterprise Dual (M2ED) launched from a small boat in Jervis Bay. Following a confirmed whale sighting, the whale's behavior and direction of travel were observed for 5 min from the boat at a distance >300 m before an approach was made to a distance >100 m from the whale. The UAV was launched to an initial altitude of 55 m to provide sufficient sensor field of view for whale identification and lowered to ≥25 m once whale(s) were visible on the controller screen. The boat remained at a distance >100 m from the whales during the flights to provide a visual line of sight to the UAV and facilitate positioning over the whales. Still images and videos were captured throughout each flight. Lyzenga's water column correction (Lyzenga, 1981) as modified by Mumby et al. (1998) and Hamylton (2011) was applied to three UAV images containing humpback whales (steps summarized in Figure 2). To enhance the spectral signature of the whale, radiance values were taken from transects along and across the whale's body surface to account for the fusiform shape of the whale (Step 3, Figure 2). This method, suitable for high clarity water, produces a depth-invariant band based on each pair of spectral (wavelength) bands (Mumby et al., 1998). This generated three depth invariant bands from the available spectral band pairs (red/green, red/blue, green/blue). To allow for comparison between the original image and processed images, all pixels were converted into Z-scores (Z = [pixel value − mean]/standard deviation), enabling detection of anomalies. The performance of the applied image processing methods was assessed visually (Figure 3), and quantitively by evaluating the mean Z-score values (Table 1) extracted across the whale's surface for the original RGB images and the three resulting band pairs. FIGURE 2Open in figure viewerPowerPoint Overview of processing steps applied in the depth invariant analysis. In Step 3, the yellow transect outlines where the radiance values were extracted for inclusion in the correction. The correction process resulted in three depth-invariant band pairs. These images were then converted into Z-scores and transects (black dotted line, Step 4) were extracted along the length of the whale to determine average values for each image. FIGURE 3Open in figure viewerPowerPoint Results of depth-invariant processing for three UAV images.

TABLE 1. Mean Z-scores extracted across the whales in the three images from Figure 3, presenting results from the RGB image and three depth-invariant band pairs. The results from the RGB image are presented as individual red, green, and blue bands. The highest value for each image is shown in bold. Mean Z-scores Image A Image B Image C Red 1.00 0.85 0.40 Green −0.28 0.90 0.07 Blue −0.45 0.54 −0.08 Red/green 2.21 0.67 1.85 Red/blue 2.11 1.05 1.88 Green/blue 0.32 1.64 1.25 Application of Lyzenga's water column correction enhanced the contrast and edge definition between whales and surrounding water in the three UAV-captured images presented here. For whales on or just below the surface, the red/green and red/blue depth-invariant band pairs were the most effective band pair combination for enhancing contrast between the whale and surrounding waters, both visually (Figure 3A and C) and resulting in the highest anomaly values (Table 1). The effectiveness of the red band for animals on or near the surface is consistent with findings from Colefax et al. (2021), who demonstrated the red band produced the greatest spectral contrast for detecting dolphins, sharks, and other marine fauna from a UAV. At increasing depths, the green/blue band pair produced a stronger visual contrast and highest anomaly result (Figure 3B; Table 1) owing to the red waveband becoming attenuated at greater depth. The depth of the target animal(s) will influence the optimal band pairing and subsequent object enhancement within the image. The red band (610–700 nm), and other bands with wavelengths approaching the red end of the spectrum (e.g., red edge and near infrared), will become fully attenuated around 2–3 m depth (Hamylton, 2011; Mishra et al., 2005). Thus, the effectiveness of band pairs using the red band will be substantially reduced at this depth. However, in turbid waters, where sightability below the surface is limited, longer wavelength bands may be optimal for increasing the contrast of animals just below the surface (Colefax et al., 2021). Image enhancement methods for improving whale detection rates even in optically shallow waters (<2–3 m) has important implications for studies reliant on whale visibility, such as estimating abundance (e.g., Hodgson et al., 2017). This is key for research conducted on breeding/resting grounds, with lactating females and their calves spending over 50% of time within 3 m of the surface (Bejder et al., 2019). The methods presented here have the potential to increase the confidence of machine learning and automated detection models. Machine learning techniques for automated detection of whales are increasingly being applied to UAV-collected data sets providing an efficient way to process large amounts of data. Studies using machine learning to detect individual animals or plants rely on the detection of target objects against mostly homogenous backgrounds which typically rely on a clear contrast to reliably discriminate animals from their surrounding environment (Laliberte & Ripple, 2003). The use of machine learning for detecting marine vertebrates is further complicated by coloration similarities between some species and the surrounding water (e.g., blue whales; Gray et al., 2019) and nonuniform backgrounds that are subject to varying environmental conditions. In ecological studies, object-based image analysis (OBIA) is the most commonly used machine learning method (Dujon & Schofield, 2019). It provides versatility for detecting objects in varied backgrounds with confounding features, objects that vary in size and shape, and may be sparsely distributed in the image data set (Chabot et al., 2018), making it ideal for abundance and distribution studies. Importantly, even with increased flexibility over other machine learning methods, OBIA is still reliant on the object(s) of interest in the image being localized from surrounding pixels through a local brightness contrast, either as a relatively brighter or relatively darker group of image pixels (Groom et al., 2013). For whale detection, increasing the anomaly (Z-score) of the whale object, as demonstrated here, could potentially improve OBIA-derived results and increase detection availability. Here we have demonstrated that water column correction techniques can enhance the visual outline and anomaly signal over the body of whales on the surface and submerged at shallow depths. However, we recognize constraints associated with the limited spectral resolution provided when working with three bands (i.e., red, green, and blue) within the visible range (wavelength 400–700 nm). Employing multispectral or hyperspectral sensors and customizing or selecting bands configured to focus on wavelength bands optimal for the spectral characteristics of the water body, such as the coastal band (Fretwell et al., 2014), and target species may further reduce perception bias and subsequently improve animal availability at depth compared to standard RGB sensors (Colefax et al., 2018). Additionally, obtaining a larger image data set is critical for understanding the effectiveness of depth invariant indices derived from possible band pairs, and whether these differ with the whale depth and environmental factors (e.g., turbidity). Ultimately, an understanding of the role of water column attenuation correction is critical for accurate detection of whales and is particularly relevant with the increasing use of low-cost UAV platforms and machine learning techniques for achieving estimates of population abundance and monitoring movement patterns of marine wildlife in shallow coastal habitats.

Earth’s drylands are home to more than two billion people, provide key ecosystem services, and exert a large influence on the trends and variability in Earth’s carbon cycle. However, modeling dryland carbon and water fluxes with remote sensing suffers from unique challenges not typically encountered in mesic systems, particularly in capturing soil moisture stress. Here, we develop and evaluate an approach for joint modeling of dryland gross primary production (GPP), net ecosystem exchange (NEE), and evapotranspiration (ET) in the western United States (U.S.) using a suite of AmeriFlux eddy covariance sites spanning major functional types and aridity regimes. We use artificial neural networks (ANNs) to predict dryland ecosystem fluxes by fusing optical vegetation indices, multitemporal thermal observations, and microwave soil moisture/temperature retrievals from the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) sensor. Our new dryland ANN (DrylANNd) carbon and water flux model explains more than 70 % of monthly variance in GPP and ET, improving upon existing MODIS GPP and ET estimates at most dryland eddy covariance sites. DrylANNd predictions of NEE were considerably worse than its predictions of GPP and ET, likely because soil and plant respiratory processes are largely invisible to satellite sensors. Optical vegetation indices, particularly the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and near-infrared reflectance of vegetation (NIRv), were generally the most important variables contributing to model skill. However, daytime and nighttime land surface temperatures and SMAP soil moisture and soil temperature also contributed to model skill, with SMAP especially improving model predictions of shrubland, grassland, and savanna fluxes and land surface temperatures improving predictions in evergreen needleleaf forests. Our results show that a combination of optical vegetation indices, thermal infrared, and microwave observations can substantially improve estimates of carbon and water fluxes in drylands, potentially providing the means to better monitor vegetation function and ecosystem services in these important regions that are undergoing rapid hydroclimatic change.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-2022-186,"",,
rayyan-220226870,Multi-Label Classification on Remote-Sensing Images,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Acquiring information on large areas on the earth's surface through satellite cameras allows us to see much more than we can see while standing on the ground. This assists us in detecting and monitoring the physical characteristics of an area like land-use patterns, atmospheric conditions, forest cover, and many unlisted aspects. The obtained images not only keep track of continuous natural phenomena but are also crucial in tackling the global challenge of severe deforestation. Among which Amazon basin accounts for the largest share every year. Proper data analysis would help limit detrimental effects on the ecosystem and biodiversity with a sustainable healthy atmosphere. This report aims to label the satellite image chips of the Amazon rainforest with atmospheric and various classes of land cover or land use through different machine learning and superior deep learning models. Evaluation is done based on the F2 metric, while for loss function, we have both sigmoid cross-entropy as well as softmax cross-entropy. Images are fed indirectly to the machine learning classifiers after only features are extracted using pre-trained ImageNet architectures. Whereas for deep learning models, ensembles of fine-tuned ImageNet pre-trained models are used via transfer learning. Our best score was achieved so far with the F2 metric is 0.927.","",https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2201.01971,"",,

To maintain and increase our global food system production, to reduce biodiversity loss and preserve our natural ecosystem, new practices and technologies are required. This book focuses on the latest advances in remote sensing technology and agricultural engineering leading to the sustainable agriculture practices. Earth observation data, in situ and proxy-remote sensing data are the main source of information for monitoring and analyzing agriculture activities. Particular attention is given to earth observation satellites and the Internet of Things for data collection, to multispectral and hyperspectral data analysis using machine learning and deep learning, to WebGIS and the Internet of Things for sharing and publication of the results, among others.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/books978-3-0365-5336-8,"",,
rayyan-220226888,"Mapping Tree Cover Expansion in Montana, U.S.A. Rangelands Using High-Resolution Historical Aerial Imagery",,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract Worldwide, trees are colonizing rangelands with high conservation value. The introduction of trees into grasslands and shrublands causes large-scale changes in ecosystem structure and function, which have cascading impacts to ecosystem services, biodiversity, and agricultural economies. Satellites are increasingly being used to track tree cover at continental to global scales, but these methods can only provide reliable estimates of change over recent decades. Given the slow pace of tree cover expansion, remote sensing techniques that can extend this historical record provide critical insights into the magnitude of environmental change. Here, we estimate conifer expansion in rangelands of the northern Great Plains, United States, North America, using historical aerial imagery from the mid-20th century and modern aerial imagery. We analyzed 19.3 million hectares of rangelands in Montana, USA, using a convolutional neural network (U-Net architecture) and cloud computing to detect tree features and tree cover change. Our bias-corrected results estimate 3.0 ± 0.2 million hectares of conifer tree cover expansion in Montana rangelands, which accounts for 15.4% of the total study area. Overall accuracy was greater than 91%, but producer accuracy was lower than user accuracy (0.60 vs. 0.88). Nonetheless, the omission errors were not spatially correlated, indicating that the method is reliable for estimating the spatial extent of tree cover expansion. Using the model results in conjunction with historical and modern imagery allows for effective communication of the scale of tree expansion while overcoming the recency effect caused by shifting environmental baselines.","",https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.12.28.522142,"",,

However, it is a crucial problem in that deforestation results in serious environmental problems such as global climate change, reduced biodiversity, etc. In order to effectively solve the problems, satellite imagery would be a good alternative to estimate the deforestation of the Amazon. With a combination of optical images and Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images, observation of such a massive area regardless of weather conditions become possible. In this paper, we present an accurate deforestation estimation method with conventional UNet and comprehensive data processing. The diverse channels of Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 are carefully selected and utilized to train deep neural networks. With the proposed method, deforestation status for novel queries are successfully estimated with high accuracy.","",https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2206.10831,"",,
rayyan-220226974,Modelling the impacts of extreme weather events on crop yields using water balance and satellite sensor data,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Managing weather related risks in cropping systems includes strategies to share the risk such as insurance schemes. Advances in satellite sensor technology and interpolated regional weather data enable insights in the relationship between extreme weather events and yields losses which in turn offers possibilities for area-yield insurance schemes.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Extreme weather events &amp;amp;#160;during sensitive phenological stages of the growing season differed significantly (p &amp;lt; 0.05) between low and high crop yields (Gobin, 2012; Gobin, 2018). Spatial return levels confirmed the exceptionality of 2016 and 2018 as extreme wet and dry years with high return periods and yield impacts (Gobin and Van de Vyver, 2021). We investigated the importance of weather data, satellite sensor-derived vegetation indices and water balance simulations in estimating crop yields of winter wheat, potato and sugar beet for the period 2016-2018. The water balance simulations were performed with the Aquacrop model, while the yield simulations were realised with the machine learning technique random forest regression. Results for winter wheat showed that NDVI series did not respond to crop yield affecting weather conditions (Vannoppen and Gobin, 2021). Weather and/or soil water depletion during sensitive phenological stages in combination with the NDVI integral during the growing season explained up to 57 of late potato, 66% of winter wheat, 68% of early potato and 84% of sugar beet yield variability.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Machine learning techniques proved valuable in estimating crop yields thereby elucidating the importance of weather conditions during sensitive crop stages.

rayyan-220226981,From the President and <scp>IFST</scp> News,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Springtime always sees plenty of activity in the IFST calendar. This year the AGM was at the end of March, where we take necessary and important decisions that support the governance of the Institute, but also where we have the opportunity of acknowledging the changes to our Board. We say thanks to those members who are outgoing and have done so much for IFST and also confirm the appointment and welcome those who are incoming. We have four new trustees joining the Board this year including President Elect Sterling Crew. Much of our engagement is now ‘remote/electronic’ procedures, which included, for the first time this year, the President-Elect ballot and, indeed, the AGM itself. It is good to see the numbers of members who can engage in such important processes increasing as a result – good democratic governance in action! It was also very gratifying to see the strength of the field putting themselves forward for President Elect and I hope this is a sign of the ambition many members have for IFST. Whilst online engagement has many benefits, by the time this volume of the Journal is in print, many of us will have met in Birmingham for the SC22 Conference Lunch and Lecture. Our Spring Conference (SC22) is a much-welcomed staple of our calendar. We took the difficult decision many months ago that holding SC22 itself in person was probably still not a viable proposition, but the opportunity to have a face to face ‘companion’ event seemed like a good option. We hope that accommodating the needs of everyone is something we can continue to do, whilst adapting to the changing environment. The theme of this issue is ‘Future Foods’. Whilst IFST has a major role to play in ensuring the safety and so much more, of today's food, the opportunities to ‘invent our future’ is what gets many of our members out of bed in the morning! I think it is safe to say, that there will be something for everyone in this edition. In talking to members, we know that this publication is one of most valued benefits of IFST membership. So, as we head into summer I wonder if we might indulge in a little fun! Where do you like to read your Journal? If you would like to share, why not join me in posting on the community pages: community.ifst.org/ IFST has elected Sterling Crew as its new President-Elect. Sterling's election was formally noted during IFST's Annual General Meeting on 31 March 2022. Of his appointment, Sterling said: ‘It is a great pleasure and privilege to be elected to be the next President of the Institute of Food Science and Technology, especially as the selection was by my professional peers. The IFST is a fantastic organisation with a marvellous membership at its very heart. I pledge to play my part in adding further value to membership and promoting the organisation's worthy charitable aims. This is an exciting time for IFST as we approach our 60th Diamond Jubilee and with chartership potentially on the horizon. Food science and technology has a major part to play in our country's future in these very challenging times. The food sector has responded by developing innovative solutions and creative products. The role our members play has never been more important.’ Sterling Crew Honorary Fellow and FIFST is an experienced food sector director who currently holds a portfolio of positions including Chair of the Food Authenticity Network. Find out more about Sterling here: ifst.org/president-elect22 Sterling will serve as President- Elect for one year before being automatically elected as President and Chair of the Board of Trustees in 2023 for a term of three years. Meet our Board of Trustees here: ifst.org/meet-board IFST has reviewed its Code of Professional Conduct and its accompanying Disciplinary Procedures that apply to all its members. The Code of Professional Conduct – which members are bound by – remains unchanged but IFST's Board approved minor changes to the Disciplinary Procedures to clarify the use of electronic communications, confidentiality requirements and ensure any member against whom a complaint was upheld had adequate time to lodge an appeal. The updated procedures which came into force on 7 April 2022 are available on our website: ifst.org/about-ifst/professional-conduct In March 2022, IFST was invited to attend and exhibit at IFE Manufacturing at ExCeL London. We were given a stand in the ‘Ask the expert’ zone. IFE Manufacturing is a gigantic exhibition, it's an international food and drink event, which brought together ingredients, packaging, processing and food technology companies to showcase their solutions to manufacturers from all over the UK. The event was an opportunity for the food and drink manufacturing industry to discover, learn and source the latest products from the best suppliers in the market. At IFST we're always looking at new ways to expand our membership and provide a benefit to the whole of the food sector, no matter how big or small the business. We went to IFE to meet new food businesses and to introduce IFST to a new audience who may have not heard of us before. IFE provided IFST with a great opportunity to reconnect with current members, meet potential new industry-based members and understand some of the challenges facing the food sector through the thought-provoking presentations and seminars provided throughout the show. The geographical coverage, category span and quality of the exhibitors was impressive and provided interesting (and tasty!) insights into where food products are heading next. Each day, three or four members of the IFST executive team represented IFST at our stand, including Deborah Kendale, Andrew Gardner, Delia Mertoiu, Sarah Drumm, Mariam Zaki, Daiane Cazuza, Patricia Florit and Robin Leaper. Despite being at the back of the expo, we received a good number of visitors who all had interesting questions for us and lots of enquiries about IFST membership and what it comprises. We were also approached by a lot of new product developers and new businesses looking for support for their endeavours. It was interesting to see the breadth of producers and the strong focus on sustainability, using waste products, innovation and current trends in the food sector. We were delighted to meet our current members at the expo, who came over to our stand each day. The geographical coverage, category span and quality of the exhibitors was impressive and provided interesting (and tasty!) insights into where food products are heading next. I was delighted to be invited by IFE Manufacturing to chair one of the NPD sessions titled From kitchen table to factory floor. This took place on the Innovation Platform on the opening day. It was the first of two back to back sessions examining the NPD process and how to get products from the idea and concept stage through to a fully manufactured product. This session focused on the early development process and highlighted some of the common roadblocks and key considerations that need to be addressed during the initial stages of a development project. Andrew Gardner and Patricia Florit at the IFST stand We drew a large audience (including more IFST members), with every seat in the auditorium taken. There were some great questions from the audience – and we kept going even when the set behind us collapsed mid-session! The panel gave some sound advice about how to get started and how to protect your ideas. We discussed how to make sure products are legal and safe, how to find partners for co-manufacturing and signposted the audience to other resources available to help at this early stage of development. It was a great pleasure to chair this session, and to work with such an experienced and knowledgeable panel of IFST Fellows. One of the many great benefits of being a member of IFST is having access to a wide network of food industry experts. Thank you to IFE Manufacturing for inviting me to take part and for a great show. It was great to finally meet people face to face after two years! There was certainly a buzz about the place. Three big trends were very evident throughout the show: vegan, environment and health. Without a doubt vegan products and meat alternatives are starting to move into mainstream, with new products using mainstream flavours and targeting everyday eating occasions. Many of the companies were keen to talk about their environmental credentials. I saw a cereal carton made from agricultural waste rather than wood pulp, that had the same look and feel as carton. There were also a number of businesses advertising that they use no plastic bags for their snack products. From a hero ingredient perspective, I noticed that seaweed is entering the savoury snack market, highlighting its health benefits. Also, there were a lot of dried fruit snacks as alternatives to more traditional snack products. The panel discussion on The National Food Strategy between the Food Foundation, Compass Group, Guy's and St Thomas’ Foundation and Mission Ventures was notable. Apart from reiterating the importance of and need to take action, the panellists shared the fact that Tesco and JS have agreed to report on how much of the food they sell is ‘healthier’ products. If you missed the panel discussion From kitchen table to factory floor, there is a recording available on the IFE website to watch on demand: web ifemanufacturing.co.uk/seminar-programme Join IFST ifst.org/membership Prof Robin May delivering the SC22 lecture On 25 April, at University College Birmingham, Professor Robin May, Chief Scientific Advisor to the Food Standards Agency, pictured above, gave his talk to a group of members, speakers and friends of IFST at our preconference lunch and lecture. He opened by stating that eating is one of the few universal human behaviours and that trust in food is critical and is underpinned by science. However, science is becoming more complicated and harder to explain, and becomes increasingly challenging especially around foods that are not yet on the market, but will be, in the future. For context, May indicated that food shopping is habitual and purchasing takes on average six to nine seconds. Reading a product label fully would take many minutes and therefore messaging on labels is often not the best way to communicate information. The challenge is to combine a high level of science and communication about risk with a digestible, easy to compute output. He commented that the FSA has a very strong science and evidence based position. Good science communication is critical and risk must be communicated effectively for people to understand this. He highlighted the FSA has a very high trust rating of 75% of people trusting the FSA and nine out of 10 consumers in the UK are confident in the safety of the food they eat. This is partly due to a strong emphasis on clear communication, such as the food hygiene rating system, which 87% of the population are aware of and over 50% state they have used within the last year. In terms of behaviours, people underestimate long term risks, such as those around smoking and obesity, and act accordingly. Using percentages to communicate risks is effective but even more effective is the use of real-world frequencies e.g. ‘one-in-20 people’. Translating these into graphics is attractive but the danger is that nuance and detail can be lost with the example of using just green and red traffic light symbols. We need to change the food system to cope with sustainability and health impacts, for the planet and a healthy population. Part of this is the need to advise people on new foods that are coming to market. Prof May stated that his passion is being ready to communicate these necessary changes to the public and the implications they will have on peoples’ diets and food choices. Examples of new foods were insects, lab grown meat, novel crops e.g. chia seeds and, finally, genetically modified (GM) and genetically edited (GE) crops that are being, or will be introduced, to tackle challenges in agriculture, such as drought tolerance and vitamin yield. We need to be able to communicate the benefits of these foods if they are to be accepted by the general public. May also mentioned changes to packaging types and systems. Both these developments are innovations which the public welcome. However, innovators are viewed with greater suspicion, as they are often perceived as being driven by commercial gain. In terms of opinions and behaviours – people state they are driven by ethical choices, such as animal welfare and sustainability, but are, in reality, driven by price, when it comes to choices and shopping habits. To be effective communicators, we need to work with human behaviour and develop a balance between ethical choices and real world drivers that determine food choice behaviours. Attendees at the lecture Day 1 on The Gap in Consumer Understanding began with Jon Alexander's presentation on The Power of Citizenship. He poignantly began with some food for thought that overuse of the word ‘consumer’ is fundamentally flawed. To reshape the way in which we collectively interact as humans, we must focus on the concept of ‘citizens’. Next, Tom Sheldon at the Science Media Centre delivered a selection of case studies. He advocates for businesses to support senior scientists in engaging with the press, believing this connection is the way forward to help the public separate fact from fiction. The day ended with a panel discussion exploring how we can build trust in consumers. Michelle Patel (FSA) remarked that as scientists we need a ‘shift in how we communicate’. The emerging themes were consistency, courage, honesty and humility. Day 2 on The Gap in Skills and Professional Development began with another panel discussion on new and future skills, with Jacinta George succinctly explaining, ‘the skills we'll need in 20 years need to be developed now’. The group discussed key future skills crucial to the food industry including AI, robotics and green skills, as well as soft skills like resilience, flexibility and compassion. Attendees saw Andras Sebok present a Digital Skills case study using an EIT Food competency framework on Campden BRI Hungary. He discussed ‘Industry 4.0’, which refers to a new phase in the industrial revolution focusing on interconnectivity, automation, machine learning and real-time data. Finally, speakers from CAFRE and Linden Foods presented the positive impacts that apprenticeship schemes have had in Northern Ireland. We heard a personal account from Lewis Connelly, a NPD Technologist at Linden Foods, who started a High Level Apprenticeship (HLA) with CAFRE. Day 3 began with an inspiring presentation on early stage NPD with Sarah Gaunt. The concept of ‘front-end innovation’ was introduced and the developmental stages in the early-product pipeline covering ideation, identification, application, selection and incubation were explored. Following this, Lucia Capogna spoke about cyber-security. Examples of food industry cyber-attacks in recent years were presented and Lucia closed with the final thought that ‘no system is 100% secure’, but with the right knowledge 90% of cyber-attacks can be prevented (see p46). Next, Tom Hollands presented the digital sandwich, a technology that digitises food production processes and creates a ‘golden thread’ from farm to fork, tracing ingredients back to the source. Tom used a fictional example of grey ham identified in a shop sandwich to track an ingredient's journey. Missed SC22? As a paid attendee, you have access to our Conference platform, Whova, for three months where you can watch all of the conference sessions and the lecture recording. Starting from mid-June, as a member of IFST, you can watch all the recordings in our IFST Webinar hub via ifst.org/webinars Across the world 90% of people are meat eaters and global consumption of meat is rising. Meat production is already contributing to potentially catastrophic climate change and if nothing changes, future demands will require impossible amounts of land and water. The ‘Meat the Future’ exhibition considered some of the key findings of the LEAP (Livestock, Environment and People) project, which studied the health, environmental, social and economic impacts of meat and dairy production and consumption. The project was a collaboration between the University of Oxford, the Food Policy Research Institute, Sainsbury's and The Nature Conservancy; it was supported by the Wellcome Trust's Our Planet Our Health Programme and ran between 2017 and 2021. The exhibition was targeted at the general public and presented in a very visual, non-judgemental and accessible way. IFST members at the exhibition The Butchers Shop – exploring the public's understanding of the issues surrounding meat production and consumption and its cultural significance The display had trays of meat in between rows of fake grass and joints of meat hanging on hooks. There were also quotes from museum volunteers and visitors who had been asked to complete the sentence: Meat is… … best as beef in a Sunday lunch … delicious and best enjoyed in moderation … too morally fraught to be consumed if other options are available … bad for my health, bad for the planet, bad for the animals. The answers showed a wide spectrum of perspectives. From highlighting how entrenched meat consumption is in our daily lives to signs that the public are beginning to question its environmental, nutritional and ethical credentials. Prompted by this exhibit our group discussed the cultural importance of meat in the diet as another key factor. Changing meat consumption across the world The second window showed a café front – stacks of burgers were used to show how meat consumption had changed in the US, Brazil, UK, China and India between 1961 and 2013. It was a very good, visually impactful way of showing how meat consumption is linked to prosperity and growth. Most notable was the manyfold increase in meat consumption in Brazil (75g per person per day in 1961 to 267g in 2013) and China (10g in 1961 to 69g in 2013) that followed the increase in the population's wealth, with the consumption of meat, culturally representing ‘proof’ of personal wealth. Meat consumption in India has remained the same at 10g, 22 times lower than in the UK, due to religious dietary requirements and a less wealthy population. As for the US, it remains top of the meat consumption chart, at a staggering 243g per person per day in 1961 and 316g in 2013. Living off the land – agricultural practices and how they have changed over the years This exhibit was presented as a set of shelves, with various toys, pictures and items on display. Forty percent of the world's total land area is currently dedicated to agriculture, providing livelihoods to millions. But how did farming develop from a traditional local enterprise to the global industry it is today? And how has science enabled farmers to satisfy the world's increasing appetite for meat? In the Middle Ages people farmed strips of land leased from the Lord of the Manor. By rotating the crops, they kept the soil fertile and grazed animals on the areas left fallow. During the 20th Century, farmers used scientific breeding methods to improve their livestock. There are 34 native cattle breeds in the UK, each selectively bred to thrive in different conditions and produce milk, beef or both. Today 14 of the cattle breeds are classed as rare. During WW2, Britain was forced to produce more food when imports nearly stopped, but this came at a heavy cost to biodiversity as woods were cut down and ancient grasslands dug up to plant crops. High stakes – explaining the environmental impact of meat production Farmers now raise more animals than ever to slaughter for meat. Vast areas of forest are cleared for grazing, releasing carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, causing widespread biodiversity loss and changing ecosystems irreversibly. Crops grown for animal feed require more land, fertiliser and irrigation – competing for water and other resources needed for human food. As ruminant animals digest food they release methane which is significantly more damaging to the environment than CO2, contributing to climate change. The IFST group noted that there was no mention of the ethics or legislation of meat production, animal welfare or animal husbandry in the exhibition. As scientists we were interested to understand more about current research into methane reduction. New eco labelling for food – providing consumers with information on the true environmental impact of their food choices ‘There is a strong public desire for free choice in what we eat, but in reality, our diet is already shaped by what businesses offer us to buy and how it is labelled and marketed.’ Dr Tara Garnett, LEAP project scientist. Based on the familiar Nutriscore nutrition labels (five levels of impact), the ecolabels being trialled rate food products according to their positive or negative impact on water scarcity, water pollution, greenhouse gas emissions and biodiversity. As well as giving consumers more choice, researchers hope that food producers will respond by developing new products with lower environmental impact. Tests to find the most effective design have been underway. Beef burgers have much higher environmental impacts of all kinds compared to poultry and plant-based burgers. Most plant-based products emit as much as 10-50 times less CO2 than most animal products. There is a strong public desire for free choice in what we eat, but in reality, our diet is already shaped by what businesses offer us to buy and how it is labelled and marketed. Sowing seeds of a new diet – debugging some of the myths around meat consumption and nutrition A diet including meat has been the norm for human beings across the world for hundreds of thousands of years. Genetic evidence shows some populations adapted to eating farmed dairy products 5,000 years ago. Our bodies rely on animal products such as meat, eggs or dairy for supplies of vitamin B12 that we require for survival. We have also evolved to absorb iron much more easily from meat than from plants. But are there any health risks involved in a meat-heavy diet? And if we reduce our meat-eating, or cut it out altogether, what are the best strategies to get all the vital nutrients we need? Planetary health diet – what would an environmentally friendly diet look like? Our planet has plenty of capacity to feed all of the 8bn people alive today. If we make sensible decisions in the coming year, it can even feed the population of 9-10bn predicted in 2050. But the demand for meat is already pushing the environment to its limits. In the UK, we eat 223g of meat per person per day (2013 figures). This is more than twice the global average. So how much meat can the planet sustainably produce? The EAT-Lancet Commission on Food, Planet and Health tried to answer this and came up with an estimate of 43g per person each day, divided between red meat and poultry – similar to the amount we ate before industrialisation and factory farming. Other approaches have come up with different numbers, but all agree on less meat than we eat today in the UK. A number of studies including the EAT-Lancet planetary health report have recommended eating more than double our current amount of plant-based foods and less than half the amount of sugars and red meat. This report proposes that if we all did this, we could feed our growing population, live healthier, longer lives and reduce our impact on the environment. Meat tomorrow – how science and technology can help us follow a planet friendly diet Our bodies evolved to eat meat and benefit from the nutrients it provides. Now, our diets can evolve to give us the nutrition we need without adding to the climate crisis. Science and technology built the meat industry we thought we needed. But today, research is helping us see why and how we need to do things differently. In the UK, a quarter of evening meals are already vegan or vegetarian. So can more of us learn to love a less meaty menu? Future approaches to a more flexitarian diet proposed in the exhibition included increasing consumption of plant-based protein, insects and cultured meat. Biting the bullet – final thoughts A planet-friendly cafeteria counter Landuse: We would need 8% less agricultural land, largely because we would need less grain to feed livestock. This freed up land could be used to grow nutritious crops for humans or returned to forest to store more carbon and increase biodiversity. Water use quality and fertilisers: Agriculture would need 11% less water, allowing more to be used to maintain wetland, rivers and other biodiversity-rich freshwater habitats. We would use up to 24% less nitrogen and 18% less phosphorous in fertiliser applications so less would run off the land to damage drinking water quality and pollute our rivers, lakes and oceans. Emissions: We could more than halve (55%) the greenhouse gas emissions from the food system – about a 10% reduction in all emissions from human activity. Biodiversity: We could see up to 40% less species extinction, due to less land converted to agriculture and less pollution. Health: The number of premature deaths due to diet-related diseases, such as heart disease and some cancers could decrease by 20%; this is due to the benefits of a healthy diet leading to a healthy weight, the positive effects of high-fibre diets as well as reductions in the incidence of diabetes and some vascular diseases and some cancers.

To be recognised by colleagues, people I hold as mentors and akin to a second family, is really wonderful. I thank the IFST for this Fellowship and will carry this honour with pride. Food science is more than a single discipline, encompassing pure science, technology, nutrition, sustainability and food security. I maintain that any subject can be taught using food as the focus, and that food teaching should draw on food science in its broadest terms. No one can live without food, so its future has to be nurtured through inspirational teaching and communication at all levels by all of us in the profession, supporting IFST.’ This year marks the tenth anniversary of the UK Ecotrophelia competition. Our Dragons’ Den-style competition has seen many participants showing products that would later be sold in supermarkets by different companies showing the great initiative and ability of those participating to envisage the future of the food market. By the time this issue has been published, the finalists will have pitched their products to the ‘Dragons’ on 7 June, and the winner will be announced at the evening event held at Tesco Heart Building, where participants will be able to enjoy some socialising and meet other industry professionals and Ecotrophelia sponsors from across the industry including PepsiCo, Unilever, Mondelez, Coca Cola, Warburtons, Sainsbury's, Marks and Spencer, Food Manufacture, Institute of Food Science and Technology and Campden BRI.

Most countries in this region attempt to return the forested areas through reforestation. However, planting trees efficiently is difficult because changing environmental conditions and tree size could affect the water consumption of different tree-species under climate change. Hence, the information regarding water use characteristics of different tree-species in different tree size classes is important to the selection of tree species for reforestation. Nonetheless, available information on species-specific water-use characteristics is less investigated, especially in secondary tropical forests. To gain the information on species-specific water-use characteristics in secondary forests, we estimated tree water use (T) of dominant tree species including Syzygium antisepticum and Adinandra integerrima, hereafter Sa and Ai, respectively, in a secondary tropical forest at Khao Yai National Park Thailand using sap flow data from custom-made thermal dissipation probes and compare T of both species in different tree size classes. Specifically, we evaluated the responses of T of both species in large and small sizes to environmental factors including soil moisture and vapor pressure deficit (VPD) which represent soil and atmospheric humidity, respectively. Results of different soil moisture conditions in both sizes showed consistently higher T in Sa compared to Ai at across VPD ranges. Our results imply that Ai may be suitable for reforestation in the area where droughts frequently occur in the downstream ecosystem through its conservative water-use behavior and may benefit downstream ecosystems with increasing runoff from the forest during drought. Moreover, Ai has conservative water-use behavior regardless of tree size. Thus, Ai would still provide these benefits to ecosystems when they grow larger in the future. In contrast, Sa seems suitable for reforestation in the area with frequent floods because it has high water consumption during high water availability which may slow down runoff from forest into downstream ecosystems when storms come. However, mixed planting species seem to be suitable for reforestation in the area that extreme events do not frequently occur because both species can maintain their water use at moderate soil moisture regardless of tree size which prevent the depletion of soil water availability. This study highlights that the response of T depends on species and tree size. Such information would benefit the selection of tree species for reforestation that could adapt well to certain environments and support policy design on the management of tropical forests and natural resources. Depending on reforestation purpose, Sa and Ai may provide either benefits or negative effects to the ecosystems.","",https://doi.org/10.58837/chula.the.2022.189,"",,
rayyan-220227046,EVALUATING THE SEPARABILITY BETWEEN DRY TROPICAL FORESTS AND SAVANNA WOODLANDS IN THE BRAZILIAN SAVANNA USING LANDSAT DENSE IMAGE TIME SERIES AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract. The Brazilian Savanna is the second largest biogeographical region in Brazil and present different vegetation types, consisting mostly of tropical savannas, grasslands, and forests. The forest types have different tree cover and floristic composition, which is associated to leaf deciduousness. Considering the importance of Cerrado to biodiversity conservation and the maintaining of environmental services, the development of methods to map the different forest types in Cerrado is important for conservation programmes, subsidize restauration plains, and to allow estimations of carbon sink and stock. Mapping heterogeneous tropical areas, such as the Brazilian Savanna, is very complex due to the natural factors and peculiarities of the vegetation types, and it's still particularly challenging to separate between different forest formations. In this study we tested machine learning approaches based on the use of dense image time series, in order to evaluate the separability Dry Tropical Forests and Savanna woodlands. We considered the Brazilian State of Tocantins as the study area, which is located in the Northern region of the country. RF classification of Landsat dense time series showed an overall accuracy of 0.85005, while the LSTM approach presented an overall accuracy of 0.88601, with the highest f1-score for the savanna woodlands class, suggesting the capability of the recurrent neural networks on handling complex long-term dependencies such as the EVI dense time series data. This study showed the potential for the development of a semi-automatic method for discriminating the different types of forest formations in the Brazilian Savanna, based on remote sensing.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/isprs-archives-xliii-b3-2022-841-2022,"",,
rayyan-220227095,Hybrid Modeling of Evapotranspiration: Inferring Stomatal and Aerodynamic Resistances Using Combined Physics-Based and Machine Learning,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"The process of evapotranspiration transfers water vapour from vegetation and soil surfaces to the atmosphere, the so-called latent heat flux (𝑄 LE), and thus crucially modulates Earth’s energy, water, and carbon cycles. Vegetation controls 𝑄 LE through regulating the leaf stomata (i.e., surface resistance 𝑟 s) and through altering surface roughness (aerodynamic resistance 𝑟 a). Estimating 𝑟 s and 𝑟 a across different vegetation types proves to be a key challenge in predicting 𝑄 LE. Here, we propose a hybrid modeling approach (i.e., combining mechanistic modeling and machine learning) for 𝑄 LE where neural networks independently learn the resistances from observations as intermediate variables. In our hybrid modeling setup, we make use of the Penman-Monteith equation based on the Big Leaf theory in conjunction with multi-year flux measurements across different forest and grassland sites from the FLUXNET database. We follow two conceptually different strategies to constrain the hybrid model to control for equifinality arising when estimating the two resistances simultaneously. One strategy is to impose an a priori constraint on 𝑟 a based on our mechanistic understanding (theory-driven strategy), while the other strategy makes use of more observational data and adds a constraint in predicting 𝑟 a through multi-task learning of the latent as well as the sensible heat flux (𝑄 H ; data-driven strategy). Our results show that all hybrid models exhibit a fairly high predictive skill for the target variables with 𝑅 2 = 0.82-0.89 for grasslands and 𝑅 2 = 0.70-0.80 for forests sites at the mean diurnal scale. The predictions of 𝑟 s and 𝑟 a show physical consistency across the two regularized hybrid models, but are physically implausible in the under-constrained hybrid model. The hybrid models are robust in reproducing consistent results for energy fluxes and resistances across different scales (diurnal, seasonal, interannual), reflecting their ability to learn the physical dependence of the target variables on the meteorological inputs. As a next step, we propose to test these heavily observation-informed parameterizations derived through hybrid modeling as a substitute for overly simple ad hoc formulations in Earth system models.","",https://doi.org/10.1002/essoar.10512258.2,"",,

The presence of larger trees was associated with lower overall medication sales, suggesting these trees “are more beneficial with respect to heart disease and mental health than smaller trees,” says co–first author Dengkai Chi, a PhD candidate in bioscience engineering at KU Leuven.Prior studies relating urban greenspace to health have generally relied on two-dimensional (2D) remote sensing, which depicts tree canopy cover but not the features of individual trees, such as the size of their crowns (the leaf-sprouting branches).6,7 That reliance limited the ability of those studies to characterize human exposures to trees.The authors of the new study used airborne LiDAR to distinguish trees from grass, shrubs, and other vegetation, and to characterize both canopy size and density of trees. Images, left to right: © GrB/stock.adobe.com; © Brian Scantlebury/stock.adobe.com.To improve upon the exposure assessment, Chi et al. used 3D remote sensing data generated by airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) systems.5 LiDAR reliably distinguishes trees from other types of vegetation,8 and Chi’s team used it to measure arboreal traits, such as the number of trees per hectare (also known as stem density), tree height, and crown volume. The researchers focused on 604 census tracts in Brussels and surrounding areas. Tracts had an average of 11,616 inhabitants per hectare.Medication sales data for the census tracts were obtained from the Belgian social security agency, which manages health insurance reimbursements for most of the country’s population. The team limited its analysis to medications purchased by adults who were 19–64 years of age between 2006 and 2014.The team then modeled relationships between medication sales and tree traits in single- and two-factor models. They used single-factor models to evaluate the relationship between medication sales and individual tree traits—namely, stem density or crown volume. Using two-factor models, the team evaluated how sales varied in relation to tree density, crown volume, and other traits collectively.After adjusting for socioeconomic status (which also is associated with sales of drugs for heart disease9 and mood disorders10), the researchers observed a curious result. The single-factor models showed that each unit increase in stem density and crown volume corresponded to lower medication sales. However, the two-factor model that included both stem density and crown volume showed that medication sales were, again, lower in areas with greater crown volumes but higher with greater stem densities.What might explain the discrepancy? According to Chi, the results demonstrate that large trees are associated with greater health benefits than even dense stands of smaller trees. “Large trees are more effective at reducing environmental stressors like urban heat, air pollution, and noise than smaller trees,” she says. “That makes them very important for health in urban areas.”Matilda van den Bosch, a physician with a doctorate in landscape planning currently working at the Barcelona Institute for Global Health, says medication sales are a valid proxy for disease prevalence in the population. “This is an important paper that makes the case for preserving large trees in cities,” says van den Bosch, who was not involved in the study. “Humans evolved in the natural environment, and we know that exposure to nature can activate the parasympathetic nervous system in ways that facilitate recovery from stress.”11–14Cecil Konijnendijk, a professor of urban forestry at the University of British Columbia and visiting professor at KU Leuven, agrees. “We need to be more tree-inclusive in terms of how we design and manage our cities,” says Konijnendijk, who also was not involved in the study. “People talk about large-scale planting, but we need to start by protecting what we have. This paper helps to provides the evidence for why we should do this.”Konijnendijk and van den Bosch both say there is a need to replicate the current findings with additional research using individual-level data. In future studies, Chi says she will use airborne LiDAR and hyperspectral images to quantify other arboreal traits, such as tree species diversity, in relation to human health. “We want to really explore the potential of using this kind of 3D high-resolution sensing data in our research,” she says.Raf Aerts, co–first author of the study, adds, “Ideally, we would also like to move from aggregated census-tract level data to longitudinal individual health and exposure data. A national, European, or global tree exposure cohort would be ideal to study health effects of trees in more detail.”What do such findings mean for people who live in places where green things cannot grow? Despite a dearth of relevant research in arid or polar regions, there is evidence that greenspaces introduced into such areas may have positive effects.15,16 “Several cultures have indeed adapted to nongreen habitats,” says Aerts. “However, from an evolutionary point of view, humans are a species of tropical and subtropical forest and savanna habitats. So there is an intrinsic link between humans and greenspace.”Charles W.

rayyan-220227152,Comparing global Sentinel-2 land cover maps for regional species distribution modelling,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Mapping the spatial and temporal dynamics of species distributions is necessary for biodiversity conservation land-use planning decisions. Recent advances in remote sensing and machine learning have allowed for high resolution species distribution modelling that can inform landscape-level decision making. Here we compare the performance of three popular Sentinel-2 (10m) land cover maps including Dynamic World (DW), European land cover (ELC10) and World Cover (WC), in predicting wild bee species richness over southern Norway. The proportion of grassland habitat within 250m (derived from the land cover maps), along with temperature and distance to sandy soils, were used as predictors in both Bayesian Regularized Neural Network and Random Forest models. Models using grassland habitat from DW performed best (RMSE = 2.85; averaged across models), followed by WC (RMSE = 2.86) and ELC10 (RMSE = 2.89). All satellite-derived maps outperformed a manually mapped Norwegian land cover dataset called AR5 (RMSE = 3.02). When validating the model predictions of bee species richness against citizen science data on solitary bee occurrences using generalized linear models, we found that ELC10 performed best (AIC = 2800), followed by WC (AIC = 2939), and DW (AIC = 2973). While the differences in RMSE we observed between models were small, they may be significant when such models are used to prioritize grassland patches within a landscape for conservation subsidies or management policies. Partial dependencies in our models showed that increasing the proportion of grassland habitat is positively associated with wild bee species richness, thereby justifying bee conservation schemes that aim to enhance semi-natural grassland habitat. Our results confirm the utility of satellite-derived land cover maps in supporting high resolution species distribution modelling and suggest there is scope to monitor changes in species distributions over time given the dense time series provided by products like DW.","",https://doi.org/10.22541/au.166870026.66567319/v1,"",,
rayyan-220227168,ReUse: REgressive Unet for Carbon Storage and above Ground Biomass Estimation,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) has recently established the Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD+) program that requires countries to report their carbon emissions and sink estimates through national greenhouse gas inventories (NGHGI). Thus, developing automatic systems capable of estimating the carbon absorbed by forests without in-situ observation becomes essential. To support this important need, in this work we introduce ReUse, a simple but effective deep-learning approach to estimate the carbon absorbed by forest areas based on remote sensing. The novelty of the proposed method is in the use of the public above-ground biomass (AGB) data from the European Space Agency's Climate Change Initiative Biomass project as ground truth to estimate the carbon sequestration capacity of any portion of land on Earth using Sentinel-2 images and a pixel-wise Regressive UNet. The approach has been compared to two literature proposals, using a private dataset and human-engineered features. The results show a greater generalization ability of the proposed approach, with a decrease in Mean Absolute Error and Root Mean Squared Error, respectively, of 16.9 and 14.3 in the area of Vietnam and 4.7 and 5.1 in the area of Myanmar over the runner-up. Finally, as a case study, we reported an analysis made for the Astroni area, a nature reserve located near the metropolitan area of Naples in southern Italy, struck by a large fire, producing predictions consistent with values found by experts in the field. These results further support the use of such an approach for the early detection of AGB variations, both in urban and rural areas.","",https://doi.org/10.20944/preprints202212.0158.v1,"",,
rayyan-220227211,Mapping terrestrial evaporation regimes : a data-driven analysis of land-atmosphere interactions under climate change,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Terrestrial ecosystems are essential for human life, as they provide several key services, such as food and water security, sequestration of anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) and evaporative cooling. Healthy ecosystems perform photosynthesis, during which the plants’ stomata, tiny apertures on the leaf surface, are open to take up CO2 and evaporate water into the atmosphere, thereby providing a cooling effect. At the Earth’s surface, all the energy that is available from solar radiation that is not used to evaporate water, is used to heat near-surface air. Thereby, ecosystems play a key role in connecting the energy and the water balance.In Chapter 1, I introduce the energy and the water balance, which are linked through the evaporation of terrestrial water by ecosystems. How much of the available energy is used to evaporate water from the land surface, the evaporative fraction (EF), depends on water supply (soil moisture); When the soil is too dry for plants to extract water from the soil, plants close their stomata to prevent water loss. As the soil moistens, plants can access this water and increase their transpiration with further soil moisture increases until the maximum EF is reached. At this point, any additional soil moisture increases will no longer affect the EF, rendering the magnitude of the evaporation of water, the terrestrial evaporation (ET), solely dependent on available energy. The soil moisture and the corresponding terrestrial evaporation regime can dampen or amplify heat waves and other extreme events. Therefore, distinguishing energy versus water-limited conditions and accurately representing in Earth system models is essential.The aim of this thesis is to study the relevance of water versus energy limited conditions and associated regime transitions for weather, climate and related extremes under climate change. In this data-driven analysis, a multitude of data streams is used, amongst which satellite observations, in-situ observations, such as weather balloons, gridded machine-learning based data sets and heavily constrained and unconstrained model output from Earth system models. Using such a combination of data products provides a comprehensive perspective that allows to infer the role of limitations in individual data products by comparing results between them.In addition to research focusing solely on either energy or water, I introduce a novel index in Chapter 2 that considers the relevance of both water and energy availability for terrestrial evaporation. Using satellite observations over Europe, energy limitation is found in Northern Europe and water limitation in the Mediterranean, separated by a transitional zone across Central Europe. A soil moisture threshold, the critical soil moisture (CSM), which separates energy and water-limited conditions, is determined at the continental and the grid cell scale. This transition matters, as it separates water-limited conditions, where soil moisture can impact the near-surface temperature through evaporation, from energy-limited conditions, where atmospheric dynamics and related temperature and solar radiation impact the evaporation of water. The CSM is sensitive to local climate, soil and vegetation characteristics, but is robust when determined using proxies from other data products for energy availability and terrestrial evaporation.As land-atmosphere interactions work both ways, land surface conditions can also be inferred from an atmosphere perspective: In Chapter 3, atmospheric temperature and humidity measurements from weather balloons are translated into landscape-scale surface fluxes using a mixed-layer model. Juxtaposing these surface fluxes against satellite-observed surface soil moisture, the CSM is estimated, which is then used to separate water versus energy-limited conditions. Further, I find that afternoon atmospheric boundary layers (ABLs) are warmer, drier and deeper over water-limited as compared to energy-limited surfaces.In Chapter 4, future trends ecosystem water limitation trends are studied with model output from a suite of state-of-the-art Earth system models, which (i) can complement data lacking from observations (e.g. root-zone soil moisture) and (ii) allows to infer future climate conditions. Ecosystem Limitation Index (ELI) trends based on historical simulations and future projections reveal a widespread increase in ecosystem water limitation under climate change. Although globally this is driven mostly by increasing energy availability, several hot spot regions are identified where ecosystem water limitation increases particularly rapid owing to simultaneous decreases in water availability. This shift towards ecosystem water limitation occurs in space, as transitional zones shift northwards in Canada and northern Eurasia and northeastwards in the Amazon, and in time through widespread lengthening of the water-limited season. Although net surface radiation is the most dominant driver for ELI trends, a full range of eco-climate variables is needed to understand local differences.In previous chapters, I mainly focused on mean climate conditions, whereas the role of land- atmosphere interactions for climate extremes is even more pronounced: In Chapter 5, I find that in about half of the land area with active vegetation, vegetation productivity extremes jointly occur with hydrometeorological hazards. The drivers of such vegetation extremes vary in space: In the Northern Hemisphere, temperature-related hazards are found important above 50°N, whereas water-related hazards most strongly impact vegetation productivity below 50°N. Further, several key regions are identified where vegetation productivity maxima are energy- driven and minima are governed by water, which is characteristic for transitional regimes and strong land-atmosphere coupling.In Chapter 6, an ensemble of Earth system models is used to find that in 77% of the vegetated land surface, maximum temperature is increasing more rapidly than mean temperatures under climate change. In several hot spot regions, such temperature divergence increases occur alongside shifts towards ecosystem water limitation and related reductions in evaporative cooling. Whereas the magnitude of temperature divergence trends is largest in initially energy-limited and transitional regions, where ELI trends are strongest, the sensitivity is highest in initially water- limited regions, where evaporative cooling is most strongly affected by increasing ecosystem water limitation.In Chapter 7, specific contributions, limitations and future research opportunities are synthesized. In conclusion, a novel index was introduced that jointly considers the relevance of energy and water availability for terrestrial evaporation. Typically, water-limited conditions are characterized by dry soils and correspondingly low terrestrial evaporation and high sensible heating of near- surface air. As such, ABLs are warmer and drier over water versus energy limitation, thereby amplifying heat extremes. Hot spot regions are found where heat extremes are amplified by reductions in evaporative cooling. Identifying such regions is essential to tailor adaptation strategies, such as irrigation or tillage practices, city greening and afforestation, to mitigate impact on human health and infrastructure. Further, these studies allow the comparison of modelled and observed land-atmosphere coupling, which could inform model development and lead to better weather and climate forecasts and accurate determination of land-atmosphere coupling hot spots and associated extreme events.","",https://doi.org/10.18174/569775,"",,
rayyan-220227241,The Future Change in Evaporation Based on the CMIP6 Merged Data Generated by Deep-Learning Method in China,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Land evaporation (LET) is an important variable in climate change, water cycle and water resources management. Mastering the projected changes in LET is significant for crop water requirements and the energy cycle. The global climate model (GCM) is a vital tool for future climate change research. However, the GCMs have low spatial resolution and relatively high errors. We use a deep learning (DL)-based model to deal with this problem. The DL approach can downscale the model data and merge simultaneously. We applied the DL approach to a suit of models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 6th edition (CMIP6) LET data. From the result of all the evaluation metrics, the DL merged data greatly improved in both spatial and time dimensions. The mean RMSE is 5.85 mm and the correlation is 0.95 between the DL merged data and reference data (historical reliable evaporation data). The future LET evidently increases in four scenarios (SSP1–2.6, SSP2–4.5, SSP3–7.0, and SSP5–8.5), and the upward intensity rises from the low to high emission scenarios. The highest increasing regions are in the Tibet Plateau and the south of China and the trend is larger than 10 mm/decade in the high scenarios. From the seasonal point of view, the increasing trend in spring and summer is far larger than for autumn and winter. The Tibet Plateau and the northeast of China have the largest upward trend in the spring of SSP5–8.5, higher than 1.6 mm/decade.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/w14182800,"",,
rayyan-220227247,Advancing terrestrial biodiversity monitoring with satellite remote sensing in the context of the Kunming-Montreal global biodiversity framework,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract Satellite remote sensing (SRS) provides huge potential for tracking progress towards conservation targets and goals, but SRS products need to be tailored towards the requirements of ecological users and policymakers. In this viewpoint article, we propose to advance SRS products with a terrestrial biodiversity focus for tracking the goals and targets of the Kunming-Montreal global biodiversity framework (GBF). Of 371 GBF biodiversity indicators, we identified 58 unique indicators for tracking the state of terrestrial biodiversity, spanning 2 goals and 8 targets. Thirty-six shared enough information to analyse their underlying workflows and spatial information products. We used the concept of Essential Biodiversity Variables (EBV) to connect spatial information products to different dimensions of biodiversity (e.g. species populations, species traits, and ecosystem structure), and then counted EBV usage across GBF goals and targets. Combined with published scores on feasibility, accuracy, and immaturity of SRS products, we identified a priority list of terrestrial SRS products representing opportunities for scientific development in the next decade. From this list, we suggest two key directions for advancing SRS products and workflows in the GBF context using current instruments and technologies. First, existing terrestrial ecosystem distributions and live cover fraction SRS products (of above-ground biomass, ecosystem fragmentation, ecosystem structural variance, fraction of vegetation cover, plant area index profile, and land cover) need to be refined using a co-design approach to achieve harmonized ecosystem taxonomies, reference states and improved thematic detail. Second, new SRS products related to plant physiology and primary productivity (e.g. leaf area index, chlorophyll content &amp; flux, foliar N/P/K content, and carbon cycle) need to be developed to better estimate plant functional traits, especially with deep learning techniques, radiative transfer models and multi-sensor frameworks. Advancements along these two routes could greatly improve the tracking of GBF target 2 (‘improve connectivity of priority terrestrial ecosystems), target 3 (‘ensure management of protected areas’), target 6 (‘control the introduction and impact of invasive alien species’), target 8 (‘minimize impact of climate change on biodiversity’), target 10 (‘increase sustainable productivity of agricultural and forested ecosystems’) and target 12 (‘increase public urban green/blue spaces’). Such improvements can have secondary benefits for other EBVs, e.g. as predictor variables for modelling species distributions and population abundances (i.e. data that are required in several GBF indicators). We hope that our viewpoint stimulates the advancement of biodiversity monitoring from space and a stronger collaboration among ecologists, SRS scientists and policy experts.","",https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.04.25.489356,"",,
rayyan-220227305,On multiple drivers predicting ecosystem functioning in a tropical forest,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Understand the relative contribution of different factors that can determine the structure and diversity of forest communities along environmental gradients and secondary succession time has been a relevant theme in contemporary ecology. Recently the impact of these environmental factors (e.g., soils, topography, and climate) on biodiversity-ecosystem function relationship has gained importance in understanding tropical forests. Topographic and edaphic gradients together with climate can influence the distribution of functional traits, and consequently, ecosystem functioning. The study of the secondary succession of tropical forests with an approach based on the relation of functional traits and environmental factors has allowed elucidating emerging patterns of the ecosystem processes, mainly of the production and storage of biomass. Thus, the community weighted mean (CWM) are the diversity metrics to test effects on aboveground biomass. This research will assess how abiotic factors and biotic factors affect the assembly of tree communities and the ecosystem functioning of the forest Atlantic in southeastern Brazil. For this, we will analyze how species richness, composition and dominance can change through edaphic-topographic-climatic gradients and time of succession in permanent plots. For this, the following hypotheses will be tested: (1) The edaphic-topographic factors and the time of succession affect the richness, composition and dominance of the species in terms of their contribution to an ecosystem process (2) the variability climate over time of succession has implications for the classification of leaf phenology groups of tree communities. Finally, (3) we propose that AGB increases with time of succession, but changes depending on environmental variability (soil and topography), and that the variation in biomass can be explained by the functional traits of the species through functional dominance (CWM) in secondary forest communities. To answer these questions, we selected three areas with different topographic conditions located in a fragment in the secondary regeneration stage in Viçosa, MG, Brazil. Each area has permanent plots of 1 ha covering a topographic gradient from the valleys to the plateau. Each permanent plot has 100 subplots of 10m x 10m. Totaling two hectares of forest and 200 subplots. In each subplot, all individuals of the living arboreal species with stem circumference showed a height of 10 cm or greater and a height of 130 cm. For each subplot, three topographic variables (elevation, slope and convexity) were measured and calculated using a total station with the aid of an engineer and surface soil samples with a depth of 0 to 10 cm to determine physical and chemical parameters. The aboveground biomass was calculated for each tree individual sampled in the subplots by an allometric equation. We selected different types of functional traits such as leaf phenology, wood density and tree diameter. Multivariate regression analyzes were performed to classify habitat types according to topographic variables and species composition. In addition, we constructed a series of models to explain the effect of potential predictor variables on the response of species richness, species composition, and ecosystem functioning. We also used machine learning to classify leaf phenology groups under the effect of environmental variables. Our study demonstrated that topographic variability, mainly elevation and convexity, determine soil fertility. These results advance our understanding that context-dependent conditions based on topography and soil properties have a high variability at a fine-scale. Furthermore, we found that different topographic conditions and successional timing affect community composition, richness, abundance and proportion of carbon-dominant species over time. We found that different topographic conditions and stand age change community composition, richness, abundance, and carbon dominant species along the late-secondary stage. This study advances our understanding of the mechanisms that drive carbon stock in tropical forests and supports the ‘mass ratio’ hypothesis. We observe that evergreen species show higher richness; meanwhile the deciduous species has a greater contribution to aboveground carbon stock. Thus, the leaf phenology groups can affect the relationships between species richness and aboveground carbon stock. For example, deciduous species are key to maintaining higher carbon stock with smaller numbers of species; meanwhile evergreen species are important to maintain a higher species richness. Thus, we presumed that the leaf phenology group's distribution could be responsible for the cobenefits (positive aboveground carbon stock and species richness relationship) in tropical forests. Using random forest, it was observed that the most influential predictor in the classification of functional groups was topography and soil properties. We emphasize that the information generated in this research can be important for the planning of forest restoration activities (passive and active) based on the high variability of environmental variables on a local scale. We also emphasize the relevance of the functional traits approach to understanding the functioning, conservation and management of tropical forests. Keywords: Biotic and abiotic factors. Cobenefits.

Environ. Sci. Proc. 2022, 17(1), 109; https://doi.org/10.3390/environsciproc2022017109 Published: 30 August 2022 (This article belongs to the Proceedings of The Third International Conference on Fire Behavior and Risk) Download Download PDF Download XML Download Epub Versions Notes In recent years, the EU has implemented several firefighting-related policies to battle and reduce the negative impacts of wildfires. However, the changing environment constantly surprises us with extreme events that cause massive losses for the entire Europe, with the Mediterranean region increasing its vulnerability to these risks. Recently, the wildfire season for the region was observed to have lengthened, and along with the rapid change in fire-weather factors, resulted to extreme wildfire events. As of 2022, total burned area for the EU is recorded to be approx. 792,902 (66% forest) (EFFIS Damage Assessment, 2022). It has long been recognized that the Mediterranean cultural landscape is fire-prone, hence decision-makers see to it that responses and solutions are devoted at mitigating and reducing fire risk. With the advocacy of a paradigm shift to coexist with fire, anticipation of fire incidents is the best approach partnered with comprehensive management. Various studies on wildfires provide geospatial insights and models to foresee fire occurrence, burning extent, success in initial attack, ignition probability, etc. This study aims to recognize and understand wildfire activity by forecasting the occurrence of extreme wildfire events in the near future. The approach is based on coupling ignition and escape models to climate (C3S) and landcover-change (SEDAC) projections to outline the spatial distribution of wildfires up to 2100. We calibrated a series of binary regression models upon historical records of wildfire ignition in Catalonia (Northeast of Spain) using machine-learning techniques under different land cover change and climate scenarios. Disaster risk reduction will be improved through this prediction by identifying wildfire management zones and prioritization of areas.

However, the current review articles on LUCD tend to be limited in scope, rendering a comprehensive review challenging due to the vast number of publications. This paper systematically reviewed 3512 articles retrieved from the Web of Science Core database between 1985 and 2022, utilizing a combination of bibliometric analysis and machine learning methods with LUCD as the main focus. The results indicated an exponential increase in the number of LUCD studies, indicating continued growth in this research field. Commonly used methods include classification-based, threshold-based, model-based, and deep learning-based change detection, with research themes encompassing forest logging and vegetation succession, urban landscape dynamics, and biodiversity conservation and management. To build an intelligent change detection system, researchers need to develop a flexible framework that integrates data preprocessing, feature extraction, land use type interpretation, and accuracy evaluation, given the continuous evolution and application of remote sensing data, deep learning, big data, and artificial intelligence.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/land12051050,"",,

This study explored the land use changes in the Sal Forest area from 1991 to 2020, with the prediction of 2030 and 2040. This study examined and analyzed the changes in five land use classes viz., waterbodies, settlement, Sal Forest, other vegetation, and bare land, and predict those classes using Cellular Automated Artificial Neural Network (CA-ANN) model. The Sankey diagram was employed to represent the change percentage of Land Use and Land Cover (LULC). The LULC for 1991, 2000, 2010, and 2020 derived from Landsat TM and Landsat OLI images, were used to predict the periods of 2030 and 2040. During the last 30 years, the Sal Forest area decreased by 23.35%, whereas the settlement and bare land area increased by 107.19% and 160.89%. The greatest loss of the Sal Forest was observed from 1991 to 2000 by 46.20%. At the same period of time the settlements were increased by 92.68% indicating the encroachment of settlement in the Sal Forest area. The Sankey diagram revealed a major conversion was found between other vegetation and the Sal Forest area. There was a vis-à-vis between other vegetation and the Sal Forest area from 1991 to 2000 and from 2000 to 2010. Interestingly, there was no conversation of the Sal Forest area to other land use from 2010 to 2020, and the prediction showed that the Sal Forest area will be increased by 52.02% in 2040. The preservation and increment of the Sal Forest area suggested strong governmental policy implementation to preserve the forest.","",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2023.e15617,"",,

The high spatial and temporal coverage provided by satellite data can be used to reconstruct past events and continuously monitor sensitive areas for potential hazards. This paper presents a range of techniques and methods that were applied for in-depth analysis and utilization of Earth observation data, with a particular emphasis on: (1) detecting mining subsidence, where a novel approach is proposed by combining an improved U-Net model and Interferometry Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) technology. The results showed that the Efficient Channel Attention (ECA) U-Net model performed better than the U-Net (baseline) model in terms of Mean Intersection over Union (MIoU) and Intersection over Union (IoU) indicators; (2) monitoring water conservancy and hydropower engineering. The Xiaolangdi multipurpose dam complex was monitored using Small BAsline Subsets (SBAS) InSAR method on Sentinel-1 time series data and four small regions with high deformation rates were identified on the slope of the reservoir bank on the north side. The dam body also showed obvious deformation with a velocity exceeding 60 mm/a; (3) the evaluation of the potential of InSAR results to integrate monitoring and warning systems for valuable heritage and architectural preservation. The overall outcome of these methods showed that the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques in combination with InSAR data leads to more efficient analysis and interpretation, resulting in improved accuracy and prompt identification of potential hazards; and (4) finally, this study also presents a method for detecting landslides in mountainous regions, using optical imagery. The new temporal landslide detection method is evaluated over a 7-year analysis period and unlike conventional bi-temporal change detection methods, this approach does not depend on any prior-knowledge and can potentially detect landslides over extended periods of time such as decades.","",https://doi.org/10.1080/10095020.2023.2234008,"",,
rayyan-220227382,War and Deforestation: Using Remote Sensing and Machine Learning to Identify the War-Induced Deforestation in Syria 2010–2019,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Armed conflicts and other types of violence are key drivers of human-induced landscape change. Since March 2011, Syria has been embroiled in a prolonged and devastating armed conflict causing immense human suffering and extensive destruction. As a result, over five million people have been forced to seek refuge outside the country’s borders, while more than six million have been internally displaced. This study focuses on examining the impact of this conflict on forest cover by identifying the drivers of forest change. To assess this change, Landsat and PALSAR imagery were used to differentiate between forested and non-forested areas. Spectral information was synthetized using the Tasseled Cap transformation and the time series data was simplified and despiked using the LandTrendr algorithm. Our results show that between 2010 and 2019 there was a substantial decrease of 19.3% in forest cover, predominantly concentrated in the northwestern region of Syria. This decline was induced by the armed conflict, with several key drivers contributing to the decline, such as illegal logging activities conducted by both locals and refugees living in nearby forest areas. Drivers such as proximity to refugee camps, roads, and settlements played an important role in producing this change by facilitating access to forests. In addition, the occurrence of explosive events such as bombings and shelling near forests also contributed to this decline by causing forest fires. To mitigate further deforestation and reduce dependence on forests for fuel, it is crucial for local governments in the post-conflict period to offer sustainable alternatives for heating and cooking to both the local populations and refugees. Additionally, governments are recommended to enforce strict laws and regulations to protect forests and combat illegal logging activities. These measures are essential for preserving and restoring forests, promoting environmental sustainability, and ensuring the well-being of both displaced populations and local communities.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/land12081509,"",,

Furthermore, continued decline of forest areas will critically hinder the accomplishment of carbon neutrality goals. Although the geographical location of deforestation can now be rapidly and accurately detected with remote sensing technology, current forest change products are still not fine-grained, especially from the perspective of carbon trading. Here, we used a deep learning method to detect deforestation in large regions based on 2 m high-resolution optical remote sensing images. Firstly, we proposed a new deforestation detection dataset, which was generated from 11 provincial regions in the Yangtze River Economic Zone of China, containing a total number of 8330 samples (the size of each sample being 512 × 512 pixels). Then, a new deforestation detection model, SiamHRnet-OCR, was designed, based on this dataset. Compared with other deep learning models, SiamHRnet-OCR achieves better results in terms of precision, F1-score, and OA indicator: 0.6482, 0.6892, and 0.9898, respectively. Finally, two large-scale scenarios of deforestation experiments in Southern China were further tested; the deforestation detection results demonstrate that SiamHRnet-OCR can not only detect deforestation effectively but also capture the accurate boundary of the changing area.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/rs15020463,"",,

This study explored the implications of the changing land-use diversity on surface water resources by using a random forest (RF) classifier machine-learning algorithm and remote-sensing models in Gauteng Province, South Africa. Landsat datasets from 1993 to 2022 were used and processed in the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform, using the RF classifier.

In recent years, there has been a surging interest in applying data-driven methods based on machine learning for solving core problems such as weather forecasting and climate downscaling. Despite promising results, much of this progress has been impaired due to the lack of large-scale, open-source efforts for reproducibility, resulting in the use of inconsistent or underspecified datasets, training setups, and evaluations by both domain scientists and artificial intelligence researchers. We introduce ClimateLearn, an open-source PyTorch library that vastly simplifies the training and evaluation of machine learning models for data-driven climate science. ClimateLearn consists of holistic pipelines for dataset processing (e.g., ERA5, CMIP6, PRISM), implementation of state-of-the-art deep learning models (e.g., Transformers, ResNets), and quantitative and qualitative evaluation for standard weather and climate modeling tasks. We supplement these functionalities with extensive documentation, contribution guides, and quickstart tutorials to expand access and promote community growth. We have also performed comprehensive forecasting and downscaling experiments to showcase the capabilities and key features of our library.

The recent release of ChatGPT in November 2022 represents one of the biggest advancements in AI since AlphaGo won the first-ever game against a human professional Go player in 2015. Machine learning (ML)—one of the AI tools—is able to solve complex relationships in a system, handle big data, improve its own efficiency and predictability with more data, learn new knowledge (i.e., unknowns) through deep learning (DL), and evolve open-access algorithms and data from diverse disciplines (LeCun et al., 2015). These advantageous capabilities, coupled with rapid advancements in computing power, have been recognized in all fields of science and engineering, as is evidenced by the cascading escalations in their applications. One major reason for the widespread and speedy adoption of ML technology is because the human brain has a limited capacity for comprehending large, complex systems. Scholars and practitioners in natural science have adopted various MLs to address basic and applied challenges, such as modeling complex causes, processes, and consequences in the Earth system at multiple temporal and spatial scales (Reichstein et al., 2019). The Earth system is traditionally examined through the construction of simulation models, also known as Earth system models (ESMs; sometimes called terrestrial biosphere models, Sun et al., 2023), built to estimate past, current, and future conditions. ESMs evolved from a suite of simple algorithms (Chen, 2021) to approximate the complex interactions among components of the Earth system (Fisher & Koven, 2020; Gettelman et al., 2022). ESMs are capable of integrating critical processes from atmospheric science, biogeochemistry, biological systems, human influences, and ecosystem processes to meet the diverse needs of multiple disciplines. Yet, modern ESMs pose unprecedented challenges, such as the number and types of ESMs (30+ in CMIP6 of IPCC; Smith et al., 2020), the high number of potential parameters (hundreds to thousands), complex architecture and structure, accurate values of the parameters (i.e., parameterizations), large discrepancies among the models and high uncertainty for their predictions, and applications at high spatial and temporal resolutions (Schaefer et al., 2012). An even greater challenge arises from the computing time, which hinders their practical use, especially at landscape-regional scales. Sun and colleagues recently looked into whether ML tools could be good alternatives of conventional ESMs for predicting the functions of terrestrial ecosystems (Sun et al., 2023). In their pioneering work, they applied the same input variables (27) to three versions of ORCHIDEE (i.e., a major ESM) and Baggin decision trees (i.e., a ML tool) for predicting terrestrial carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorous at global scale. They demonstrated that ML reduced the computing demand by 78–80% while maintaining similar or even more accurate predictions than ORCHIDEEs. Such reductions are substantial, though computing power soon may no longer be a bottleneck hindering ESM runs due to rapid advancements in computing technology. An equally important finding in the Sun et al. study relates to the contributions of input variables for predicting carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus production. It was especially interesting to see that ML only required a small number of input variables (20–25) compared to a similar number of input variables to reach better accuracy in predictions using ORCHIDEE for different components of carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus (figures 2–4, respectively, in Sun et al., 2023). Over the past century, quantitative models in climatology, forestry, agronomy, ecology, and other fields have evolved from a few algorithms with a few input variables for predicting system functions to hundreds of equations and thousands of variables so that all interested processes are modeled (Chen, 2021). Consequently, the number of input variables for ESMs continues to increase despite difficulties in generating reasonable values at pixel level (a.k.a. tiles). For example, we often are faced with a lack of accurate and dynamic global land cover maps, as well as associated land surface properties, for parameterizing ESMs. Even more challenging is deriving accurate values for all the intermediate variables and their relationships for a specified time and location. Understanding and revising the structure, logic connections, and parameterizations are the major focuses of modelers. While inclusion of more processes (i.e., more algorithms) has the benefit of integrating more knowledge into the models and meet the needs of diverse disciplines, there are also values in reducing the number of parameters and algorithms so that an ESM can be applied for various purposes without the need to understand the details of all mechanisms, as well as without access of supercomputers. We can anticipate an increase in the development of ESMs that can be parameterized and run by non-modelers and applied to broader applications, including ecosystem, landscape, and regional applications where spatial resolutions of 10–25 km and temporal resolutions of less than a month (e.g., day, hours, etc.) are often needed for location-specific applications (e.g., Zou et al., 2022). Were ML tools applied with a small number of input variables, without the need for in-depth knowledge of detailed processes and algorithms, and with accurate predictions as demonstrated in Sun et al. (2023) and others (e.g., Pal & Sharma, 2021), our knowledge, resource management, adaptation strategies, and policy making would be significantly and promptly improved. I am particularly excited to see that predicted C, N, and P from MLs do not always match well with those of ORCHIDEE (figure 5 in Sun et al., 2023), and the ranks of important forcing factors are not the same among plant functional types (figure 6). Among the 15 PFTs, not only are the lists of significant drivers different, but their ranks in importance vary greatly as well. While these results are expected and have been reported in other recent publications (e.g., Irvin et al., 2021), a major take-away is that our efforts to estimate the values of input variables should be weighted by PFT, prediction purposes (e.g., carbon vs. nitrogen), location, and so forth. These lessons have direct implications for ML applications when used as alternatives. In sum, Sun and colleagues provide a unique and promising exploration of the application of ML on the complex contingent regulations of biogeochemical processes that are the focuses of ESMs. Based on a recent review of the literature, Pal and Sharma (2021) concluded that that ML-based techniques can enhance performance, reduce uncertainties, improve parameter optimization, and improve predictions. The needs for incorporating MLs into conventional process-based modeling frameworks, such as improving parameterization or replacing a less-constrained or semi-empirical sub-model, have also been highlighted (Reichstein et al., 2019). However, there are thousands of ML algorithms, with new ones emerging daily. Traditional ML learns and predicts based on passive observations (e.g., random forests, boosted decision trees, etc.), whereas DL focuses on an agent interacting with an environment to learn and take actions that maximize its chance of success in achieving its goals (Alpaydin, 2020). For example, both recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and graphic neural networks (GNNs) have recently gained the ability to grasp temporal and spatial relationships and variable-length data (Hinton et al., 2012; Reed et al., 2021)—the exact cases in ESMs where pixels are spatially and temporally correlated. Here, RNN and GNN enable us to connect nodes as a directed graph along a temporal/spatial sequence, thereby addressing the temporal and spatial dependencies of input, intermediate, and output variables in ESMs. Because conventional ML assumes that data are independent and identically distributed, it cannot take advantage of the information available in temporal correlations, nor can it address the consequences of rare, abrupt changes in climate forcings (e.g., extremes) or human disturbances on variables in ESMs. Future efforts will likely be expanded from Sun et al. (2023) to explore different DL tools that may be more computationally effective, easy-to-use, and more accurate projections than ESMs. Open Research DATA AVAILABILITY STATEMENT No data were as used for this commentary.

rayyan-220227423,Predicting Biomass Yields of Advanced Switchgrass Cultivars for Bioenergy and Ecosystem Services Using Machine Learning,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"The production of advanced perennial bioenergy crops within marginal areas of the agricultural landscape is gaining interest due to its potential to sustainably produce feedstocks for biofuels and bioproducts while also improving the sustainability and resilience of commodity crop production. However, predicting the biomass yields of this production system is challenging because marginal areas are often relatively small and spread around agricultural fields and are typically associated with various abiotic conditions that limit crop production. Machine learning (ML) offers a viable solution as a biomass yield prediction tool because it is suited to predicting relationships with complex functional associations. The objectives of this study were to (1) evaluate the accuracy of commonly applied ML algorithms in agricultural applications for predicting the biomass yields of advanced switchgrass cultivars for bioenergy and ecosystem services and (2) determine the most important biomass yield predictors. Datasets on biomass yield, weather, land marginality, soil properties, and agronomic management were generated from three field study sites in two U.S. Midwest states (Illinois and Iowa) over three growing seasons. The ML algorithms evaluated in the study included random forests (RFs), gradient boosting machines (GBMs), artificial neural networks (ANNs), K-neighbors regressor (KNR), AdaBoost regressor (ABR), and partial least squares regression (PLSR). Coefficient of determination (R2) and mean absolute error (MAE) were used to evaluate the predictive accuracy of the tested algorithms. Results showed that the ensemble methods, RF (R2 = 0.86, MAE = 0.62 Mg/ha), GBM (R2 = 0.88, MAE = 0.57 Mg/ha), and GBM (R2 = 0.78, MAE = 0.66 Mg/ha), were the most accurate in predicting biomass yields of the Independence, Liberty, and Shawnee switchgrass cultivars, respectively. This is in agreement with similar studies that apply ML to multi-feature problems where traditional statistical methods are less applicable and datasets used were considered to be relatively small for ANNs. Consistent with previous studies on switchgrass, the most important predictors of biomass yield included average annual temperature, average growing season temperature, sum of the growing season precipitation, field slope, and elevation. This study helps pave the way for applying ML as a management tool for alternative bioenergy landscapes where understanding agronomic and environmental performance of a multifunctional cropping system seasonally and interannually at the sub-field scale is critical.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/en16104168,"",,

There are many problems in terms of land use in China, such as extensive development, significant regional differences, and imbalanced development. From this perspective, it is imperative to study systematic land use evolution according to local contexts. In this study, two methods that are commonly used to solve complexity issues— “top-down” system dynamics and “bottom-up” cellular automata—were combined to investigate the land use evolutionary trend in Ya’an City. Firstly, a system dynamics model of land resource use was constructed based on the causal relationship between land and macroscopic elements, and the quantitative future predictions of land use structures in Ya’an were obtained. Next, an ANN-CA model containing three steps—artificial neural network training, optimization of cellular automata parameters, and model calibration—was constructed. The land use scenario in Ya’an City in 2018 was simulated and the quantity and space accuracy verification were conducted. Finally, the spatial layout of land use in Ya’an City in 2028 and 2038 was predicted, and the land use evolution trend was studied using the model under the constraint of the quantitative prediction results of system dynamics. The results demonstrated the good simulation effect of the ANN-CA model under the SD constraint. The overall simulation accuracy of the model is the highest (93.93%) when the threshold of transformation is 0.8 and the diffusion coefficient is 1. In the future, the spatial distribution of different land types in Ya’an City will change slightly, and construction land presents an expansion law from the center to surrounding areas.","",https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-3634077/v1,"",,
rayyan-220227543,"Navigating nature’s toll: Assessing the ecological impact of the refugee crisis in Cox’s Bazar, Bangladesh",,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"The Rohingya crisis in Myanmar's Rakhine state has resulted in a significant influx of refugees into Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh. However, the ecological impact of this migration has received limited attention in research. This study aimed to address this gap by utilizing remote sensing data and machine learning techniques to model the ecological quality (EQ) of the region before and after the refugee influx. To quantify changes in land use and land cover (LULC), three supervised machine learning classification methods, namely artificial neural networks (ANN), support vector machines (SVM), and random forests (RF), were applied. The most accurate LULC maps obtained from these methods were then used to assess changes in ecosystem service valuation and function resulting from the land use changes. Furthermore, fuzzy logic models were employed to examine the EQ conditions before and after the Rohingya influx. The findings of the study indicate that the increased number of Rohingya refugees has led to a 9.58% decrease in forest area, accompanied by an 8.25% increase in settlement areas. The estimated total ecosystem services value (ESV) in the research area was $67.83 million in 2017 and $67.78 million in 2021, respectively. The ESV for forests experienced a significant decline of 21.97%, equivalent to a decrease of $5.33 million. Additionally, the reduction in forest lands has contributed to a 13.58% decline in raw materials and a 14.57% decline in biodiversity. Furthermore, utilizing a Markovian transition probability model, our analysis reveals that the EQ conditions in the area have deteriorated from ""very good"" or ""good"" to ""bad"" or ""very bad"" following the Rohingya influx. The findings of this study emphasize the importance of integrating ecological considerations into decision-making processes and developing proactive measures to mitigate the environmental impact of such large-scale migrations.","",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2023.e18255,"",,
rayyan-220227563,"Determination of future land use changes using remote sensing imagery and artificial neural network algorithm: A case study of Davao City, Philippines",,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Land use and land cover (LULC) changes refer to alterations in land use or physical characteristics. These changes can be caused by human activities, such as urbanization, agriculture, and resource extraction, as well as natural phenomena, for example, erosion and climate change. LULC changes significantly impact ecosystem services, biodiversity, and human welfare. In this study, LULC changes in Davao City, Philippines, were simulated, predicted, and projected using a multilayer perception artificial neural network (MLP-ANN) model. The MLP-ANN model was employed to analyze the impact of elevation and proximity to road networks (i.e., exploratory maps) on changes in LULC from 2017 to 2021. The predicted 2021 LULC map shows a high correlation to the actual LULC map of 2021, with a kappa index of 0.91 and a 96.68% accuracy. The MLP-ANN model was applied to project LULC changes in the future (i.e., 2030 and 2050). The results suggest that in 2030, the built-up area and trees are increasing by 4.50% and 2.31%, respectively. Unfortunately, water will decrease by up to 0.34%, and crops is about to decrease by approximately 3.25%. In the year 2050, the built-up area will continue to increase to 6.89%, while water and crops will decrease by 0.53% and 3.32%, respectively. Overall, the results show that anthropogenic activities influence the land's alterations.

rayyan-220227566,An AI approach to operationalise global daily PlanetScope satellite imagery for river water masking,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Monitoring rivers is vital to manage the invaluable ecosystem services they provide, and also to mitigate the risks they pose to property and life through flooding and drought. Due to the vast extent and dynamic nature of river systems, Earth Observation (EO) is one of the best ways to measure river characteristics. As a first step, EO-based river monitoring often requires extraction of accurate pixel-level water masks, but satellite images traditionally used for this purpose suffer from limited spatial and/or temporal resolution. We address this problem by applying a novel Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based model to automate water mask extraction from daily 3 m resolution PlanetScope satellite imagery. Notably, this approach overcomes radiometric issues that frequently present limitations when working with CubeSat data. We test our classification model on 36 rivers across 12 global terrestrial biomes (as proxies for the environmental and physical characteristics that lead to the variability in catchments around the globe). Using a relatively shallow CNN classification model, our approach produced a median F1 accuracy score of 0.93, suggesting that a compact and efficient CNN-based model can work as well as, if not better than, the very deep neural networks conventionally used in similar studies, whilst requiring less training data and computational power. We further show that our model, specialised to the task at hand, performs better than a state-of-the-art Fully Convolutional Neural Network (FCN) that struggles with the highly variable image quality from PlanetScope. Although classifying rivers that were narrower than 60 m, anastomosed or highly urbanised was slightly less successful than our other test images, we showed that fine tuning could circumvent these limitations to some degree. Indeed, fine tuning carried out on the Ottawa River, Canada, by including just 5 additional site-specific training images significantly improved classification accuracy (F1 increased from 0.81 to 0.90, p < 0.01). Overall, our results show that CNN-based classification applied to PlanetScope imagery is a viable tool for producing accurate, temporally dynamic river water masks, opening up possibilities for river monitoring investigations where high temporal variability data is essential.","",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2023.113932,"",,
rayyan-220227568,Machine Learning as a Strategic Tool for Helping Cocoa Farmers in Côte D’Ivoire,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Machine learning can be used for social good. The employment of artificial intelligence in smart agriculture has many benefits for the environment: it helps small farmers (at a local scale) and policymakers and cooperatives (at regional scale) to take valid and coordinated countermeasures to combat climate change. This article discusses how artificial intelligence in agriculture can help to reduce costs, especially in developing countries such as Côte d'Ivoire, employing only low-cost or open-source tools, from hardware to software and open data. We developed machine learning models for two tasks: the first is improving agricultural farming cultivation, and the second is water management. For the first task, we used deep neural networks (YOLOv5m) to detect healthy plants and pods of cocoa and damaged ones only using mobile phone images. The results confirm it is possible to distinguish well the healthy from damaged ones. For actions at a larger scale, the second task proposes the analysis of remote sensors, coming from the GRACE NASA Mission and ERA5, produced by the Copernicus climate change service. A new deep neural network architecture (CIWA-net) is proposed with a U-Net-like architecture, aiming to forecast the total water storage anomalies.

They are an important habitat for many animal and plant species and offer a variety of ecological functions. Diverse plant communities have evolved over time depending on environmental and management factors in grasslands. These different plant communities offer multiple ecosystem services and also have an effect on the forage value of fodder for domestic livestock. However, with increasing intensification in agriculture and the loss of SNGs, the biodiversity of grasslands continues to decline. In this paper, we present a method to spatially classify plant communities in grasslands in order to identify and map plant communities and weed species that occur in a semi-natural meadow. For this, high-resolution multispectral remote sensing data were captured by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) in regular intervals and classified by a convolutional neural network (CNN). As the study area, a heterogeneous semi-natural hay meadow with first- and second-growth vegetation was chosen. Botanical relevés of fixed plots were used as ground truth and independent test data. Accuracies up to 88% on these independent test data were achieved, showing the great potential of the usage of CNNs for plant community mapping in high-resolution UAV data for ecological and agricultural applications.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/rs15071945,"",,

In this study, land use maps for the periods 1984 and 2012, derived from Landsat TM satellite imagery, were used. The goal of this study is comparison of three procedures of artificial neural network, logistic regression, and similarity weighted instance-based learning (SIM Weight) to predict spatial trend of forest cover change. The SimWeight considers the nearest instances in the variable space, which are computed based on past changes and the relative importance of the driving variables. The LogReg approach, on the other hand, is a type of generalized linear model that assumes that the current land use pattern reflects the processes of land use in the past. Artificial Neural Network is a nonparametric algorithm that is capable of fitting complex nonlinear functions to find the relations between past changes and their driving variables. Such approaches are expected to produce better fitting between the change potential and their complex relationships with their driving variables.

Accurate forest flame segmentation is vital for effective fire management and protection of ecosystems. It improves detection, response, and understanding of fire behavior. Due to the easy accessibility and rich information content of forest remote sensing images, remote sensing techniques are frequently applied in forest flame segmentation. With the advancement of deep learning, convolutional neural network (CNN) techniques have been widely adopted for forest flame segmentation and have achieved remarkable results. However, forest remote sensing images often have high resolutions, and relative to the entire image, forest flame regions are relatively small, resulting in class imbalance issues. Additionally, mainstream semantic segmentation methods are limited by the receptive field of CNNs, making it challenging to effectively extract global features from the images and leading to poor segmentation performance when relying solely on labeled datasets. To address these issues, we propose a method based on the deeplabV3+ model, incorporating the following design strategies: (1) an adaptive Copy-Paste data augmentation method is introduced to learn from challenging samples (Images that cannot be adequately learned due to class imbalance and other factors) effectively, (2) transformer modules are concatenated and parallelly integrated into the encoder, while a CBAM attention mechanism is added to the decoder to fully extract image features, and (3) a dice loss is introduced to mitigate the class imbalance problem. By conducting validation on our self-constructed dataset, our approach has demonstrated superior performance across multiple metrics compared to current state-of-the-art semantic segmentation methods.

rayyan-220227652,Future climate change may pose pressures on greenhouse gas emission reduction in China’s rice production,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Paddy rice cultivation is a vital food source but also a significant contributor to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, particularly methane. Management measures such as improved water management and fertilization are being pursued to sustain rice production while cutting down the emissions. However, climate change may pose further challenges for sustainable rice agriculture by either impacting rice production or GHG emissions. Based on a database consisting of 1216 observations across China, we established machine learning models predicting rice yield and GHG emissions, taking into account climate, soil, and management variables. We tested three machine learning methods including random forest, support vector machine and artificial neural networks. The models were trained on 70% of the dataset with the remaining 30% used to evaluate the model performance. Random forest performed best with R2 of 0.59 to 0.72 and modelling efficiency of 52% to 72%. Farmland management emerged as the most important variable to the model prediction, followed by climate and soil variables. Rice production and GHG emissions were estimated to be 245.36 Tg and 218.95 Tg CO2-eq in 2018, respectively. By the year 2050, rice yield was expected to experience a modest decrease ranging from 0.6% to 1.2% due to the combined effects of global change variables, but GHG emissions were projected to increase by 2.1% to 4.9% under different climate change scenarios (Representative Concentration Pathways) in China. A large spatial variability in the impact of climate change was observed, and climate change will have the most significant impact in the Northeast agricultural region of China due to the warming effect. Through the analysis of region-specific farmland management scenarios, this study underscores a ""Code Red"" situation, signifying that future climate change could pose unprecedented risks to the sustainability of rice production in China, despite ongoing management improvements.","",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2023.116732,"",,

The heterogeneity of the fragments is a challenge for the characterization and quantification of forest resources, such as the stock of biomass and carbon. Methodologies based on remote sensing have been used, to improve these estimates without compromising execution costs. The objective was to estimate, with high spatial resolution passive remote sensing, the aboveground carbon stock in fragments of different successional stages of the Atlantic Forest. Forests were classified into initial, intermediate, and advanced successional stages. In each stratum, 10 plots (20x50 m) were established, and the carbon stock was calculated by adjusted Schumacher and Hall model. The reflectances of the blue, green, red, and near-infrared bands and vegetation indices (VIs) were obtained in the dry and rainy seasons, from MSI/Sentinel-2 images, with a resolution of 10 m. Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), with different combinations of variables, were trained and validated with simulated reflectance values. Carbon was estimated by ANN with the best performance in training and validation. The average carbon stock in the initial, intermediate, and advanced strata was 24.99, 35.79 and 82.28 Mg ha−1, respectively, with a general average of 47.68 Mg ha−1. The carbon estimates were better with the ANN trained with the reflectances of the rainy season. The addition of VIs did not improve ANN performance.

To explore the evolution process from meteorological to hydrological and agricultural drought further, multi-source remote sensing data, including the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) product, were collected in the Huaihe River basin of China during 2002–2020. Three machine learning methods, including long short-term memory neural network (LSTM), convolutional neural network (CNN), and categorical boosting (CatBoost), were constructed for hydrological and agricultural drought forecasting. The propagation time from meteorological drought to surface water storage and terrestrial water storage drought, evaluated by the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index, was 8 and 11 months with Pearson correlation coefficients (R) of 0.68 and 0.48, respectively. Groundwater storage drought was correlated with evapotranspiration and vegetation growth with a 12-month lag time, respectively. In addition, vegetation growth was affected by the drought of soil moisture at depths ranging from 100 to 200 cm with an 8-month lag time with an R of −0.39. Although the forecasting performances of terrestrial water storage drought were better than those of groundwater storage drought and agricultural drought, CNN always performed better than LSTM and CatBoost models, with Nash–Sutclife efficiency values during testing ranging from 0.28 to 0.70, 0.26 to 0.33, and −0.10 to −0.40 for terrestrial water storage drought, groundwater storage drought, and agricultural drought at lead times of 0–3 months, respectively. Furthermore, splitting training and testing data at random significantly improved the performances of CNN and CatBoost methods for drought forecasting rather than in chronological order splitting for non-stationary data.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/rs15235524,"",,

Forest fires have devastating effects on biodiversity, climate, and humans. Producing detailed and reliable forest fire susceptibility maps is crucial for disaster management. Data-driven machine learning methods can be applied for forest fire susceptibility mapping, and learning data required for this purpose can be obtained from high-resolution satellite imagery along with a fire inventory. In this study, we assessed the performances of Random Forest (RF) and artificial neural network (ANN) classifiers for producing forest fire susceptibility maps of a region in north-east Türkiye covering Trabzon, Gümüşhane, Rize, and Bayburt provinces using freely available Earth observation data and forest inventory provided by the regional directorate. Forest type, EU-DEM v1.1 (25 m), and tree cover density were retrieved from Copernicus Land Monitoring Service. Sentinel-2 images were utilized for calculating spectral indices such as normalized difference vegetation index and modified normalized difference water index to assess surface water and vegetation characteristics. Thus, a total of twelve variables including topographic, anthropogenic, hydrologic, vegetation and land use data were used as input. The RF and ANN illustrated similar prediction performances based on receiver operating characteristics (ROC) area under the curve (AUC) values, which were 0.89 and 0.88, respectively. The RF performed better in terms of overall accuracy and F-1 score. The susceptibility maps with 25 m resolution were also investigated visually. The ANN results predicted higher susceptibility levels and larger areas were found prone to wildfire. Leave-one-out analysis results indicated that elevation was the most influential factor based on the achieved OA.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/isprs-archives-xlviii-m-1-2023-161-2023,"",,

Land use changes leading to land degradation and deforestation have been a prime mover for changes in the climate. This necessitates accurately assessing land use dynamics using a machine-learning algorithm’s temporal remote sensing data. The current study investigates land use using the temporal Landsat data from 1973 to 2021 in Chikamagaluru district, Karnataka. The land cover analysis showed 2.77% decrease in vegetation cover. The performance of three supervised learning techniques, namely Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Maximum Likelihood classifier (MLC) were assessed, and results reveal that RF has performed better with an overall accuracy of 90.22% and a kappa value of 0.85. Land use classification has been performed with supervised machine learning classifier Random Forest (RF), which showed a decrease in the forest cover (48.91%) with an increase of agriculture (6.13%), horticulture (43.14%) and built-up cover (2.10%). Forests have been shrinking due to anthropogenic forces, especially forest encroachment for agriculture and industrial development, resulting in forest fragmentation and habitat loss. The fragmentation analysis provided the structural change in the forest cover, where interior forest cover was lost by 27.67% from 1973 to 2021, which highlights intense anthropogenic pressure even in the core Western Ghats regions with dense forests.

We identified drivers of solar siting and quantified patterns of buildout in states surrounding the Chesapeake Bay watershed – a biodiversity hotspot with numerous ecosystem services. Using a convolutional neural network, we mapped the footprints of ground-mounted solar arrays present in satellite imagery annually from 2017 to 2021 in Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania, New York, Virginia, and West Virginia. As of 2021, we identified 958 solar arrays covering 52.3 km2 built primarily on previously cultivated land, while avoiding natural landcover. We fit a binomial-Weibull model to these solar timeseries data in a hierarchical, Bayesian framework to quantify the relationship between geospatial covariates and rate of solar development. Solar array construction rate increased in cultivated areas, areas of lower agricultural suitability, lower slope, lower forest cover, lower biodiversity protection, and greater distances from roads. We also estimated changes in the rate of solar construction over time and found differences among states: acceleration in Virginia and deceleration in New York. We used parameter estimates to map the relative likelihood of future solar development across the study area. This methodology can be used to anticipate where solar is likely to be built in different landscapes and how these patterns align with conservation goals. Around the Chesapeake Bay watershed, the selection of lower quality agricultural areas for solar energy minimizes removal of important habitat and provides opportunities for native plant and pollinator restoration.","",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2023.110074,"",,

In this paper, we discuss how it can be used to combat climate change and facilitate land management and farming in developing countries and in particular in C&amp;ocirc;te d&amp;rsquo;Ivoire. This paper explores models that improve land and water management and agricultural farming cultivation to contrast climate change. C&amp;ocirc;te d&amp;rsquo;Ivoire is the largest producer of cocoa beans (43%) in the world, but deforestation, lack of rainfall, drought, and climate change threaten crops and the already fragile economy of Ivorian farmers. It is important to combat climate change with methods and techniques that are affordable to the local farmers and also induce positive effects in production. We discuss the use of low-cost sensors to collect data on the soil and open data and open source software to develop AI tools. We show that using deep neural networks (YOLOv5m) is effective for detecting healthy plants and pods of cocoa from damaged ones only using mobile phone images. Focusing on a single land is not enough to combat climate change, which has different causes and involves also knowledge at a higher scale. We propose a new method of forecasting for the analysis of remote sensors. Remote sensor data come from GRACE NASA Mission and ERA5 produced by the Copernicus Climate Change Service at ECMWF. We implement a new deep neural network architecture named CIWA-net. It is based on a Fully Convolutional Neural Network (FCN) [ 1] and it is a U-net like architecture [2]. The aim of CIWA-net is to forecast Total Water Storage Anomalies (TWSA). We show the quality of our model with a comparison to a vanilla Convolutional Neural Network. CIWA-net could be used also for the detection of lands that interfere with agricultural work and yields, such as deserted areas, water-soaking soil areas, zones at risk of desertification, and poor land use. The employment of AI at the service of agriculture can decrease crop losses and waste, lower the inputs onto the soil of fertilizers, responsible for the increase of Greenhouse Gases. It could be useful to help the small farmers (at a local scale) and also the policy-makers and farmers&amp;rsquo; cooperatives (at the regional scale) to take valid and coordinated countermeasures to improve the correct use of the lands, helping to contrast and adapt to climate change.","",https://doi.org/10.20944/preprints202308.0416.v1,"",,

The existing learning-based Chl-a prediction methods mostly predict a single point or multiple points with monitoring data. However, the monitoring data are subject to sparse sampling and difficult to be measured in a large-scale and synchronous way. Moreover, the advanced learning-based models for point Chl-a prediction, such as long short-term memory (LSTM) and convolutional neural network (CNN)-LSTM, are unable to fully mining the spatio-temporal correlation of Chl-a variations. Therefore, by using the satellite remote sensing data with extensive coverage, we design a framework, namely Ca-STANet, to simultaneously predict the Chl-a of all the locations in a large-scale area from the perspective of spatio-temporal field. Specifically in our method, the original data are firstly divided into multiple sub-regions to capture the spatial heterogeneity of large-scale area. Then, two modules are respectively operated to mine the spatial correlation and long-term dependency features. Finally, the outputs from the two modules are integrated by a fusion module to fully mine the spatio-temporal correlations, which are exploited to attain the final Chl-a prediction. In this paper, the proposed Ca-STANet is comprehensively evaluated and compared with the legacy methods based on the OC-CCI Chl-a 5.0 data of the Bohai Sea. The results demonstrate that the proposed Ca-STANet is highly effective for Chl-a prediction and achieves higher prediction accuracy than the baseline methods. Moreover, as the OC-CCI Chl-a 5.0 data have many missing areas, we introduce DINEOF method to fill the data gaps before using them for prediction.","",https://doi.org/10.1109/tgrs.2023.3262749,"",,

This research identifies, interprets, and explains the feedback sensitivities attributed to permafrost degradation and terrestrial carbon cycling imbalance with in situ and flux tower measurements, remote sensing observations, process-based modeling simulations, and deep learning architecture. We defined and formulated high-resolution polymodal datasets with multitemporal extents and hyperspatiospectral fidelity (i.e., 12.4 million parameters with 13.1 million in situ data points, 2.84 billion ground-controlled remotely sensed data points, and 36.58 million model-based simulation outputs to computationally reflect the state space of the earth system), simulated the non-linear feedback mechanisms attributed to permafrost degradation and carbon cycle perturbation across Alaska with a process-constrained deep learning architecture composed of cascading stacks of convolutionally layered memory-encoded recurrent neural networks (i.e., GeoCryoAI), and interpreted historical and future emulations of freeze-thaw dynamics and the permafrost carbon feedback with a suite of evaluation and performance metrics (e.g., cross-entropic loss, root-mean-square deviation, accuracy). This framework introduces ecological memory components and effectively learns subtle spatiotemporal covariate complexities in high-latitude ecosystems by emulating permafrost degradation and carbon flux dynamics across Alaska with high precision and minimal loss (RMSE: 1.007cm, 0.694nmolCH4m-2s-1, 0.213µmolCO2m-2s-1).

Earth's drylands are home to more than two billion people, provide key ecosystem services, and exert a large influence on the trends and variability in Earth's carbon cycle. However, modeling dryland carbon and water fluxes with remote sensing suffers from unique challenges not typically encountered in mesic systems, particularly in capturing soil moisture stress. Here, we develop and evaluate an approach for the joint modeling of dryland gross primary production (GPP), net ecosystem exchange (NEE), and evapotranspiration (ET) in the western United States (US) using a suite of AmeriFlux eddy covariance sites spanning major functional types and aridity regimes. We use artificial neural networks (ANNs) to predict dryland ecosystem fluxes by fusing optical vegetation indices, multitemporal thermal observations, and microwave soil moisture and temperature retrievals from the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) sensor. Our new dryland ANN (DrylANNd) carbon and water flux model explains more than 70 % of monthly variance in GPP and ET, improving upon existing MODIS GPP and ET estimates at most dryland eddy covariance sites. DrylANNd predictions of NEE were considerably worse than its predictions of GPP and ET likely because soil and plant respiratory processes are largely invisible to satellite sensors. Optical vegetation indices, particularly the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and near-infrared reflectance of vegetation (NIRv), were generally the most important variables contributing to model skill. However, daytime and nighttime land surface temperatures and SMAP soil moisture and soil temperature also contributed to model skill, with SMAP especially improving model predictions of shrubland, grassland, and savanna fluxes and land surface temperatures improving predictions in evergreen needleleaf forests. Our results show that a combination of optical vegetation indices and thermal infrared and microwave observations can substantially improve estimates of carbon and water fluxes in drylands, potentially providing the means to better monitor vegetation function and ecosystem services in these important regions that are undergoing rapid hydroclimatic change.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-383-2023,"",,

In this context, we evaluate historical and future associations between land use land cover changes and land surface temperature in Dera Ghazi Khan–one of the top cities in Pakistan–using multi-temporal Landsat data over two decades (2002–2022). After assessing current land use changes and future predictions, their impact on land surface temperature and urban heat island effect is measured using machine learning via Multi-Layer Perceptron-Markov Chain, Artificial Neural Network and Cellular Automata. Significant changes in land use land cover were observed in the last two decades. The built-up area expanded greatly (874 ha) while agriculture land (−687 ha) and barren land (−253 ha) show decreasing trend. The water bodies were found the lowest changes (57 ha) and vegetation cover got the largest proportion in all the years. This green-grey conversion in the last two decades (8.7%) and prospect along the main corridors show the gravity of unplanned urban growth at the cost of vegetation and agricultural land (−6.8%). The land surface temperature and urban heat island effect shows a strong positive correlation between urbanization and vegetation removal. The simulation results presented in this study confirm that by 2032, the city will face a 5° C high mean temperature based on historical patterns, which could potentially lead to more challenges associated with urban heat island if no appropriate measures are taken. It is expected that due to land cover changes by 2032, ~60% of urban and peri-urban areas will experience very hot to hot temperatures (&amp;gt; 31.5°C). Our results provide baseline information to urban managers and planners to understand the increasing trends of land surface temperature in response to land cover changes.

First, we used an orthomosaic (1998) and two WorldView-2 satellite images (2004 and 2010), to detect land cover changes. Then, using the artificial neural network FLUS module, we calculated the relationships between land classes and associated drivers and estimated the probability of occurrence of each land class.

Deforestation has a significant impact on the environment, accelerating global warming and causing irreversible damage to ecosystems. Large-scale deforestation monitoring techniques still mostly rely on statistical approaches and traditional machine learning models applied to multi-spectral, optical satellite imagery and meta-data like land cover maps. However, clouds often obstruct observations of land in optical satellite imagery, especially in the tropics, which limits their effectiveness. Moreover, statistical approaches and traditional machine learning methods may not capture the wide range of underlying distributions in deforestation data due to limited model capacity. To overcome these drawbacks, we apply an attention-based neural network architecture that learns to detect deforestation end-to-end from time series of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. Sentinel-1 C-Band SAR data are mostly independent of the weather conditions and our trained neural network model generalizes across a wide range of deforestation patterns of Amazon forests. We curate a new dataset, called BraDD-S1TS, comprising approximately 25,000 image sequences for deforested and unchanged land throughout the Brazilian Amazon. We experimentally evaluate our method on this dataset and compare it to state-of-the-art approaches. We find it outperforms still-in-use methods by 13.7 percentage points in intersection over union (IoU).

Deforestation is considered one of the main causes of global warming and biodiversity reduction. Therefore, early detection of deforestation processes is of paramount importance to preserve environmental resources. Currently, there is plenty of research focused on detecting deforestation from satellite imagery using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Although these works yield remarkable results, most of them employ pairs of images and detect changes which occurred between the two image acquisition epochs only. Furthermore, these models tend to produce poor results when applied to new data in real-world scenarios. In this regard, an interesting research topic deals with the generalization capacity of the classifiers. CNN-based approaches combined with time series data can be a suitable framework to obtain classifiers that generalize better to new data. Image time series contain complementary information, representing different imaging conditions over time. This work addresses the transferability for detecting deforestation in different areas of the Amazon region, using Sentinel-2 time series and reference maps from PRODES project, which are not required to be synchronized.

In this study, two methods that are commonly used to solve complexity issues— “top-down” system dynamics and “bottom-up” cellular automata—were combined to investigate the land use evolutionary trend in Ya’an City. Firstly, a system dynamics model of land resource use was constructed based on the causal relationship between land and macroscopic elements, and the quantitative future predictions of land use structures in Ya’an were obtained. Next, an ANN-CA model containing three steps—artificial neural network training, optimization of cellular automata parameters, and model calibration—was constructed.

Finally, the spatial layout of land use in Ya’an City in 2028 and 2038 was predicted, and the land use evolution trend was studied using the model under the constraint of the quantitative prediction results of system dynamics. The results demonstrated the good simulation effect of the ANN-CA model under the SD constraint.

Furthermore, the comprehensive driving factors were selected, including terrain factors (height and slope) and social factors (economic and population density). Then, the CA-Markov model was constructed to predict the land-use development trend in Panzhihua City after ten years. Compared with the traditional methods, experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model can improve the model's automatic interpretation ability and prediction accuracy with an increase of 24.6% in the FoM index and 4.37% in the Kappa coefficient.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/isprs-archives-xlviii-m-3-2023-279-2023,"",,

Flood risk assessment is crucial task for disaster management activities in flood-prone areas. In this study, we proposed a flood risk assessment framework that combines flood vulnerability, hazard, and damages under long-term LULC changes in the Tajan watershed, northern Iran. The research analyzed historical land use change trends and predicted changes up to 2040 by employing GIS, remote sensing, and land change modeling. The flood vulnerability map was generated using the Random Forest model, incorporating historical data from 332 flooded locations and 12 geophysical and anthropogenic flood factors under LULC change scenarios. The potential flood damage costs in residential and agricultural areas, considering long-term LULC changes, were calculated using the HEC-RAS hydraulic model and a global damage function. Results revealed that unplanned urban growth, agricultural expansion, and deforestation near the river downstream amplify flood risk in 2040. High and very high flood vulnerability areas would increase by 43% in 2040 due to human activities and LULC changes. Estimated annual flood damage for agriculture and built-up areas was projected to surge from $162 million to $376 million and $91 million to $220 million, respectively, considering 2021 and 2040 land use change scenarios in the flood-prone region. The research highlights the importance of land use planning in mitigating flood-associated risks, both in the studied area and other flood-prone regions.","",https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-3632802/v1,"",,
rayyan-220227879,Assessing land use following tropical deforestation : Combining remote sensing and deep learning,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Forests are home to a vast variety species of plants and animals.They provide these species with vital ecosystem services such as fresh air, food, nutrients, and shade, essential for survival.They also help moderate the flow of freshwater and influence precipitation patterns on which humans depend for agriculture.Forests are also fundamental for removing carbon from the atmosphere through photosynthesis, and clearing them can also result in the emission of large amounts of carbon into the atmosphere.Thus, the protection and management of these forests are critical to maintaining a continual flow of these ecosystem services and supporting life on Earth.However, over the centuries, forests have been facing threats from human activities.About 50% of the Earth's land was covered with forests a thousand decades ago, half of which have since been cleared.Today, less than 33% of the remaining forests are still intact, mostly due to deforestation and degradation.Despite the world's government's commitment to reduce or end forest loss, the trend is still increasing, specifically in the tropics, which holds 45% of the existing forest and nearly 50% of the Earth's biodiversity.The conversion of forests for food crops, commodity crops, mining, charcoal, and the need for building materials has been identified as the main leading driver of forest loss.A growing world population and increasing demand for agricultural products, especially those of commodity crops, are expected to increase demand for agricultural land and put additional pressure on forests, while changing climate patterns will aggravate this by affecting food production.Several actions, including improving farming practices (e.g.intensification), and buying only sustainable agricultural products, have been proposed to reduce pressure on forests.However, before any action is taken, the assessment of the origin, location and extent of forest loss and what drives it need to be identified.","",https://doi.org/10.18174/583842,"",,

Cellular automata based on artificial neural network (CA-ANN) along QGIS plugin module of Land Use Change Simulations (MOLUSCE) was used for predicting year 2050 land use, with a kappa value of 0.83.

Nypa palm ( Nypa fruticans ) has emerged as the predominant invasive species in the Niger Delta region of Nigeria. While endemic mangroves have high rates of carbon sequestration, stabilize coastlines and protect biodiversity, Nypa does not provide these services outside its native region of Southeast Asia. Oil exploration and urbanization in this region also exacerbate mangrove loss and Nypa spread. As Nypa is difficult to distinguish from endemic mangrove species in remotely sensed data, estimates of mangrove and ecosystem services losses in Nigeria are highly uncertain. Here, we analyse multisensor satellite data with machine learning to quantify the rapid expansion of Nypa from 2015 to 2020 in Nigeria. Using Landsat imagery and random forest classification, we quantify total potential Nypa extent in Nigeria in 2019. We then produced a Nypa extent map using iterative combinations of Sentinel‐1 SAR, Sentinel‐2 MSI and ALOS PALSAR. Random forest classifications using SAR data from ALOS and Sentinel‐1 were best suited for mapping Nypa extent with similar accuracies (78% and 75%, respectively). Based on data availability and accuracy, we focussed our change analysis on Sentinel‐1 SAR. Our results show ~28 000 ha of mangroves were converted to Nypa in Nigeria by 2020 and covered a larger extent than endemic mangroves, compounding the effect of the existing degradation and deforestation in the region. We also compared forest height and complexity estimates from Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation LiDAR to further distinguish between endemic mangroves and Nypa in three dimensions. Nypa structural variability, measured by top‐of‐canopy height, vegetation cover, plant area index, and foliage height diversity, was lower than that of mangroves. At current rates of Nypa expansion, the entire area of study would be invaded by Nypa by 2028, with potentially detrimental consequences to the ecosystem services provided by mangroves.","",https://doi.org/10.1002/rse2.353,"",,

Using LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) technology allows large amounts of forest measurements data to be obtained, such as size of volume, biomass, canopy cover, heights, among others. It also allows to quantify some damage caused by forest fires by comparing LiDAR data point clouds at two different times (before and after fire). By correlating in situ measurements with statistical parameters from point clouds, we aim to evaluate postfire deviations in volume, biomass and canopy integrity. The aim of this study was to estimate the losses caused by the 2012 wildfire in the Public Utility Forest No.82 ""Sierra de los Donceles"" (Hellín, Albacete, Spain), which devastated more than 5000 ha. We used 65 plots from the 4th National Forest Inventory (NFI4) and the LiDAR data from 2009 to develop statistical models and train Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). Another independent set of 29 plots (of 14.1-m radius with sub-metric GPS) was employed to validate the regression and ANN models. The regression results showed better performance for estimating heights (R2 = 75.03%, RMSE = 28.90%), volume (R2 = 70.32%, RMSE = 37.61%) and basal area (R2 = 68.37%, RMSE = 37.18). The total biomass showed the best fit (R2 = 93.51%), but also the maximum error (RMSE = 40.08%). The worst fit result was the estimation of number of trees per hectare (R2 = 33.76%, RMSE = 30.97%). All the models were improved with neural network implementation: number of trees per hectare (R2 = 44.41%, RMSE = 26.74%), basal area (R2 = 68.81%, RMSE = 33.49%), dominant height (R2 = 75.55%, RMSE = 15.43%), volume (R2 = 61.03%, RMSE = 14.78%) and biomass (R2 = 99.21%, RMSE = 20.81%). With our top-performing models in the 2009- and 2016-point cloud data, we measured forest reductions in terms of trees per hectare, basal area, predominant height, volume and biomass. These models provided a comprehensive view of forest losses by highlighting major decreases in vegetation coverage, tree density and tree heights.","",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rsase.2023.101114,"",,
rayyan-220227950,Climate model projections of aridity patterns in Türkiye: A comprehensive analysis using <scp>CMIP6</scp> models and three aridity indices,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract Climate change can alter the spatial and temporal distribution of aridity around the world through a combination of factors such as reduced precipitation, rising temperatures and decreased evapotranspiration. Especially the Mediterranean region has been identified as vulnerable to anthropogenic climate change due to a significant reduction in precipitation compared to other land regions in all climate models operated under different scenarios. Despite numerous studies on aridity trends, few have focused specifically on Türkiye and considered a comprehensive range of aridity indices and scenarios. This study aims to fill this research gap by providing a more detailed understanding of future aridity trends in Türkiye under various climate change scenarios and using multiple aridity indices. A novelty of this study lies in the simultaneous examination of three aridity indices (PCI, EAI and UNEP AI) for Türkiye, allowing for a more comprehensive assessment of future aridity trends. Furthermore, this study considers three future time periods (2011–2040, 2041–2070 and 2071–2100) and three shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs) to evaluate the potential range of climate change impacts on aridity in Türkiye. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to determine the changes in aridity conditions in Türkiye until the end of the 21st century. We used three aridity indices: the Pinna combinative index, the Erinç aridity index and the UNEP aridity index. These indices were calculated for the baseline period of 1981–2010 using gridded data (CHELSA) and for the periods of 2011–2040, 2041–2070 and 2071–2100 using three climate models (GFDL‐ESM4, MRI‐ESM2‐0 and IPSL‐CM6A‐LR) and multi‐model means with three SSPs to represent different future scenarios. The results showed that all three indices indicate an increase in dry climate conditions in Türkiye after 2041, with particularly notable increases expected in Central Anatolia, Southeastern Anatolia and parts of the Eastern Mediterranean, as well as eastern parts of Eastern Anatolia and the inner Aegean region. Under the SSP3‐7.0 scenario, the expansion of semi‐arid and arid areas is predicted to cover more than 30% of the country by the end of the century (2071–2100). This increase in aridity could increase the region's vulnerability to climate change and the risk of desertification, which should be taken into consideration in national water management and planning.","",https://doi.org/10.1002/joc.8201,"",,

However, a clear technical definition of the land cover class is a prerequisite for learning and applying a machine learning model. One of the challenging classes is naturalness and human influence, yet mapping it is important due to its critical role in biodiversity conservation, habitat assessment, and climate change monitoring. We present an interpretable machine learning approach to map patterns related to territorial protected and anthropogenic areas as proxies of naturalness and human influence using satellite imagery. To achieve this, we train a weakly-supervised convolutional neural network and subsequently apply attribution methods such as Grad-CAM and occlusion sensitivity mapping. We propose a novel network architecture that consists of an image-to-image network and a shallow, task-specific head. Both sub-networks are connected by an intermediate layer that captures high-level features in full resolution, allowing for detailed analysis with a wide range of attribution methods. We further analyze how intermediate layer activations relate to their attributions across the training dataset to establish a consistent relationship. This makes attributions consistent across different scenes and allows for a large-scale analysis of remote sensing data. The results highlight that our approach is a promising way to observe and assess naturalness and territorial protection.","",https://doi.org/10.3389/frai.2023.1278118,"",,
rayyan-220227960,Strictly Enforcing Invertibility and Conservation in CNN-Based Super Resolution for Scientific Datasets,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract Recently, deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have revolutionized image “super resolution” (SR), dramatically outperforming past methods for enhancing image resolution. They could be a boon for the many scientific fields that involve imaging or any regularly gridded datasets: satellite remote sensing, radar meteorology, medical imaging, numerical modeling, and so on. Unfortunately, while SR-CNNs produce visually compelling results, they do not necessarily conserve physical quantities between their low-resolution inputs and high-resolution outputs when applied to scientific datasets. Here, a method for “downsampling enforcement” in SR-CNNs is proposed. A differentiable operator is derived that, when applied as the final transfer function of a CNN, ensures the high-resolution outputs exactly reproduce the low-resolution inputs under 2D-average downsampling while improving performance of the SR schemes. The method is demonstrated across seven modern CNN-based SR schemes on several benchmark image datasets, and applications to weather radar, satellite imager, and climate model data are shown. The approach improves training time and performance while ensuring physical consistency between the super-resolved and low-resolution data. Significance Statement Recent advancements in using deep learning to increase the resolution of images have substantial potential across the many scientific fields that use images and image-like data. Most image super-resolution research has focused on the visual quality of outputs, however, and is not necessarily well suited for use with scientific data where known physics constraints may need to be enforced. Here, we introduce a method to modify existing deep neural network architectures so that they strictly conserve physical quantities in the input field when “super resolving” scientific data and find that the method can improve performance across a wide range of datasets and neural networks. Integration of known physics and adherence to established physical constraints into deep neural networks will be a critical step before their potential can be fully realized in the physical sciences.","",https://doi.org/10.1175/aies-d-21-0012.1,"",,

The introduction of trees into grasslands and shrublands causes large‐scale changes in ecosystem structure and function, which have cascading impacts on ecosystem services, biodiversity, and agricultural economies. Satellites are increasingly being used to track tree cover at continental to global scales, but these methods can only provide reliable estimates of change over recent decades. Given the slow pace of tree cover expansion, remote sensing techniques that can extend this historical record provide critical insights into the magnitude of environmental change. Here, we estimate conifer expansion in rangelands of the northern Great Plains, United States, North America, using historical aerial imagery from the mid‐20th century and modern aerial imagery. We analyzed 19.3 million hectares of rangelands in Montana, USA, using a convolutional neural network (U‐Net architecture) and cloud computing to detect tree features and tree cover change. Our bias‐corrected results estimate 3.0 ± 0.2 million hectares of conifer tree cover expansion in Montana rangelands, which accounts for 15.4% of the total study area. Overall accuracy was &gt;91%, but the producer's accuracy was lower than the user's accuracy (0.60 vs. 0.88) for areas of tree cover expansion. Nonetheless, the omission errors were not spatially clustered, suggesting that the method is reliable for identifying the regions of Montana where substantial tree expansion has occurred. Using the model results in conjunction with historical and modern imagery allows for effective communication of the scale of tree expansion while overcoming the recency effect caused by shifting environmental baselines.","",https://doi.org/10.1002/rse2.357,"",,

Conservation policies, on the other hand, have existed or are being implemented in these forests since 2002 to prevent deforestation. There is, however, the question on how effective were the conservation policies in preventing forest loss. The goal of this study was to analyze the effect of conservation policies in preventing forest loss, as well as to forecast their future effectiveness. Since the spatio-temporal changes in forest cover, land-use and its patterns occur in a non-linear way, this study was based on the use of Land Transformation Model (LTM). Using geographic information systems (GIS) and artificial neural networks (ANNs), this model forecasts future forest changes for the next 30 years. Three scenarios were used for this purpose, in which the input patterns included the years 2002-2012, 2002-2022, and 2012-2022. Based on these, deforestation was predicted for the next three decades using 14 variables. Assuming no changes in the implementation of conservation policies in the Zagros forests, the model was characterized by a consistent accuracy and indicated a projected pattern of increased deforestation over the next years in the region. In other words, by the ongoing conservation policies, the net deforestation overtakes net reforestation. It appears that to stop further forest degradation, Iran's Forestry Service decision-makers must implement improved forest conservation policies.","",https://doi.org/10.15287/afr.2023.2628,"",,

The balance between food security and energy security is a national issue of extreme importance. A more stable supply of electricity could be achieved as solar farms expand but at the expense of losing some of the prime agricultural lands which endangers availability of sufficient agricultural produce. This study aims to use ANN-Cellular Automata (CA) via the Geographic Information System (GIS) platform and remote sensing (RS) data to assess the impact of cropland transition to solar farms and other land use/land cover (LULC). Several remotely sensed data were processed including MODIS land cover data (MCD12Q1), VIIRS nighttime lights (VNL v2.1), Advanced Himawari Imager Shortwave Radiation (AHI-SWR) product, and population density (LandScan) as inputs to the Cellular Automata-Artificial Neural Network (CA-ANN) model to simulate LULC changes in Tarlac Province, Philippines via the Modules for Land Use Change Evaluation (MOLUSCE) plugin in QGIS. For years 2019, 2023 and 2027 with 2015 as the base year, results showed an increasing trend for savannas and grassland with ΔLULC values of +11.4% to +15.1% and +0.2% to 3.5%, respectively. Meanwhile, a decreasing trend is observed for built-up/water, forest, and cropland with ΔLULC values of −3.0% to −6.3%, −8.5% to −21.1%, and −3.9% to −4.2%, respectively. Results also showed a conversion of a 100-ha area of croplands to solar farm from year 2019 to 2023 which translates to an estimated monetary loss from agricultural produce due to solar farm conversion amounting to Php 7,584,720.00 (~USD 138,000) which is equivalent to the total average annual income of about 67 families in Tarlac. Lastly, the simulated 2027 LULC map showed pixels with unrealistic conversions from solar farm (year 2023) to cropland (year 2027). To improve the model, it is recommended to add more spatial data to effectively capture factors that may contribute to the expansion of solar farms in the future. Moreover, high resolution LULC maps (vector maps if available) can be used instead of a course resolution satellite-derived raster data. Nonetheless, this study has demonstrated the use of RS, GIS and machine learning techniques to model cropland conversion to solar farms and other LULC classes. Results from this study can provide scientific data to policy makers, solar industry players and other relevant stakeholders in doing technoeconomic assessment of solar farm development and expansion considering its effect on energy security and food security towards national sustainable development.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/isprs-archives-xlviii-m-1-2023-255-2023,"",,

Reliable and highly resolved data on the state of and change in biodiversity and species distributions are critical for effective measures. However, high‐resolution maps of fish distribution remain limited for large riverine systems. Coupling data from global satellite sensors with broad‐scale environmental DNA (eDNA) and machine learning could enable rapid and precise mapping of the distribution of river organisms. Here, we investigated the potential for combining these methods using a fish eDNA dataset from 110 sites sampled along the full length of the Rhone River in Switzerland and France. Using Sentinel 2 and Landsat 8 images, we generated a set of ecological variables describing both the aquatic and the terrestrial habitats surrounding the river corridor. We combined these variables with eDNA‐based presence and absence data on 29 fish species and used three machine‐learning models to assess environmental suitability for these species. Most models showed good performance, indicating that ecological variables derived from remote sensing can approximate the ecological determinants of fish species distributions, but water‐derived variables had stronger associations than the terrestrial variables surrounding the river. The species range mapping indicated a significant transition in the species occupancy along the Rhone, from its source in the Swiss Alps to outlet into the Mediterranean Sea in southern France. Our study demonstrates the feasibility of combining remote sensing and eDNA to map species distributions in a large river.

Population migration to the new capital may pose a food security challenge. To address this fundamental issue, one of the most crucial approaches is to establish buffer areas that can support the food needs of the new capital. The currently existing official Area Sampling Frame survey conducted by the government to assess food vulnerability faced several limitations, including weather conditions, field terrain variations, and high cost. In this study, we propose the utilization of remote sensing satellite imagery data in buffer areas to analyze changes and predict future land cover, which can provide valuable data for assessing food availability. We investigate the integration of a Cellular Automata method with the two most popular analytical methods of classical Logistic Regression and data-driven Artificial Neural Networks, known as CA-LR and CA-ANN, to identify and map land cover changes in the new capital buffer zones. Our findings reveal that both combined methods, CA-LR and CA-ANN, yield fairly promising results, with correctness and kappa statistic values exceeding 80%. Prediction results indicate that buffer areas are predominantly covered by trees, while built-up areas are still limited. The flooded vegetation cover, including rice fields, is predicted to decrease by 2024. This should be a matter of concern for stakeholders, considering the construction of the new capital city is still ongoing and the number of migrants is expected to keep rising.","",https://doi.org/10.34123/icdsos.v2023i1.338,"",,

Irrigation, as a hydrological artificial process, has an indispensable role in achieving that goal. However, high pressure and demand on water resources could lead to serious problems in water consumption. Knowing information about the spatial distribution of irrigation parcels is essential to many aspects of Earth system science and global change research. To extract this knowledge for the main agricultural region in Serbia located in the moderate continental area, we utilized optical satellite Sentinel-2 data and collected ground truth data needed to train the machine learning model. Both satellite imagery and ground truth data were collected for the three most irrigated crops, maize, soybean, and sugar beet during 3 years (2020–2022) characterized by different weather conditions. This data was then used for training the Random Forest-based models, separately for each crop type, differentiating irrigated and rainfed crops on the parcel level. Finally, the models were run for the whole territory of Vojvodina generating 10 m resolution maps of irrigated three crops of interest. With overall accuracy for crops per year (2020: 0.76; 2021: 0.78; 2022: 0.84) results showed that this method could be successfully used for detecting the irrigation of three crops of interest. This was confirmed by validation with the national dataset from Public Water Management Company ""Vode Vojvodine"" which revealed that classification maps had an accuracy of 76%. These maps further allow us to understand the spatial dynamics of the most important irrigated crops and can serve for the improvement of sustainable agricultural water management.","",https://doi.org/10.1080/15481603.2023.2262010,"",,

Therefore, near real-time mapping of natural hazards is an emerging priority for the support of natural disaster relief, risk management, and informed governmental policy decisions. Current remote sensing based approaches to near real-time natural hazard mapping increasingly leverage advantage of deep learning (DL). Nevertheless, DL-based approaches are mainly designed for one specific task in a single geographic region based on specific frequency bands of satellite data. For that reason, DL models used to map specific natural hazards struggle with their generalization to other types of natural hazards in unseen regions. In this work, we propose a methodology to significantly improve the generalizability of DL natural hazards mappers based on pre-training on a suitable pre-task. Without access to any data from the target domain, we demonstrate that this methodology improved generalizability across four U-Net architectures for the segmentation of unseen natural hazards, such as flood events, landslides, and massive glacier collapses. Importantly, our method is strongly invariant to geographic differences and the type of input frequency bands of satellite data. That is confirmed by obtaining a balanced accuracy of up to 0.74 in comparison with performance of reference baselines. By leveraging characteristics of unlabeled images from the target domain that are publicly available, our approach is able to further improve the generalization behavior of DL models without fine-tuning. That is reflected in performance metrics. Thereby, our approach is one of first attempts to support the development of foundation models for earth monitoring with the objective of directly segmenting unseen natural hazards across novel geographic regions from different sources of satellite imagery.","",https://doi.org/10.1109/igarss52108.2023.10282643,"",,

In this study, three different diversity indices (Simpson (λ), Shannon (H'), and Pielou (J')), were tested to characterize forest tree species diversity using individual monthly and multi-temporal Sentinel-1 and -2 images during 2021. The performance of three different machine learning models, Random Forest (RF), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), and Deep Neural Network (DNN) were tested. A collection of 1,020 plot measurements (comprising 47 tree species and 28,122 trees), randomly collected in a mixed broadleaf-conifer forest area in northeast China, was used to train (n = 816) and validate (n = 204) the models. The models dependent on multi-temporal Sentinel-1/2 imagery were found to outperform the models based on individual monthly data, in predicting forest tree species diversity, with average accuracies of 78% for H', 77% for λ and 77% for J'. The use of DNN performed marginally better than the XGB and RF models, with accuracies of 81% for H', 80% for λ and 79% for J', respectively. Finally, a boosted regression model, involving environmental variable predictors and the DNN-based estimated tree species diversity, showed that on average 63 ± 4% of the spatial variations of tree species diversity was explained by environmental variables, including annual temperature (29.30%), followed by soil fertility (27.03%), snow cover (13.63%) and a digital elevation model (12.33%). Our results highlight that an empirical approach based on machine learning and multi-temporal Sentinel-1/2 data can adequately predict forest tree species diversity and we further show the important roles of air temperature and soil fertility in governing the spatial variability of tree species diversity in a mixed broadleaf-conifer forest setting.","",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.srs.2023.100094,"",,

The current wetland mapping techniques in Norway are tedious and costly, and remote sensing provides an opportunity for large-scale mapping and ecosystem accounting. We aimed to implement a deep learning approach to mapping wetlands with Sentinel-2 and LiDAR data over southern Norway. Our U-Net model, implemented through Google Earth Engine and TensorFlow, produced a wetland map with a balanced accuracy rate of 90.9% when validated against an independent ground-truth sample. This represents an improvement upon manually digitized land cover maps in Norway, which achieved accuracy rates of 46.8% (1:50,000 map) and 42.4% (1:5000 map). Using our map, we estimated a total wetland coverage area of 12.7% in southern Norway, which is double the previous benchmark estimates (5.6%). We followed an iterative model training and evaluation approach, which revealed that increasing the quantity and coverage of labeled wetlands greatly increases the model performance. We highlight the potential of satellite-based wetland maps for the ecosystem accounting of changes in wetland extents over time—something that is not feasible with traditional mapping methods.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/rs15051203,"",,

This is due to different factors, among which climate change and land use stand out. In Mexico, they occur every year in different areas. Tabasco is a periodically flooded region, causing losses and negative consequences for the rural, urban, livestock, agricultural, and service industries. Consequently, it is necessary to create strategies to intervene effectively in the affected areas. Different strategies and techniques have been developed to mitigate the damage caused by this phenomenon. Satellite programs provide a large amount of data on the Earth’s surface and geospatial information processing tools useful for environmental and forest monitoring, climate change impacts, risk analysis, and natural disasters. This paper presents a strategy for the classification of flooded areas using satellite images obtained from synthetic aperture radar, as well as the U-Net neural network and ArcGIS platform. The study area is located in Los Rios, a region of Tabasco, Mexico. The results show that U-Net performs well despite the limited number of training samples.

Droughts in Thailand are becoming more severe due to climate change. Developing a reliable drought monitoring and early warning system (DMEWS) is essential to strengthen a country's resilience to droughts. However, for a DMEWS to be valuable, the drought indicators provided to stakeholders must have relevance to tangible impacts on the ground. Here, we analyse drought indicator-to-impact relationships in Thailand, using a combination of correlation analysis and machine learning techniques (random forest). In the correlation analysis, we study the link between meteorological drought indicators and high-resolution remote sensing vegetation indices used as proxies for crop yield and forest growth impacts. Our analysis shows that this link varies depending on land use, season and region. The random forest models built to estimate regional crop productivity allow a more in-depth analysis of the crop- and region-specific importance of different drought indicators. The results highlight seasonal patterns of drought vulnerability for individual crops, usually linked to their growing season, although the effects are somewhat attenuated in irrigated regions. Integration of the approaches provides new, detailed knowledge of crop- and region-specific indicator-to-impact links, which can form the basis of targeted mitigation actions in an improved DMEWS in Thailand and could be applied to other parts of Southeast Asia and beyond.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-2419-2023,"",,

Despite their importance, forests continue to be lost to other land uses such as agricultural production and urban development. Advancements in remote sensing and machine learning techniques have facilitated land use/land cover (LULC) change projections, but many prior efforts have neglected to account for social and policy dimensions. We incorporated key socio-economic factors, conservation policies, societal preferences, and landscape biophysical features into LULC projection techniques under four different development scenarios. We applied this approach in the Upper Flint watershed, which flows south from the Atlanta, Georgia metropolitan area and is characterized by extensive urbanization and associated deforestation. Our results suggest that incorporating social and policy drivers in future LULC projection approaches leads to more realistic results with higher accuracy levels, offering decision-makers, development planners, and policymakers better opportunities to forecast the effects of anticipated changes on the availability of ESs in the future. Conservation organizations and public agencies can benefit from such analysis to identify regions requiring conservation interventions for prioritizing their conservation efforts. We used publicly available data for the conterminous U.S., hence our approach can be replicable in other study regions within the nation.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/su151914270,"",,

However, attributes and indicators to quantify forest resilience still need to be explored. Remote sensing (RS) and Geographical Information System (GIS) techniques are widely applied for forest resilience modeling. A bibliometric analysis was conducted to obtain insights concerning methods for quantifying forest resilience using RS/GIS. VosViewer and Bibliometrix R software were applied to analyze 117 articles from the Web of Science global database covering a period of 2011-2021. Using inclusion-exclusion criteria, 31 studies were examined, covering local, regional, and transnational ecosystem types. Satellite devices were used in 28 studies, whilst GIS dataset frameworks were used in the remaining studies. Multiple satellites and sensors were preferable to maximize results for modeling forest resilience. To estimate resilience, ecological attributes (above-ground biomass, tree-ring, and basal area increments) and remote-sensing derived indicators (vegetation indices, forest cover changes, deforestation rates, and forest productivity) were analyzed using conventional statistical tests or machine learning techniques. Studies combined experiments, observations, and process-based models demonstrated better results. Scale and resolution, indicator uncertainty, and data availability were among the constraints reported using RS/GIS. Therefore, a standardized framework for forest resilience assessment incorporating field observation with RS/GIS is needed.","",https://doi.org/10.1088/1755-1315/1266/1/012086,"",,

Temporal monitoring and predictive modeling are valuable tools for making decisions about conserving these areas and planning actions to reduce the pressure caused by activities such as agriculture. This study accordingly developed an LULC analysis framework based on open-source software (QGIS and R language) and predictive methodology using artificial neural networks in the Alvão Natural Park (PNA), a protected area in northern Portugal. The results show that in 2041, Agriculture and Open Space/Non-vegetation classes will evidence the greatest decrease, while Forest and Bushes will have expanded the most. Spatially, the areas to the west and northeast of the protected area will experience the most significant changes. The relationship of land use classes with data from the climate model HadGEM3-GC31-LL (CMIP6) utilizing scenarios RCP 4.5 and 8.5 demonstrates how through the period 2041–2060 there is a tendency for increased precipitation, which when combined with the dynamics of a retraction in classes such as agriculture, favors the advancement of natural classes such as bushes and forest; however, the subsequent climate data period (2061–2080) projects a decrease in precipitation volumes and an increase in the minimum and maximum temperatures, defining a new pattern with an extension of the period of drought and precipitation being concentrated in a short period of the year, which may result in a greater recurrence of extreme events, such as prolonged droughts that result in water shortages and fires.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/land12071302,"",,

These maps feature distinct symbols representing various land cover types, such as forests and wetlands, offering a unique historical perspective on land-use changes. For example, there has been a significant reduction in wetlands because of agricultural expansion and intensification which lead to biodiversity loss and increased greenhouse gas emissions globally. Our study uses U-net CNN to automatically segment wetland symbols from nineteenth century maps from hundreds of map sheets for an area of interest a large river catchment in Ireland. Extracted wetland extents were intersected with digital land cover datasets to estimate current land cover on former wetland (on both organic and mineral soils). Utilizing U-Net, we successfully automated the segmentation of wetland symbols from hundreds of nineteenth-century map sheets, focusing on a large river catchment area in Ireland. Our analysis achieved a very high F1 score of 98.2% and a Kappa of 89%. While it is challenging to verify the veracity of historical map content, the largely untapped information contained within these maps are important for understanding landscape change over time, and especially before the era of Earth observation & remote sensing.

The detection targets were mature fruits mainly covered with two kinds of sun protection materials—round plastic covers and nets—which could be used to predict the yield in the next two to three months. For round plastic covers (hereafter referred to as wearing a hat), the Faster R-CNN was used to locate and count the number of mature fruits based on input image tiles with a size of 256 × 256 pixels. In the case of intersection-over-union (IoU) &gt; 0.5, the F1-score of the hat wearer detection results was 0.849, the average precision (AP) was 0.739, the precision was 0.990, and the recall was 0.743.

Conclusion:The object-oriented U-net deep learning method has a favorable classification performance, and its accuracy is significantly higher than other methods in our study.The selection of optimal feature combination is the key to improving the extraction efficiency of coastal wetland plant species information.Our study could provide references for fine classification of coastal wetland plant species, as well as monitoring and biodiversity conservation management of coastal wetlands.","",https://doi.org/10.17520/biods.2022411,"",,

Moderate rodent population activities positively improve soil permeability, promote nutrient cycling, and promote biodiversity. However, too much rodent population or excessive activity intensity will bring negative effects on the ecological environment. Therefore, it is of great significance to accurately grasp the rodent activity intensity (RAI) in alpine grassland to cope with the changes in rodent populations and maintain the stability of the alpine grassland ecosystem. The Zoige alpine grassland was used as the study area in this study. In addition, UAV was sent to sample the rodent activity area in the alpine grassland. With the aid of field survey data, the surface information of rodent activity in the experimental area was identified, and the RAI index in the sample plot was calculated. Then, based on Sentinel-2A satellite remote sensing multi-spectral data and spectral index, multiple linear regression (MLR), multi-layer perceptron neural networks (MPL neural nets), random forest (RF), and support vector regression (SVR) were used to construct four models for RAI and Sentinel-2 datasets. The accuracy of the four models was compared and analyzed. The results showed that the RF model had the highest prediction accuracy (R2 = 0.8263, RWI = 0.8210, LCCC = 0.8916, RMSE = 0.0840, MAE = 0.0549), followed by the SVR model, the MLP neural nets model, and the MLR model. Overall, the nonlinear relationship between rodent activity intensity and satellite remote sensing images is obvious. Machine learning with strong nonlinear fitting ability can better characterize the RAI in alpine grassland.

The presented analysis focused on randomly selected rapidly growing settlements in the Prague metropolitan area, examining their development with a focus on the peripheral parts of such settlements. Settlement margins constitute a specific part of rural settlements as it typically contributes to the rural character by providing the gradual gradient between the settlement and the open landscape. The representation of water-absorbing and non-water-absorbing areas and their suitability for the development of taller vegetation along the margins of three randomly selected suburbanised settlements in the hinterland of Prague are analysed from the perspective of the possibility to maintain the traditional character of the settlement margins. Historical maps, aerial photographs, spatial planning documents, and data on current land use and landscape cover were used for the analysis of the settlements’ development over the last approx. 200 years. In order to determine whether an area is water absorbing or not, a manual approach was used for historical maps and a machine learning process for present orthophoto maps. The automated machine learning classification process could be utilised, because the used orthophoto imagery includes a near-infrared portion of the spectrum (i.e. NIR imagery). We have observed the trend of decreasing plot size and of reduction in the water-absorbing surfaces suitable for planting taller vegetation, especially in the twenty-first century residential developments, which disrupts the traditional rural character of these settlements. The utilisation and stabilisation of the current vegetation in the historical areas, together with the creation of the vegetation belts along the margins of the newly developed areas, could improve the environmental quality of these settlements, promote ecosystem services, and increase biodiversity.","",https://doi.org/10.1007/s10668-023-03554-w,"",,

This study aimed to determine the spatial-temporal dynamics of land use change in 2012-2022 and predict future land use change using the ANN-CA model for 20 years (2022-2042). Analyzed the spatial-temporal dynamics of land use change based on land use data derived from SPOT imagery, then predicted future land use change with the ANN-CA model using the MOLUSCE plugin on QGIS Desktop 2.18.11. The simulation results showed an accuracy of 86.66% and an overall Kappa value of 83% obtained by comparing the actual data in 2022 with the simulated data on land use change in the same year. The irrigated paddy fields decreased by 6.39% (685.22 ha) due to conversion to settlements. The area of residential buildings increased by 4.65% (498.49 ha) during 2012- 2017.

The statistical analyses of remote sensing climate variables (i.e., evapotranspiration, specific humidity, soil temperature, air temperature, precipitation, soil moisture) and remote sensing and ground-truth lake level applied to the period 1993–2012 reveal that remote sensing data has a skewed distribution; ground-truth data has a symmetrical distribution. Linear Regression (LR), Support Vector Regression (SVR), Regression Tree (RT), Random Forest Regression (RF), and Deep Learning (DL) methods show that (i) RF and LR, with the highest R2 and EVS and least MAE, MSE, RMSE and, CVMSE values seem the best models to further investigate remote sensing and ground-truth lake level data and (ii) the remote sensing data based models outperform the ground-truth data based models based on their MAE, MSE, RMSE, and CVMSE values. The most useful variables to predict lake level are precipitation and air temperature. The data analysis methodology reported here is of fundamental importance for the perspectives of an integrated and forward-looking water management system for connecting climate change, vulnerability, and human activities in the Lake Chad human-environment system.

In this paper, we use LULC maps and explanatory variables aggregated in five dimensions (physical/natural, economic, sociocultural, technological, and demographic) to identify which are the main drinving forces in the evolution process and the simulation of LULC dynamics for 2036, using as a case study the Chapecó River ecological corridor (Chapecó EC) area. The Chapecó EC was created by the state government in 2010 with the goal of combining nature conservation with local and regional development. In this region, in the last two decades, the loss of areas of natural grassland and forest was on average five times higher than the average recorded in the state. Based on scenario-building methods using artificial neural networks, six predictive scenarios were elaborated, based on three socioeconomic scenarios (current conditions, growth, and socioeconomic recession) and two territorial intervention options (actions). This includes an action based on maintaining the current LULC, and another action of a conservationist nature with the recovery of forest and natural grassland areas to the proportions of areas found in 1990. The results indicate that if the current LULC is maintained, forest, pasture and agriculture areas tend to increase, while silviculture and natural grassland areas decrease, driven by economic and physical/natural driving forces. If there is a conservationist action, natural grassland and pasture areas tend to increase and silviculture and agriculture tend to lose area due to economic, technological, and physical/natural driving forces. These trends have revealed that the natural grassland preservation/restoration, the encouragement of conservationist agricultural practices combined with economic strategies, and the technological development of the rural sector seem to form the basis of economic development combined with biodiversity conservation.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/land12010181,"",,

We used satellite and aerial imagery coupled with machine learning classification to map the use of hedgerows/windbreaks and winter cover crops in California's Central Coast, a globally important agricultural area of intensive fresh produce production. We expected that adoption of both practices would be relatively low and unevenly distributed across the landscape, with higher levels of adoption found in marginal farmland and in less intensively cultivated areas where the pressure to remove non-crop vegetation may be lower. Our remote sensing classification revealed that only ~6% of farmland had winter cover crops in 2021 and 0.26% of farmland had hedgerows or windbreaks in 2018. Thirty-seven percent of ranch parcels had cover crops on at least 5% of the ranch while 22% of ranches had at least one hedgerow/windbreak. Nearly 16% of farmland had other annual winter crops, some of which could provide services similar to cover crops; however, 60% of farmland had bare soil over the winter study period, with the remainder of farmland classified as perennial crops or strawberries. Hotspot analysis showed significant areas of adoption of both practices in the hillier regions of all counties. Finally, qualitative interviews revealed that adoption patterns were likely driven by interrelated effects of topography, land values, and farming models, with organic, diversified farms implementing these practices in less ideal, lower-value farmland. This study demonstrates how remote sensing coupled with qualitative research can be used to map and interpret patterns of important diversification practices, with implications for tracking policy interventions and targeting resources to assist farmers motivated to expand adoption.","",https://doi.org/10.3389/fsufs.2023.1052029,"",,
rayyan-220228539,Investigating Permafrost Carbon Dynamics in Alaska with Artificial Intelligence,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"It is well-established that positive feedbacks between permafrost degradation and the release of soil carbon into the atmosphere impacts land-atmosphere interactions, disrupts the global carbon cycle, and accelerates climate change. The widespread distribution of thawing permafrost is causing a cascade of geophysical and biochemical disturbances with global impact. Currently, few earth system models account for permafrost carbon feedback mechanisms. This research identifies, interprets, and explains the feedback sensitivities attributed to permafrost degradation and terrestrial carbon cycling imbalance with in-situ and flux tower measurements, remote sensing observations, process-based modeling simulations, and deep learning architecture. We defined and formulated high-resolution polymodal datasets with multitemporal extents and hyperspatiospectral fidelity (i.e., 12.4 million parameters with 13.1 million in situ data points, 2.84 billion ground-controlled remotely sensed data points, and 36.58 million model-based simulation outputs to computationally reflect the state space of the earth system), simulated the non-linear feedback mechanisms attributed to permafrost degradation and carbon cycle perturbation across Alaska with a process-constrained deep learning architecture composed of cascading stacks of convolutionally layered memory-encoded recurrent neural networks (i.e., GeoCryoAI), and interpreted historical and future emulations of freeze-thaw dynamics and the permafrost carbon feedback with a suite of evaluation and performance metrics (e.g., cross-entropic loss, root-mean-square deviation, accuracy). This framework introduces ecological memory components and effectively learns subtle spatiotemporal covariate complexities in high-latitude ecosystems by emulating permafrost degradation and carbon flux dynamics across Alaska with high precision and minimal loss (RMSE: 1.007cm, 0.694nmolCH4m-2s-1, 0.213µmolCO2m-2s-1). This methodology and findings offer significant insight about the permafrost carbon feedback by informing scientists and the public on how climate change is accelerating, strategies to ameliorate the impact of permafrost degradation on the global carbon cycle, and to what extent these connections matter in space and time.","",https://doi.org/10.22541/essoar.170355056.64772303/v1,"",,
rayyan-220228541,Utilization of deep learning tools to map and monitor biological soil crusts,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Biological soil crusts (biocrusts) form a layer of only one to few centimeters depth on the soil surface and occur mostly in hot and cold deserts. Biocrusts have a major impact on different processes in these ecosystems, like carbon and nitrogen cycling, biodiversity preservation, erosion protection and soil dust emission reduction, but also react highly sensitive upon climate alterations and land use intensification. Therefore, monitoring tools are required to keep track of the changes of these specialized communities in an altering environment. In the current study, we applied a semantic image segmentation approach, using neural networks. One main problem to be solved was, that the training data and target data, on which the model is applied, are often recorded with different camera devices. This leads to different statistical properties of the image data, like different scale, resolution, brightness etc., which could significantly affect the model's performance. To solve this problem, we propose a new domain adaption method using a joint energy-based approach. To test a semantic segmentation approach in general, we utilized biocrust imagery taken in Utah (United States of America) and two sub datasets from the National Park Gesäuse (Austria). Here, we achieved highly reliable results with an overall classification accuracy of 85.9% for the USA data and 88.6% and 91.4%, respectively, for the two sub datasets of the National Park Gesäuse. To test our joint energy-based domain adaption approach, we used the two sub datasets from the National Park Gesäuse, which were recorded with different camera devices. With this newly established approach, we improved the accuracy of our segmentation on the unlabeled sub dataset from 70.4% to 75.3%. The results suggest that joint energy-based modelling is a well-suited domain adaption method for semantic segmentation that could be applied to face various deep learning and image-based biomonitoring challenges.","",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoinf.2023.102417,"",,
rayyan-220228579,Reducing Southern Ocean Shortwave Radiation Errors in the ERA5 Reanalysis with Machine Learning and 25 Years of Surface Observations,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract Earth system models struggle to simulate clouds and their radiative effects over the Southern Ocean, partly due to a lack of measurements and targeted cloud microphysics knowledge. We have evaluated biases of downwelling shortwave radiation in the ERA5 climate reanalysis using 25 years (1995–2019) of summertime surface measurements, collected on the Research and Supply Vessel (RSV) Aurora Australis , the Research Vessel (R/V) Investigator , and at Macquarie Island. During October–March daylight hours, the ERA5 simulation of SW down exhibited large errors (mean bias = 54 W m −2 , mean absolute error = 82 W m −2 , root-mean-square error = 132 W m −2 , and R 2 = 0.71). To determine whether we could improve these statistics, we bypassed ERA5’s radiative transfer model for SW down with machine learning–based models using a number of ERA5’s gridscale meteorological variables as predictors. These models were trained and tested with the surface measurements of SW down using a 10-fold shuffle split. An extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) and a random forest–based model setup had the best performance relative to ERA5, both with a near complete reduction of the mean bias error, a decrease in the mean absolute error and root-mean-square error by 25% ± 3%, and an increase in the R 2 value of 5% ± 1% over the 10 splits. Large improvements occurred at higher latitudes and cyclone cold sectors, where ERA5 performed most poorly. We further interpret our methods using Shapley additive explanations. Our results indicate that data-driven techniques could have an important role in simulating surface radiation fluxes and in improving reanalysis products. Significance Statement Simulating the amount of sunlight reaching Earth’s surface is difficult because it relies on a good understanding of how much clouds absorb and scatter sunlight. Relative to summertime surface observations, the ERA5 reanalysis still overestimates the amount of sunlight entering the Southern Ocean. We taught some models how to predict the amount of sunlight entering the Southern Ocean using 25 years of surface observations and a small set of meteorological variables from ERA5. By bypassing the ERA5’s internal simulation of the absorption and scattering of sunlight, we can drastically reduce biases in the predicted surface shortwave radiation. Large improvements in cold sectors of cyclones and closer to Antarctica were observed in regions where many numerical models struggle to simulate the amount of incoming sunlight correctly.","",https://doi.org/10.1175/aies-d-22-0044.1,"",,
rayyan-220228585,Mapping Large-Scale Pantropical Forest Canopy Height by Integrating GEDI Lidar and TanDEM-X InSAR Data,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract Our ability to infer the impact of land use changes such as deforestation and reforestation on concentrations of atmospheric CO 2 rests upon accurate and spatially resolved estimates of forest structure, namely canopy height, aboveground biomass (AGB) and biomass density (AGBD). Since April 2019, NASA’s Global Ecosystem Dynamic Investigation (GEDI) mission has been collecting billions of lidar waveforms over the Earth’s temperate and pantropical forests. However, GEDI is a sampling mission and there are large gaps between tracks, as well as those caused by clouds. As a result, the standard gridded height products created from this mission are at 1 km resolution which provides nearly continuous coverage, but which may be too coarse for some applications. One way to provide wall-to-wall maps at finer spatial resolution is through fusion with other remotely sensed data that are responsive to ecosystem structure. The TanDEM-X twin satellites (abbreviated as TDX for convenience all through this study) have provided an unprecedented dataset of global SAR interferometry at X-band since 2010 and have been shown to be highly sensitive to height and other ecosystem structure, but with limited accuracy as compared to lidar. Building on our previous research for fusion of TDX and GEDI, we present a new method of mapping high spatial resolution forest heights across large areas using data from these two missions. Our method uses GEDI waveforms to provide the vertical profile of scatterers needed to invert a physically-based model to solve for canopy height. We assess the impact of using profiles generalized over large areas and develop a calibration method based on GEDI canopy heights to improve model performance. Our method reduces regional errors in forest height caused by the limited penetration capability of the X-band signal in dense tropical forests and the impact of terrain slope using adaptive wavenumber ( k Z )-based calibration models and over 2 years of GEDI height observations. In comparison to applying a general country-scale calibration model, the adaptive method selects more representative calibration coefficients for different forest types and landscapes. We apply the method over the entirety of Gabon, Mexico, French Guiana and most of the Amazon basin to produce continuous forest height products at 25m and 100 m. We find that the regional calibration approach produces the best results with a bias of 0.31 m, RMSE = 8.48 m (30.02%) at 25 m and a bias of 0.46 m, RMSE = 6.91 m (24.08%) at 100 m when cross-validated against airborne lidar data. In comparison to existing height data products that have used Machine Learning based approaches to fuse GEDI with passive optical data, such as Landsat and Sentinel-2, our methods produce maps with greatly reduced bias, lower RMSE, and they do not saturate for tall canopy heights up to 56 m. An important feature of this study is that our canopy height product is complemented with an uncertainty of prediction map which is a measure of the predictor’s uncertainty around the actual value rather than the standard error (a square root of estimated variance which quantifies the predictor’s expectation) used by earlier studies. The approach outlined here shows how the integration of GEDI data with TDX InSAR images enables high-resolution mapping of wall-to-wall forest canopy heights, providing an essential foundation for the global mapping of aboveground biomass.","",https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-3306982/v1,"",,

rayyan-220228668,Effect of Socioeconomic Variables in Predicting Global Fire Ignition Occurrence,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Fires are a pervasive feature of the terrestrial biosphere and contribute large carbon emissions within the earth system. Humans are responsible for the majority of fire ignitions. Physical and empirical models are used to estimate the future effects of fires on vegetation dynamics and the Earth’s system. However, there is no consensus on how human-caused fire ignitions should be represented in such models. This study aimed to identify which globally available predictors of human activity explain global fire ignitions as observed by satellites. We applied a random forest machine learning framework to state-of-the-art global climate, vegetation, and land cover datasets to establish a baseline against which influences of socioeconomic data (cropland fraction, gross domestic product (GDP), road density, livestock density, grazed lands) on fire ignition occurrence were evaluated. Our results showed that a baseline random forest without human predictors captured the spatial patterns of fire ignitions globally, with hotspots over Sub-Saharan Africa and South East Asia. Adding single human predictors to the baseline model revealed that human variables vary in their effects on fire ignitions and that of the variables considered GDP is the most vital driver of fire ignitions. A combined model with all human predictors showed that the human variables improve the ignition predictions in most regions of the world, with some regions exhibiting worse predictions than the baseline model. We concluded that an ensemble of human predictors can add value to physical and empirical models. There are complex relationships between the variables, as evidenced by the improvement in bias in the combined model compared to the individual models. Furthermore, the variables tested have complex relationships that random forests may struggle to disentangle. Further work is required to detangle the complex regional relationships between these variables. These variables, e.g., population density, are well documented to have substantial effects on fire at local and regional scales; we determined that these variables may provide more insight at more continental scales.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/fire6050197,"",,

Forest ecosystems are facing significant challenges due to ongoing climate change, characterized by rising temperatures and increased frequency of extreme events. The rapid pace of climate change is altering disturbance patterns and the adaptability of forests, which have a direct impact on ecosystem services that contribute to human well-being. This Special Issue features 11 research papers from nine countries. Some key outputs from these research papers include evidence on how climate change is already impacting forest ecosystems. For instance, the climatic envelope of many forest species has shifted due to global warming, making species more vulnerable, especially in lower elevations and at the edges of their distribution. Urgent adaptive measures in forest management are necessary to address this challenge. Climate change also affects vegetation phenology, tree growth, stand productivity, reproduction rates, and stand regeneration. Remote sensing data and ecological modeling techniques play a crucial role in monitoring and understanding these changes, especially in remote regions where field measurements are limited. The rising frequency and intensity of extreme events like droughts, windstorms, and forest fires require enhanced prediction and automatic monitoring. Leveraging machine learning tools and remote sensing data is imperative. This Special Issue provides insights into the intricate relationships among forests, climate change, and human interventions.

The proportion of grassland habitat within 250 m (derived from the land cover maps), along with temperature and distance to sandy soils, were used as predictors in both Bayesian regularized neural network and random forest models. Models using grassland habitat from DW performed best (RMSE = 2.8 ± 0.03; average ± standard deviation across models), followed by ELC10 (RMSE = 2.85 ± 0.03) and WC (RMSE = 2.87 ± 0.02). All satellite-derived maps outperformed a manually mapped Norwegian land cover dataset called AR5 (RMSE = 3.02 ± 0.02).

While the differences in RMSE we observed between models were small, they may be significant when such models are used to prioritize grassland patches within a landscape for conservation subsidies or management policies. Partial dependencies in our models showed that increasing the proportion of grassland habitat is positively associated with wild bee species richness, thereby justifying bee conservation schemes that aim to enhance semi-natural grassland habitat. Our results confirm the utility of satellite-derived land cover maps in supporting high-resolution species distribution modeling and suggest there is scope to monitor changes in species distributions over time given the dense time series provided by products such as DW.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/rs15071749,"",,

We need to study the change law of competition between crops and weeds, and achieve scientific farmland weed management under the premise of protecting weed biodiversity. In the research, we perform a competitive experiment in Harbin, China, in 2021, with five periods of maize as the study subjects. Comprehensive competition indices (CCI-A) based on maize phenotypes were used to describe the dynamic processes and results of weeds competition. The relation between in structural and biochemical information of maize and weed competitive intensity (Levels 1–5) at different periods and the effects on yield parameters were analyzed. The results showed that the differences of maize plant height, stalk thickness, and N and P elements among different competition levels (Levels 1–5) changed significantly with increasing competition time. This directly resulted in 10%, 31%, 35% and 53% decrease in maize yield; and 3%, 7%, 9% and 15% decrease in hundred grain weight. Compared to the conventional competition indices, CCI-A had better dispersion in the last four periods and was more suitable for quantifying the time-series response of competition. Then, multi-source remote sensing technologies are applied to reveal the temporal response of spectral and lidar information to community competition. The first-order derivatives of the spectra indicate that the red edge (RE) of competition stressed plots biased in short-wave direction in each period. With increasing competition time, RE of Levels 1–5 shifted towards the long wave direction as a whole. The coefficients of variation of canopy height model (CHM) indicate that weed competition had a significant effect on CHM. Finally, the deep learning model with multimodal data (Mul-3DCNN) is created to achieve a large range of CCI-A predictions for different periods, and achieves a prediction accuracy of R2 = 0.85 and RMSE = 0.095. Overall, this study use of CCI-A indices combined with multimodal temporal remote sensing imagery and DL to achieve large scale prediction of weed competitiveness in different periods of maize.","",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2023.118376,"",,

In Amazonia, soil conditions are highly heterogeneous, which has important implications for the distribution and dynamics of the area's exceptional biodiversity. Unfortunately, available soil maps for this region suffer from inaccuracies and lack of ecologically relevant variables. Here, we develop a map of the sum of exchangeable base cation concentration (SB) in the surface soil by applying machine learning to a comprehensive set of over 10,000 field data points of SB values directly measured from soil samples or inferred using indicator plant species occurrences. As predictors, we used rasters of soil type probabilities, elevation, biomass and reflectance values from Landsat satellite images. Random Forest (RF) models were trained and tested using two different cross-validation strategies. We also assessed in which areas the map was more reliable using the area of applicability approach and compared the results with two other soil layers. The best predictors of SB variation were Landsat bands 7, 4 and 3, elevation, and probability of Histosols. The regional patterns observed across Amazonia were consistent with current geological understanding; lower SB values tended to occur in central Amazonian soils and higher values in western Amazonian soils, with considerable variation within each region. The model was found applicable over most of the Amazonian biome, especially in non-inundated (terra-firme) forest, but not over coastal areas, floodplains of major rivers and wetlands, which were poorly represented in the training data. Our new SB map over performed previous SB map and represent an accurate and ecologically meaningful variable. It is available as a digital GIS layer and can be used in habitat mapping and in modeling the current or future distributions of biological communities and species. This will advance general understanding of Amazonian biogeography and help in conservation planning.","",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.geodrs.2023.e00645,"",,

The contribution of forests to carbon storage and biodiversity conservation highlights the need for accurate forest height and biomass mapping and monitoring. In France, forests are managed mainly by private owners and divided into small stands, requiring 10 to 50 m spatial resolution data to be correctly separated. Further, 35 % of the French forest territory is covered by mountains and Mediterranean forests which are managed very extensively. In this work, we used a deep-learning model based on multi-stream remote-sensing measurements (NASA's Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) lidar mission and ESA's Copernicus Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellites) to create a 10 m resolution canopy height map of France for 2020 (FORMS-H). In a second step, with allometric equations fitted to the French National Forest Inventory (NFI) plot data, we created a 30 m resolution above-ground biomass density (AGBD) map (Mg ha−1) of France (FORMS-B). Extensive validation was conducted. First, independent datasets from airborne laser scanning (ALS) and NFI data from thousands of plots reveal a mean absolute error (MAE) of 2.94 m for FORMS-H, which outperforms existing canopy height models. Second, FORMS-B was validated using two independent forest inventory datasets from the Renecofor permanent forest plot network and from the GLORIE forest inventory with MAE of 59.6 and 19.6 Mg ha−1, respectively, providing greater performance than other AGBD products sampled over France.

The land use factors that contribute most significantly to increased malaria risk remained those which put people in direct contact with forests, including conducting forest chores, having an outdoor job, and having a primary occupation in the logging and/or plantation industry.Malaria prevention methods in Myanmar should focus on anyone who lives near forests or engages in land use activities that bring them within proximity of forested landscapes, whether through occupation or chores.","",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijregi.2023.06.006,"",,

Therefore, they are subject to regulatory monitoring in terms of water quality. However, land-use intensification, such as open-cast mining activities, can have a direct impact on water quality. Unfortunately, in situ measurements of water quality parameters are spatially limited, costly and time-consuming, which is why we proposed a combination of hyperspectral data, in situ data and simple regression models in this study to estimate and thus monitor various water quality parameters. We focused on the variables of total iron, ferrous iron, ferric iron, sulphate and chlorophyll-a. Unlike other studies, we used a combination of airborne hyperspectral and RGB data to ensure a very high spatial resolution of the data. To investigate the potential of our approach, we conducted simultaneous in situ measurements and airborne hyperspectral/RGB aircraft campaigns at different sites of the Spree River in Germany to monitor the impact of pyrite weathering on water bodies after open-cast mining activities. Appropriate regression models were developed to estimate the five variables mentioned above. The model with the best performance for each variable gave a coefficient of determination R2 of 64% to 79%. This clearly shows the potential of airborne hyperspectral/RGB data for water quality monitoring. In further investigations, we focused on the use of machine learning techniques, as well as transferability to other water bodies. The approach presented here has great potential for the development of a monitoring method for the continuous monitoring of still waters and large watercourses, especially given the freely available space-based hyperspectral missions via EnMAP.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/w15081532,"",,
rayyan-220229025,Quantification of Microtopography in Natural Ecosystems Using Close-Range Remote Sensing,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Microtopography plays an important role in various ecological, hydrologic, and biogeochemical processes. However, quantifying the characteristics of microtopography represents a data-intensive challenge. Over the last decade, high-resolution or close-range remote sensing data and techniques have emerged as powerful tools to quantify microtopography. Traditional field surveys were mostly limited to transects or small plots, using limited sets of observations but with the decrease in the cost of close-range remote sensing technologies and the increase in computing performance, the microtopography even in forested environments can be assessed. The main objective of this article is to provide a systematic framework for microtopographic studies using close-range remote sensing technologies. This is achieved by reviewing the application of close-range remote sensing to capture microtopography and develop microtopographic models in natural ecosystems. Specifically, to achieve the main objectives, we focus on addressing the following questions: (1) What terrain attributes represent microtopography in natural ecosystems? (2) What spatial resolution of terrain attributes is needed to represent the microtopography? (3) What methodologies have been adopted to collect data at selected resolutions? (4) How to assess microtopography? Current research, challenges, and applicability of close-range remote sensing techniques in different terrains are analyzed with an eye to enhancing the use of these new technologies. We highlight the importance of using a high-resolution DEM (less than 1 m2 spatial resolution) to delineate microtopography. Such a high-resolution DEM can be generated using close-range remote sensing techniques. We also illustrate the need to move beyond elevation and include terrain attributes, such as slope, aspect, terrain wetness index, ruggedness, flow accumulation, and flow path, and assess their role in influencing biogeochemical processes such as greenhouse gas emissions, species distribution, and biodiversity. To assess microtopography in terms of physical characteristics, several methods can be adopted, such as threshold-based classification, mechanistically-based delineation, and machine learning-based delineation of microtopography. The microtopographic features can be analyzed based on physical characteristics such as area, volume, depth, and perimeter, or by using landscape metrics to compare the classified microtopographic features. Remote sensing techniques, when used in conjunction with field experiments/data, provide new avenues for researchers in understanding ecological functions such as biodiversity and species distribution, hydrological processes, greenhouse gas emissions, and the environmental factors that influence those parameters. To our knowledge, this article provides a comprehensive and detailed review of microtopography data acquisition and quantification for natural ecosystem studies.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/rs15092387,"",,

The Chure region of the Sarlahi district in Nepal is a critical ecological zone that has experienced significant LULC changes in recent years. In this study, our aim was to apply a machine learning approach to detect LULC changes in the Chure region using Google Earth Engine (GEE) and the Random Forest classifier. We utilized Landsat imagery of 2007 and 2022 to generate land cover maps for each year, which were then compared to identify changes over time. The major findings of this study indicate that the forest cover in the region has increased by approximately 16% over the past 15 years, while the agriculture and built-up areas have also shown a significant increase. Conversely, the barren land and water areas have decreased. The classifier obtained an overall accuracy of 85.7% and a kappa coefficient of 81.2% for the year 2022, and an overall accuracy of 82.2% and a kappa coefficient of 76.8% for the year 2007, which demonstrates the high accuracy of the proposed approach. The use of GEE and random forest classifiers provided a cost-effective and efficient method for analysing large datasets and producing accurate LULC maps. Our findings can inform policymakers and conservationists about the need for sustainable land management practices to preserve the ecological integrity of the Chure region.

As little as 10% of the original seasonally dry tropical forest (SDTF) remains for Ecuador, Peru, and Colombia. Remnant forests show high rates of species endemism, but experience degradation from climate change, wood-cutting, and livestock-grazing. Forest census data provide a vital resource for examining remote sensing methods to estimate diversity levels. We used spatially referenced trees ≥5 cm in diameter and simulated 0.10 ha plots measured from a 9 ha SDTF in southwestern Ecuador to compare machine learning (ML) models for six α-diversity indices. We developed 1 m tree canopy height and elevation models from stem mapped trees, at a scale conventionally derived from light detection and ranging (LiDAR). We then used an ensemble ML approach comparing single- and combined-sensor models from RapidEye, Sentinel-2 and interpolated canopy height and topography surfaces. Validation data showed that combined models often outperformed single-sensor approaches. Combined sensor and model ensembles for tree species richness, Shannon’s H, inverse Simpson’s, unbiased Simpson’s, and Fisher’s alpha indices typically showed lower root mean squared error (RMSE) and increased goodness of fit (R2). Piélou’s J, a measure of evenness, was poorly predicted.

rayyan-220229065,Dataset on the global distribution of shallow groundwater,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Shallow groundwater (GW), defined as the water table of unconfined or perched aquifers that is near enough to the land surface to influence the vadose zone and the surface soil moisture, impacts land surface water, energy, and carbon cycles by providing additional moisture to the root zone via capillary fluxes. Although the interactions of shallow GW and the terrestrial land surface are widely recognized, incorporating shallow GW into the land surface, climate, and agroecosystem models is not yet possible due to the lack of groundwater data. Groundwater systems are affected by various factors, including climate, land use/land cover, ecosystems, GW extractions, and lithology. Although GW wells are the most direct and accurate way of monitoring water table depths at point scales, upscaling GW levels from point scale to areal or regional scale poses significant challenges. Here, we provide high spatiotemporal resolution global maps of the terrestrial land surface areas influenced by shallow GW from mid-2015 to 2021 (a separate NetCDF file for each year) in a 9 km spatial and daily temporal resolution. We derived this data from NASA's Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission spaceborne soil moisture observations with a temporal resolution of 3 days and approximately 9 km grid resolution. This spatial scale corresponds to SMAP's ""Equal Area Scalable Earth"" (EASE) grids. The central assumption is that the monthly moving average of soil moisture observations and their coefficient of variation are sensitive to shallow GW regardless of the prevailing climate. We process the Level-2 enhanced passive soil moisture SMAP (SPL2SMP_E) product to detect shallow GW signals. The presence of shallow GW data is calculated by an ensemble machine learning model, which is trained using simulations from a variably saturated soil moisture flow model (Hydrus-1D). The simulations span various climates, soil textures, and lower boundary conditions. The spatiotemporal distribution of shallow GW data based on SMAP soil moisture observations is provided for the first time with this dataset. The data are of value in a wide variety of applications. The most direct use is in climate and land surface models as lower boundary conditions or as a diagnostic tool to verify model results. Some other applications may include flood risk analyses and regulation, identifying geotechnical issues such as shallow GW-triggered liquefaction, global food security, ecosystem services, watershed management, crop yield, vegetation health, water storage trends, and tracking mosquito-borne diseases by identifying wetlands, among other applications.","",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dib.2023.108973,"",,

However, the surface parameters for Land Surface Models (LSMs) within ESMs running at the k-scale are typically derived from coarse resolution and outdated datasets. This study aims to develop a new set of global land surface parameters with a resolution of 1 km for multiple years from 2001 to 2020, utilizing the latest and most accurate available datasets. Specifically, the datasets consist of parameters related to land use and land cover, vegetation, soil, and topography. To demonstrate the capability of these new parameters, we conducted 1 km resolution simulations using the E3SM Land Model version 2 (ELM2) over the contiguous United States. Our results demonstrate that land surface parameters contribute to significant spatial heterogeneity in ELM2 simulations of soil moisture, latent heat, emitted longwave radiation, and absorbed shortwave radiation. On average, about 31% to 54% of spatial information is lost by upscaling the 1 km ELM2 simulations to a 12 km resolution.

However, intercomparisons between current available long-term global LAI products present significant spatiotemporal inconsistencies which have been a persistent source of uncertainties in global change ecology. Yet, a direct and systematic evaluation of current long-term LAI products is still lacking due to the absence of appropriate LAI references, especially before 2000. Here, we proposed a novel evaluation framework to directly evaluate the mainstream long-term global LAI products (GIMMS LAI3g, GLASS LAI, and GLOBMAP LAI) using massive high-quality LAI validation samples. The LAI validation samples, derived from the Landsat archive using machine learning and MODIS LAI, have a global distribution, a long temporal coverage (1982−2020), and a large amount of 4.9 million. They substantially address the issue of insufficient LAI reference data and can enable quantitative LAI assessments. The long-term global LAI products showed reasonable quality in terms of absolute value, with GIMMS LAI3g having better performance (R:0.96; MAE: 0.29 m^2 m^(-2); RMSE: 0.49 m^2 m^(-2)), followed by GLASS LAI (R:0.96; MAE: 0.31 m^2 m^(-2); RMSE: 0.51 m^2 m^(-2)) and GLOBMAP LAI (R:0.90; MAE: 0.52 m^2 m^(-2); RMSE: 0.91 m^2 m^(-2)).

Their annual maximum LAI trends presented mediocre consistencies with the LAI validation samples (R: 0.20−0.29) which showed a significantly larger area of greening. The evaluation of ten state-of-the-art ecosystem models demonstrated varied capabilities in simulating global LAI trends, with the standard deviations ranging from ~0.01 to 0.04 m^2 m^(-2) a^(-1). Although the Multi-Model Ensemble Mean LAI agreed with satellite-based LAI products, they differed with vegetation biomes especially for the tropics.

There is no conclusive solution to effectively protect heritage sties in the foreseeable future, and the public is becoming increasingly conscious about the negative impacts some anthropogenic activities have brought to heritage sites, exposing them to various risks for irreversible damage and loss. In light of this predicament, UNESCO, alongside its conservation partners, has been actively calling for the use of non-intrusive space technology (ST) to better evaluate and understand the detrimental factors surrounding WH sites and devise effective plans to mitigate negative impacts on OUV through the accurate identification, documentation, monitoring, and understanding of WH sites and their changes across large spatiotemporal scales. For this commentary, ST refers mainly to remote sensing (RS) based on Earth observation (EO) from space, as well as other geospatial information technologies such as geographic information systems (GIS) and global navigation satellite systems (GNSS). Even though ST was not developed intentionally for WH protection, it provides an advanced set of innovative and flexible tools that integrate scientific research into heritage science, which forms the evidential base to support measures for the protection of WH sites. ST also opens up paths of methodological innovation to facilitate future conservation of cultural and natural properties with new paradigms. On the basis of a half-century review of the applications of ST in the field of WH, we find that ST has effectively reshaped our means for WH conservation in four major domains of application: mapping, monitoring, modeling, and management of WH sites (Figure 1A). ST, as an objective and reliable ""eye"" from above for heritage experts, has enabled detailed mapping of heritages at various scales. This application commonly involves the acquisition and updatable analysis of multimodal datasets, combined with near real-time survey and investigation of WH sites and their contextual environments. ST is also an invaluable tool in identifying and designating potential new WH sites. The widespread integration of ST has played a crucial role in UNESCO's routine monitoring and emergency monitoring of cultural and natural heritages as a countermeasure to the challenges presented by global change. In particular, ST has made major contributions to fine-grained monitoring at very high resolutions in time and space and in assessing change caused by natural and/or anthropogenic processes. The combined application of RS, GIS, and augmented reality has facilitated the production of three-dimensional (3D) modeling of WH sites. In addition, photogrammetry and laser scanning can be used in WH surveys for generating 3D documentation of cultural and natural properties. Heritage information models of some popular WH sites have already been actively used in the fields of architecture study and digital ecology. The ability of ST to contribute to the conservation, planning, and management of WH sites has already been commonly used in the following domains: the definition of authenticity and integrity (AI), the mapping of OUV attributes of cultural and natural assets, the development and maintenance of heritage databases, 3D modeling and digital reconstruction, and informing WH management for sustainable development. The UNESCO WHC refers to its ""strategic objectives"" as the ""5 C's"": credibility, conservation, capacity building, communication, and communities.1UNESCO, United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization. Operational Guidelines for the Implementation of the World Heritage Convention. Paris, France: UNESCO, 2021.Google Scholar Here, we propose five key contributions (""5 D's"") of ST for conservation work involving WH sites (see Figure 1B): data, driver, discovery, digital transformation, and decision support. ST and the 5 D's, together with the WHC, constitute the ""turbine model"" for safeguarding WH that is proposed in this commentary and will assist in achieving the 5 C's over the next 50 years. By providing massive multi-source data, ST plays a crucial role in the WH governance chain. Archived data together with ongoing data acquisition record changes at WH sites and provide evidence for their conservation. The data collected through ST will, in turn, serve as an invaluable store of not only raw observations but also derivative products that can be extracted from imagery.5Levin N. Ali S. Crandall D. et al.World Heritage in danger: big data and remote sensing can help protect sites in conflict zones.Global Environ. Change. 2019; 55: 97-104Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar As a result of this data mechanism, ST will be able to mitigate the problem of lacunae in WH data by offering global coverage and consistency. ST is driving a revolution to become a new paradigm of WH protection. It provides advanced tools, such as RS data processing and GIS spatial analysis powered by machine learning, which can be used for dynamic monitoring and spatiotemporal analysis of changes that are occurring at WH sites. From this enhanced monitoring method, WH specialists and managers are empowered with the tools to monitor change over time and to assess whether conservation efforts to mitigate the impacts of natural and anthropogenic processes are contributing to positive outcomes toward sustainability. ST plays a key role in aiding frontier research across multiple disciplines related to heritage science. Scientific discoveries based on the use of new geospatial technologies and big EO data can be applied to the quantitative assessment of the state of WH protection. They can also be used to support deepened multidimensional interpretations of the OUV of WH sites, to guide the sustainable use of WH, and to improve accessibility so that all stakeholders may obtain unbiased and open information, thus increasing the credibility of WH as a global brand. ST provides a means of digital transformation that can be used for identifying, understanding, visualizing, presenting, and interpreting WH sites and their OUV in the digital space. In the future, ST will promote the transformation of WH protection through studies such as tangible heritage, digitalized heritage, or both. GIS-aided digital transformation will greatly improve the quality and efficiency of global communication and the dissemination of information related to WH sites, promoting public awareness of protection concepts and smoothing the implementation of actions. ST is becoming an invaluable tool to provide decision-making support along the entire chain of WH governance, from mapping to monitoring, modeling, and management. ST-based solutions could offer spatial intelligence to inform strategic decision making for multiple stakeholders, including local communities, WH sectors, institutions, and organizations. It offers an innovative path for capacity building and capacity enhancement in relation to the global governance of WH. These solutions are delivered in numerous ways, including databases, technologies, protocols, visualization platforms, and analytical systems. WH is under the influence of a wide array of anthropogenic and natural processes, giving the heritage bodies and national and international organizations promoting the preservation of WH sites an unprecedented opportunity to use science, technology, and innovation, including ST, to experiment innovative solutions and promote the role of WH in achieving sustainable development. Given that natural and anthropogenic challenges can present similar issues in various regions across the globe, it is evident that sharing knowledge and expertise, as well as developing collective strategies to leverage ST, while tailoring our methods to local circumstances, will be fundamental in developing a global approach for WH that is successful in the long run. The past 50 years of applications have resulted in continuous innovation in the development of ST to become powerful, cutting-edge tools for use in heritage documentation, monitoring, assessment and protection, and sustainable development. Although the progress is promising, we must underscore that relying solely on ST is insufficient; the greatest benefits are achieved by integrating ST with a variety of disciplines, such as management, economics, sustainability, sociology, education, ethics, politics, law, art, and aesthetics. Through closer and sustained engagement with a broader cross-section of society and local communities, ST can contribute to opening new horizons for WH protection over the course of the twenty-first century.

It is extensively used in a variety of sectors, including land resource planning, monitoring and forecasting of agricultural plant health, and monitoring and assessment of natural disasters. Remote sensing images provide a large amount of long-term and fully covered data for earth environmental monitoring. A lot of progress has been made thanks to deep learning's quick development. But the majority of deep learning-based change detection techniques currently in use rely on the well-known Convolutional neural network (CNN). However, Considering the locality of convolutional operation, convolutional neural network unable to master the interplay between global and distant semantic information.Some researches has employ ViT as a backbone in remote sensing field. Inspired by these researches, in this paper, we propose a network named Siam-Swin-Unet, which is a Siamesed pure Transformer with U-shape construction for remote sensing image change detection.Swin Transformer is a hierarchical vision transformer with shifted windows that can extract global feature. To learn local and global semantic feature information, the dual-time image are fed into Siam-Swin-Unet which is composed of Swin Transformer,Unet Siamesenet and two feature fusion module.Considered the Unet and Siamesenet are effective for change detection, We applied it to the model.The feature fusion module is design for fusion of dual-time image features,and is efficient and low-compute confirmed by our experiments.Our network achieved 94.67 F1 on the CDD dataset (season varying).","",https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-3236851/v1,"",,
rayyan-220229185,Interpretation and Spatiotemporal Analysis of Terraces in the Yellow River Basin Based on Machine Learning,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"The Yellow River Basin (YRB) is a crucial ecological zone and an environmentally vulnerable region in China. Understanding the temporal and spatial trends of terraced-field areas (TRAs) and the factors underlying them in the YRB is essential for improving land use, conserving water resources, promoting biodiversity, and preserving cultural heritage. In this study, we employed machine learning on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform to obtain spatial distribution images of TRAs from 1990 to 2020 using Landsat 5 (1990–2010) and Landsat 8 (2015–2020) remote sensing data. The GeoDa software (software version number is 1.20.0.) platform was used for spatial autocorrelation analysis, revealing distinct spatial clustering patterns. Mixed linear and random forest models were constructed to identify the driving force factors behind TRA changes. The research findings reveal that TRAs were primarily concentrated in the upper and middle reaches of the YRB, encompassing provinces such as Shaanxi, Shanxi, Qinghai, and Gansu, with areas exceeding 40,000 km2, whereas other provinces had TRAs of less than 30,000 km2 in total. The TRAs exhibited a relatively stable trend, with provinces such as Gansu, Qinghai, and Shaanxi showing an overall upward trajectory. Conversely, Shanxi and Inner Mongolia demonstrated an overall declining trend. When compared with other provinces, the variations in TRAs in Ningxia, Shandong, Sichuan, and Henan appeared to be more stable. The linear mixed model (LMM) revealed that farmland, shrubs, and grassland had significant positive effects on the TRAs, explaining 41.6% of the variance. The random forest model also indicated positive effects for these factors, with high R2 values of 0.984 and 0.864 for the training and testing sets, respectively, thus outperforming the LMM. The findings of this study can contribute to the restoration of the YRB’s ecosystem and support sustainable development. The insights gained will be valuable for policymaking and decision support in soil and water conservation, agricultural planning, and environmental protection in the region.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/su152115607,"",,
rayyan-220229205,Impact of climate change on groundwater levels in the Iberian Peninsula,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Groundwater represents a strategic freshwater resource for multiple sectors, including drinking water, agriculture production, and ecosystem services. The Mediterranean Basin is a well-known water-scarce region that is increasingly relying on groundwater use, especially during drought periods. Many areas in the Mediterranean region are already facing water stress due to increasing demand and limited resources. Climate change is likely to exacerbate these issues, as it is expected to lead to more frequent and severe drought conditions in some areas as well as irregular rainfall in others. Due to the growing availability of data and computational processing capabilities nowadays, deep learning models are seeing an increase in popularity. In this study, we attempted to create 92 location-specific Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models in wells spatially distributed over the Iberian Peninsula to estimate groundwater levels until the end of the century. Our models use monthly precipitation and temperature data as input variables. Specifically, we considered cumulative precipitation for 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, and 36 months to account for the recharge time lag between precipitation and groundwater changes. Once trained using historical precipitation and temperature records, the CNNs were applied to assess the influence of climate change on groundwater levels. For future climate projections, an ensemble of six combinations of distinct General Circulation Models (GCMs) and Regional Climate Models (RCMs) was considered under two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs): the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. Our preliminary results revealed a more consistent decline in groundwater levels in the southwest region of the Iberian Peninsula under the RCP8.5 scenario, while a general more constant groundwater level under the RCP4.5 scenario has been detected towards the end of the century. Detailed results of this study will be shared and discussed during the event.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu23-12968,"",,

Hazards to the native flora due to Acacia's fast invasion and threats to forest fires have resulted in increased risks of burnable oil. In line with Brunei's National Climate Change Policy, which is reflected in Brunei Vision 2035, it is crucial to conserve Brunei's extensive forest cover by proactive management of the Acacia population in the country's tropical rainforests. Therefore, In line with Brunei's National Climate Change Policy, which is reflected in the Brunei vision, active management of the Acacia population in Brunei's rainforests is considered crucial as it can determine and scope out the country's extensive forest cover. In order to identify the species of Acacia tree and the coverage, this study uses UAV-based, high-resolution RGB photos that have been analysed by machine learning software. The images captured are tested and analysed using a convolutional neural network (CNN) model which is trained to detect the Acacia tree species highlighting regions that indicated a maximum accuracy of 84% based on the manually annotated datasets.","",https://doi.org/10.1145/3594692.3594697,"",,

Many detection and mapping systems which are created use a lot of tools, including artificial intelligence methods and good human observations. One of the most used systems is satellite. Remote sensing imagery is widely used for forest fire detection (FFD) due to their large zone coverage, which uses traditional and deep learning methods. In the last decade deep learning techniques have given promising results in remote sensing problems. This study uses Landsat-8 images dataset and deep convolutional network method for FFD. The network used in this paper has a special characteristic which is using simultaneously multiple kernels with different sizes. In this work, to improve the performance of forest fire detection, we have used several data in the deep learning input layer: bands 2, 6 and 7 of Landsat-8, and Forest Fire Index value, which is powerful index for FFD. Three different scenarios were used in this study with 3 network configurations for each one, resulting in 9 total distinct models, using multiple kernels of 3x3, 5x5 and 7x7.

rayyan-220229280,"Projected land cover changes in 2031 in Awangpone watershed, South Sulawesi, Indonesia",,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract One of the factors of watershed damage is that water catchment areas are decreasing due to land use changes caused by various human activities such as logging, forest encroachment, and development carried out in watersheds. Continuous changes without consideration in land use management will adversely affect all elements in a watershed, especially land closures that have a major impact on water availability. This study aims to project land cover changes by 2031 in the Awangpone river basin, Bone Regency, South Sulawesi. This study used a Cellular Automata-Artificial Neural Network (CA-ANN) simulation to make projections of land cover changes in 2031. The results of this study show a change in land cover from 2020 to 2031. Land closures that experienced an increase in area were in the residential class of 214.15 ha or 1.69% and the fishpond class of 58.38 ha or 0.46%. Meanwhile, dryland agricultural classes mixed with shrubs, shrubs, mangrove forests and rice fields have experienced a reduction in area. The changes that occurred both the reduction and the increase in the area of the land closure class in the Awangpone watershed were influenced by land conversion, where the addition of settlements caused a class reduction in other land closures.","",https://doi.org/10.1088/1755-1315/1230/1/012046,"",,

Despite the progress in species distribution modeling (SDM) over the past decades, SDM have just begun to integrate high resolution remote sensing data and their predictions are still entailed by many biases due to heterogeneity of the available biodiversity observations, most often opportunistic presence only data. We designed a European scale dataset covering around ten thousand plant species to calibrate and evaluate SDM predictions of species composition in space and time at high spatial resolution (~ten meters), and their spatial transferability. For model training, we extracted and harmonized five million heterogeneous presence-only records from selected GBIF datasets and 6 thousand exhaustive presence-absence surveys both sampled during 2017-2021. We associated species observations to diverse environmental rasters classically used in SDMs, as well as to 10 m resolution RGB and Near-Infra-Red satellite images and 20 years-time series of climatic variables and satellite point values. The evaluation dataset is based on 22 thousand standardized presence-absence surveys separated from the training set with a spatial block hold out procedure. The GeoLifeCLEF 2023 dataset is open access and the first benchmark for researchers aiming to improve the prediction of plant species composition at a very fine spatial grain and at continental scale. It is a space to explore new ways of combining massive and diverse species observations and environmental information at various scales. Innovative AI-based approaches, in particular, should be among the most interesting methods to experiment with on the GeoLifeCLEF 2023 dataset.","",https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2308.05121,"",,
rayyan-220229318,Toward Foundation Models for Earth Monitoring: Generalizable Deep Learning Models for Natural Hazard Segmentation,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Climate change results in an increased probability of extreme weather events that put societies and businesses at risk on a global scale. Therefore, near real-time mapping of natural hazards is an emerging priority for the support of natural disaster relief, risk management, and informing governmental policy decisions. Recent methods to achieve near real-time mapping increasingly leverage deep learning (DL). However, DL-based approaches are designed for one specific task in a single geographic region based on specific frequency bands of satellite data. Therefore, DL models used to map specific natural hazards struggle with their generalization to other types of natural hazards in unseen regions. In this work, we propose a methodology to significantly improve the generalizability of DL natural hazards mappers based on pre-training on a suitable pre-task. Without access to any data from the target domain, we demonstrate this improved generalizability across four U-Net architectures for the segmentation of unseen natural hazards. Importantly, our method is invariant to geographic differences and differences in the type of frequency bands of satellite data. By leveraging characteristics of unlabeled images from the target domain that are publicly available, our approach is able to further improve the generalization behavior without fine-tuning. Thereby, our approach supports the development of foundation models for earth monitoring with the objective of directly segmenting unseen natural hazards across novel geographic regions given different sources of satellite imagery.","",https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2301.09318,"",,
rayyan-220229326,Assessing land degradation neutrality in data scarce semi-arid drylands agroecosystems to improve land resources management: a case study in Matabeleland North Province of Zimbabwe.,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Semi-arid agroecosystems have a crucial function in supplying food and ecosystem services. However, these ecosystems are under severe threat due to land degradation. To enhance our understanding of environmental trends and their causes and to identify more sustainable land management techniques, it is important to track land degradation in space and time. This study uses land cover, soil organic carbon, and land productivity dynamics maps to evaluate land degradation neutrality (as per Sustainable Development Goal 15, indicator 15.3.1). In this regard, we employed the trends.earth tool in QGIS 3.3, utilising the European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative (ESA CCI) classified LULC maps for 1992, 2000, 2010, and 2020 to assess land degradation. Additionally, we predicted 2050 LULC maps using the MOLUSCE plugin in QGIS, which integrates an artificial neural network (ANN) in cellular automata (CA) modeling (CA-ANN) based on the 2015 LULC map and independent variables such as digital elevation model (DEM) and slope. Our results indicated a significant decrease in bare areas (71%) and an increase in settlements (built-up areas) (163%) between 1992 and 2020. Furthermore, the predicted land cover map shows a significant increase in bare land (238%) and settlements (72%), accompanied by a decrease in water bodies (23%) and forested areas (3.5%). In terms of land degradation, approximately 26.46% of the province exhibited degraded land, accounting for approximately 20,146.35 km , while approximately 59.55% (45,337.84 km ) of the land remained stable. Land cover conversions, particularly from forests to grasslands and settlements, are among the potential drivers of land degradation. Identifying land cover transitions and assessing land degradation is paramount for effective monitoring and planning. By understanding these dynamics, targeted interventions can be developed to mitigate land degradation and promote sustainable land use practices in semi-arid agroecosystems.","",https://doi.org/10.22541/au.168982569.96810532/v1,"",,
rayyan-220229335,What's hot and why?,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Most researchers think that their work is the best thing going. And why not? They are dedicating part of their professional careers to their research and who would choose to work on pedestrian topics? When I hear the term hot topics or hot button topics, I usually think these are the topics The Journal of Wildlife Management (JWM) should be addressing. How does the scientific community view hot issues (i.e., hot button topics) in management and conservation? To address the question, I used keyword clouds provided by Wiley (J. Wood, Wiley, personal communication) for JWM and related journals from 2018 to 2022 that contain the most common keywords for articles published in the journals. The keywords are generated using deep learning (from Wiley, derived from articles indexed in Web of Science, under licence) and do not necessarily include author-designated keywords. The keywords provide an overview of the most popular themes being published in our subject area in recent years. At best, the deep learning keywords provide a supplementary tool based on specialist knowledge of the field to provide an overview of hot button topics. It will not provide a list of ready-made hot button topics, but themes may become apparent in conjunction with the keyword clouds. Although hot button topics sound like they are the most important topics in the scientific literature, it is important to understand what exactly is meant by the term. Publishers examine articles just as authors do but have different criteria to look at a broad array of journals and articles to see what is hot and what is not. In the data collection for this editorial, hot button topics published in the past 2 years are those that have achieved enough citations, according to the Web of Science, in September and October 2022 to place a manuscript in the top 0.1% of papers in its academic field (H. Dasari, Wiley, personal communication). Highly cited papers are not necessarily hot button topics; they must also be recently published manuscripts. Older manuscripts could have numerous citations but would not be included as a hot button topic because they were not recently published (H. Dasari, personal communication). The Merriam-Webster dictionary (https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/hot%20button) defines a hot button topic as “an emotional and usually controversial issue or concern that triggers immediate intense reaction.” Wow! Just the things that science uses data to avoid. The definition from the Web of Science can be summarized as popular themes that have enough recent citations to be paced in the top 0.01% of articles in the field. And, The Wildlife Society avoids the hot button term altogether and instead talks about hot (i.e., important) topics to be addressed. So, with those definitions in mind, I examined >4,000 articles from approximately 30 publishers of 133 journals from 2019–2022 ranging from ACTA Ornithologica to the Wildlife Society Bulletin and everything in between that published papers related to wildlife (there is a lot of competition out there for wildlife papers). I then grouped the articles into broad categories. To determine the most popular themes, I only categorized individual articles that had >10 citations and categorized groups of articles that had >100 citations (n = 610 articles). Categories that met this criterion included climate change (332 citations), model selection (318 citations), conservation (264 citations), anthropogenic influences on wildlife (260 citations), single species articles from beavers to ungulates (229 citations), wildlife disease (226 citations), drone use in monitoring (226 citations), feral swine (212 citations), quantitative analysis (212 citations), monitoring with DNA (163 citations), monitoring (159 citations), the influence of lead on wildlife (156 citations), migrations (144 citations), habitat (137 citations), bat conservation (124 citations), fire (101 citations), and raptors (101 citations). Over 3,000 manuscripts had <10 citations each and >1,000 did not have any citations at all. Many of those manuscripts that had <10 citations covered topics similar to those with >10 citations. Because these topics came from an array of journals, I also looked at 340 articles from 34 publishers from 2019–2022 and approximately 114 journals that specifically included the main competitors for JWM according to Wiley (Conservation Biology, European Journal of Wildlife Research, Journal of Animal Ecology, Journal of Fish and Wildlife Management, Journal of Mammalogy, Wildlife Biology, Wildlife Research). Categories that were listed as hot button topics according to the Web of Science included conditions and contaminants of the atmosphere, lakes, oceans, and lands; Covid; climate change; food webs used in management; hunting quotas; reforestation; quantitative studies; thermal sensitivity of forests; overfishing; dominance interactions; mortality; declines of sharks and rays; and plant genome sequencing. These hot button topics were published in Nature (n = 7), Science (n = 3), 2 each from Climate Research, Earth System Science Data, and Global Change Biology and 1 each from Applied Sciences- Basel, Current Biology, Nature Plants, Nature Reviews Microbiology, New England Journal of Medicine, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, Proceedings of the Royal Society B-Biological Science, and Remote Sensing of the Environment. Six manuscripts from the Journal of Animal Ecology, 1 manuscript published in Conservation Biology, and 1 in the European Journal of Wildlife Research were highly cited but none of the hot button topics were published in any of our competitor's journals. The JWM had 1 highly cited manuscript but no hot button topics. It is not surprising that the main wildlife journals did not have any hot button topics as identified by the Web of Science. The hot button topics generally involved studies from large areas (e.g., multi states, continents, globally), over long periods (i.e., decades), that influence large groups of animals and humans (e.g., climate change, disease), and contribute to or distract from human well-being (e.g., air and water quality). While each of these are important, most research on wildlife relates to single species in local or regional areas, over short time periods, that test 1 or 2 hypothesis, and are often inconclusive. For example, the November 2022 issue of the JWM (86[8]) included 16 research articles. The study area sizes for 14 studies averaged 63,605 km2 (range = 5–430,000 km2; 2 researchers simply listed a state as their study area) and the average time period for studies ranged from 1–50 years. The 50-year study was a modeling study and if that manuscript was deleted, the average time of study was about 6 years. Most of the studies were of single species examining a single aspect of population dynamics and researchers called for additional research, better parameters than they used, or both for making inferences. The components of animal ecology are also important, especially for managers of wildlife in specific areas. They will just not be considered hot button topics by the scientific community overall. It is not surprising because many of the hot button topics relate to the condition of the earth (e.g., atmosphere, land, lakes, oceans) and topics the JWM does not address (e.g., overfishing, declines of fisheries, forest ecology) unless they have a direct application to wildlife (other than fisheries). The Wildlife Society regularly updates their hot issues (i.e., Policy Engagement Principles) and lists 10 categories (wildlife.org/hot-issues/, accessed 2 Mar 2023). Three are not directly related to wildlife (i.e., federal employee participation in professional societies, funding for conservation and management, strategic conservation planning), but the other 7 are (e.g., climate change and adaption, endangered species recovery, energy development and wildlife, invasive species prevention and management, the North American Model and Public Trust Doctrine, wetlands conservation, wildlife health). Just because the hot issues listed by the Web of Science or The Wildlife Society do not specifically identify population dynamics of wildlife populations as hot issues does not mean that they are not important; of course they are. Those are the data needed for conservation and management, which are the heart and soul of what many wildlifers strive to obtain. Any definition I would come up with for hot button topics would definitely include the population dynamics of animals from which management and conservation depend. The JWM welcomes all scientific topics that add to the wildlife literature and can benefit wildlife and their habitats. We welcome your submissions. J. Wood and H. Dasari provided the data for this editorial, which was enhanced by reviews of earlier drafts by both of them, A. S. Cox, and J. A. Bissonette.

rayyan-220229341,Reducing uncertainty in extreme weather vegetation stress modeling using satellite-model approach at high resolution,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Vegetation is a key driver for carbon uptake from the atmosphere to the land. Yet episodes of plant stress and mortality associated with drought and heat waves due to persistent lack of precipitation have been reported over the last decades and are expected to increase under ongoing climate change. It is presumed that climate-related vegetation stress results in progressively worsening plant health and rising mortality. However, the mechanisms driving such mortality are still up for debate because of the complex interconnections between the processes and the factors. Monitoring plant stress and mortality at the ecosystem level remains challenging to quantify since long-term, tree-individual, reliable observations are uncertain. For this reason, here we adapted a satellite-model approach to work on regional forests, before up scaling the results to the global forest.In Belgium, the Wallonia region is covered by 30% forests which are the highest among all the three regions. While with the consecutive recent extreme events especially the droughts and heat waves of 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2022 caused water stress and bark beetle attack. According to the 35 years (1985-2022), land use land cover change extracted by LANDSAT 5,7, and 8 satellites, there is no significant change in forest land in Wallonia, Belgium. Meanwhile, in the current years 2021-2022, there is a decrease in the tree canopy with intensive forest management due to tree plant stress. On the other hand, in Wallonia, the forest is distributed in a significant patch of broadleaves, coniferous leaves, and mixed forest. However, we found that consecutive drought events cause water stress on specific plant species like Norway spruce which are in vulnerable states. For example: in a mixed forest when bark beetle or Scolytinae attacked the spruce tree it is more attracted to the other trees and in this consequence tree species &amp;#8211;like &amp;#160;birch and oak &amp;#8211;are now also in premature death or deteriorating tree health. In this study, we are using a high spatial resolution (25cm) remote sensing images using Artificial Intelligence and machine learning techniques to find out pixel-based individual plant stress or mortality. In addition, the high-resolution tree mortality extracted data will be used to calibrate CARAIB dynamic vegetation model and analyze the impact of extreme events on trees during the recent past and the future (until 2070). In conclusion, from this study, we plan to improve our model regarding the implementation of plant traits and species mortality aspects towards a better prediction of forest tree species' vulnerability to future extreme weather events.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu23-15565,"",,

Despite their importance, deforestation has been rampant and has reached critical rates. Addressing this problem and further advancing conservation requires accurate mapping of mangroves, and understand the historical land cover changes. However, such information is sparse and insufficient to understand the change dynamics. In this study, mangrove cover change dynamics for Macajalar Bay, Philippines was determined using Landsat data and machine learning techniques. Vegetation maps derived from aerial photographs and satellite images were used to quantify mangroves and to monitor the rates of deforestation over a 70-year period. In 2020, the mangrove forest cover was estimated to be 187.67 ha, equivalent to only 58.00% of the 325.43 ha that was estimated in 1950. Original mangrove forest that existed in 1950 only represents 8.56% of the 2020 extent, suggesting that much of the old-growth mangrove have been cleared before 2000 and that contemporary mangrove extent is mainly composed of secondary forest. Highest deforestation rates occurred between 1950–1990 where it recorded a total of 258.51 ha, averaging a clearing rate of 6.46 ha/year. Clearing has been driven by large-scale aquaculture pond developments. Mangrove gains were evident in 2000 but it plateaued as it approaches 2020, while loss simultaneously increased since 2010. This indicates that mangroves gained since 2000 have experienced low survival rates. Promoting site-species matching, biophysical assessment, and verification of fishpond availability for mangrove rehabilitation programs are necessary undertakings to address such problems.","",https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-2875385/v1,"",,

Frommonitoring land use changes to studying climate patterns and disaster management, remote sensing hasbecome an indispensable tool for scientific research and practical applications. However, the effective application of remote sensing data often relies on the ability to classify andinterpret these vast and complex datasets. This presents a substantial challenge, as remote sensing datatypically exhibit high dimensionality, encompassing diverse terrain types, weather conditions, andimaging modalities. Furthermore, acquiring labeled data for supervised machine learning approaches isoften arduous, time-consuming, and expensive in remote sensing contexts. Few-shot learning emerges as a promising paradigm to address these issues. It seeks to develop modelscapable of learning from a limited amount of labeled data, which is a common scenario in remote sensingapplications due to the cost and effort associated with ground truth data collection. Few-shot learning isespecially valuable in cases where we need to recognize previously unseen classes or adapt quickly tochanging conditions, such as tracking forest fires or monitoring urban development. Despite its potential, few-shot learning in remote sensing faces significant hurdles, such as inadequatemodel generalization, limited data diversity, and challenges in feature extraction from complex datasources. In recent years, several advancements have been made in remote sensing image analysis, including the integration of deep learning techniques, but there remains a critical need for improving few- shot learning capabilities in this domain. This paper introduces a novel approach to address the limitations of few-shot learning in remote sensing. We propose the incorporation of an auxiliary generator powered by contrastive learning, a technique thathas demonstrated success in diverse applications, from natural language processing to computer vision. This auxiliary generator, working in conjunction with our few-shot learning model, enhances the ability todiscriminate between different classes and adapt to new remote sensing scenarios with limited labeleddata","",https://doi.org/10.31219/osf.io/2v46h,"",,
rayyan-220229473,Mapping water quality in complex estuarine and coastal waters using deep learning models and high-resolution satellite imagery,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Large-scale spatiotemporal water quality assessments are made possible with the advent of remote sensing imagery.Reliable remote water quality parameter estimations require sufficient in-situ measurements of surface water's Inherent Optical Properties (IOPs).These include absorption and backscattering coefficients of optically active dissolved and particulate matter that must match with corresponding remotely sensed Reflectance (Rrs).In most cases, there is a severe lack of overlapping matchups needed for effective calibration and validation of Total Suspended Sediment (TSS) and Dissolved Organic Carbon (DOC).These parameters are critical to understanding water quality degradation dynamics and developing sustainable water management practices.In addition, coastal regions are the most complex, with the interplay of land, river and ocean currents affecting the flow of largely turbid discharge.The optically complex discharge results in a non-linear mapping of the reflectance spectrum to the water quality parameters, further compounded by the anthropogenic contribution of sediment concentrations, natural events such as heavy rainfall, and their combination.Thus, we must quantify the non-linear relationship between Rrs and water quality parameters in different climate domains.In this study, we have numerically determined Rrs using radiative transfer modelling based on observed IOP measurements across the Hawkesbury, Hunter, and Clarence estuarine and coastal waters in New South Wales, Australia, during March and July 2022.We consider a 10% error in observed TSS/DOC measurements and simulate an ensemble of Rrs -ap/acdom/bbp -TSS/DOC dataset for each of the 56 stations where the field survey was conducted.The resulting dataset of ~4 million records provides a sample space big enough for developing Deep Learning -Neural Network (DL -NN) based architectures on a cloud-based Open Data Cube (ODC) environment.Deep Multi-Layer Perceptron (DMLP) NN and Convolution NN (CNN) were tested, with DMLP exhibiting lower inherent errors of 3% compared to 4.5% of CNNs.The DMLP NN was then spectrally convolved with available atmospheric-corrected Landsat-8 multi-spectral (443, 483, 561 and 655nm) imagery over the said basins for 2022 and compared with the regional spectral library-based i-SAM (Cherukuru et al., 2021;Sanwlani et al., 2022) derived TSS and DOC maps.This work compares existing regional models and explores the potential of DL NN in mapping TSS and DOC in complex coastal waters.The DMLP model exhibits improved computational efficiency and can be employed to map the sediment loads due to flood events across these river basins.","",https://doi.org/10.36334/modsim.2023.unnithan,"",,

The Sundarban deltaic region, witnessing the confluence of vast expanses of tropical mangrove forests, tidal rivers, and estuaries, is one such area. Considered as one of the richest biodiversity hotspot zones on earth, home to a large spectrum of biodiversity (flora and fauna), including endangered or threatened species, this forest plays a critical role in land reclamation, coastal habitat protection, and local socioeconomics. However, the forests have been experiencing changes due to climatic forces and anthropogenic activities. Monitoring these changes is crucial for adopting precise management practices. In this work Landsat 8 images were used to identify the land use and land cover in the Sundarbans. For classification, a new deep Neural Network (DNN) model is proposed. A comparative analysis of overall accuracy (OA) of the proposed DNN model with two popular Machine Learning (ML) models, Random Forest (RF) and XGBoost showed 98.9% 97.0% and 98.1% OA respectively. Additive exPlanations (SHAP) were used for each model to obtain important features. It was observed that NIR, SWIR1, Blue, and EVI were the most important features. The proposed DNN model outperformed the RF and XGBoost models with these four important features, achieving 98.5% accuracy.

rayyan-220229486,From simple labels to semantic image segmentation: Leveraging citizen science plant photographs for tree species mapping in drone imagery,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract. Knowledge of plant species distributions is essential for various applications, such as nature conservation, agriculture, and forestry. Remote sensing data, especially high-resolution orthoimages from Unoccupied Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), were demonstrated to be an effective data source for plant species mapping. Particularly, in concert with novel pattern recognition methods, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), plant species can be accurately segmented in such high-resolution UAV images. Training such pattern recognition models for species segmentation that are transferable across various landscapes and remote sensing data characteristics often requires excessive training data. Training data are usually derived in the form of segmentation masks from field surveys or visual interpretation of the target species in remote sensing images. Still, both methods are laborious and constrain the training of transferable pattern recognition models. Alternatively, pattern recognition models could be trained on the open knowledge of how plants look as available from smartphone-based species identification apps, that is, millions of citizen science-based smartphone photographs and the corresponding species label. However, these pairs of citizen science-based photographs and simple species labels (one label for the entire image) cannot be used directly for training state-of-the-art segmentation models used for UAV image analysis, which require per-pixel labels for training (also called masks). Here, we overcome the limitation of simple labels of citizen science plant observations with a two-step approach: In the first step, we train CNN-based image classification models using the simple labels and apply them in a moving-window approach over UAV orthoimagery to create segmentation masks. In the second phase, these segmentation masks are used to train state-of-the-art CNN-based image segmentation models with an encoder-decoder structure. We tested the approach on UAV orthoimages acquired in summer and autumn on a test site comprising ten temperate deciduous tree species in varying mixtures. Several tree species could be mapped with surprising accuracy (mean F1-score = 0.47). In homogenous species assemblages, the accuracy increased considerably (mean F1-score 0.55). The results indicate that many tree species can be mapped without generating training data and by integrating pre-existing knowledge from citizen science. Moreover, our analysis revealed that citizen science photographs’ variability in acquisition data and context facilitates the generation of models that are transferable through the vegetation season. Thus, citizen science data may greatly advance our capacity to monitor hundreds of plant species and, thus, Earth's biodiversity across space and time.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-2576,"",,
rayyan-220229508,Improving endangered species assessments using the Automated Probabilistic Co‐Occurrence Assessment Tool,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Under the US Endangered Species Act (ESA), calculating the degree of spatial overlap among endangered species' geographic ranges and registered pesticide use patterns is required and critical to assessing and mitigating potential risks posed to the species in question. However, the dynamic nature of cropping practices, limited data availability for rare species geographic ranges, and the large number of active ingredients and endangered species that must be evaluated can make conducting these co-occurrence analyses challenging and time-consuming. In response to the difficulty of characterizing uncertainty and variability in risk assessments of all types, the National Research Council recommends the use of probabilistic analysis methods (National Research Council, 2013). In the case of endangered species assessments for pesticide registration, researchers have applied probabilistic methods to produce crop footprints (spatial representations of agricultural pesticide use sites), which account for crop rotations and mapping uncertainty (Budreski et al., 2016), and to species distribution models (SDMs) (Phillips et al., 2017), which map variability in habitat quality across species geographic ranges based on species location records and associated environmental data. Research shows that using these probabilistic methods in co-occurrence analyses can yield significantly different results relative to commonly used deterministic methods (Richardson et al., 2022), especially for cases in which probabilistic SDMs identify suitable habitat outside of the previously delineated ranges. Yet, the problem of the large quantity of co-occurrence analyses potentially required for pesticide registration remains and is compounded by the greater effort required to use these probabilistic methods relative to deterministic methods. probabilistic pesticide usage raster data sets (gridded images composed of pixels, in this case measuring 30 m across) that comprise over 90% of cultivated acreage in the continental United States (i.e., soybeans, corn, wheat, cotton, rice, alfalfa); watershed-scale probabilities of pesticide occurrence in aquatic environments; probabilistic SDMs for both terrestrial and aquatic species; and reports on the spatial co-occurrence between pesticide use and species ranges in terrestrial and aquatic environments. Probabilistic pesticide use footprints generated with APCOAT account for variability in cropping practices, uncertainty in crop mapping, and spatial and temporal variability in pesticide usage. Modeling these factors begins with the national probabilistic crop footprint rasters included with APCOAT. In these rasters, cropping practice variability is represented by calculating the probability of crop presence over six years using the USDA Cropland Data Layer (CDL). Uncertainty in crop mapping is also incorporated using the principles of Bayes' Theorem, which is used to update probabilities by incorporating additional evidence. In this case, the additional evidence includes the annual state-level accuracy of the CDL by crop, its agreement with the National Land Cover Database (NLCD), and agreement with crop acreage reported to the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS). Spatial and temporal variability in pesticide usage on these crops is incorporated by using time series of crop acreage derived from the CDL, usage estimates for 452 commonly used pesticides (Wieben, 2019), and pesticide application rates provided by the user to generate state-level statistics of the percent crop treated (PCT). The user may also generate the PCT statistics at the resolution of county or Crop Reporting District if they are able to provide the relevant pesticide usage estimates. Once the PCT statistics are generated, they are applied to the probabilistic crop footprints to yield a probabilistic pesticide use footprint illustrating the probability that each pixel is both cropped and treated with the pesticide. The probabilistic pesticide use footprints can also be used to determine probabilities of pesticide occurrence in aquatic environments. To do so, the mean and maximum values of the probabilistic pesticide use footprint are calculated by subwatershed (Hydrologic Unit Code 12, the most detailed hydrologic units published by the US Geological Survey) and assigned to waterways within the subwatershed. Waterways and waterbodies that receive inflow from neighboring subwatersheds are also assigned the mean and maximum pesticide use probabilities of those larger watersheds to provide both conservative and more realistic estimates. All other waterbodies are assigned the values found within locally delineated watersheds. Probabilistic SDMs are constructed in APCOAT using species location records, environmental variables that may influence species distribution, and the maximum entropy machine learning method implemented by the Maxent software platform (Phillips et al., 2017). The advantages of using APCOAT to run the Maxent platform include the ability to model species in terrestrial and aquatic environments, the availability of prepared environmental predictor variables (e.g., biologically relevant climate averages, land cover, soil texture, stream flow rates), and iterative modeling designed to select the model with the best statistical fit that minimizes the number of included predictor variables. These features permit users to produce probabilistic SDMs by simply providing APCOAT with species location records, available through organizations such as the Global Biodiversity Information Facility, NatureServe, or iNaturalist. By modeling species distributions with these data sets and methods, users can visualize areas of high-quality habitat and potential restoration sites that may not be apparent from critical habitat maps, which may be unavailable for understudied organisms. In the final APCOAT analysis step, spatial co-occurrence between pesticide usage and species of interest is calculated by obtaining the product of their respective probabilistic models. The resulting co-occurrence model is then summarized within zones of interest, and a report is generated detailing the inputs, methods, and results of the co-occurrence analysis. These reports can then be used to rapidly identify organisms requiring higher-tier environmental risk assessments based on the average range-wide probability of co-occurrence or to target areas within the species geographic range for habitat conservation and outreach to pesticide applicators. By making the tools and data described herein publicly available and easily accessible, the barriers to rapidly and accurately assessing the potential spatial co-occurrence between pesticide use and species locations have been reduced significantly. Moreover, the inclusion of tools for aquatic species analyses offers the opportunity for significant expansion in understanding the distributions of the organisms, which have rarely been studied in this manner. APCOAT provides all stakeholders involved in endangered species assessments transparent access to scientific techniques necessary for accurately quantifying the spatial extent and likelihood of pesticide use that could potentially affect threatened and endangered species.

rayyan-220229536,A physics-constrained machine learning method for mapping gapless land surface temperature,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"More accurate, spatio-temporally, and physically consistent LST estimation has been a main interest in Earth system research. Developing physics-driven mechanism models and data-driven machine learning (ML) models are two major paradigms for gapless LST estimation, which have their respective advantages and disadvantages. In this paper, a physics-constrained ML model, which combines the strengths in the mechanism model and ML model, is proposed to generate gapless LST with physical meanings and high accuracy. The hybrid model employs ML as the primary architecture, under which the input variable physical constraints are incorporated to enhance the interpretability and extrapolation ability of the model. Specifically, the light gradient-boosting machine (LGBM) model, which uses only remote sensing data as input, serves as the pure ML model. Physical constraints (PCs) are coupled by further incorporating key Community Land Model (CLM) forcing data (cause) and CLM simulation data (effect) as inputs into the LGBM model. This integration forms the PC-LGBM model, which incorporates surface energy balance (SEB) constraints underlying the data in CLM-LST modeling within a biophysical framework. Compared with a pure physical method and pure ML methods, the PC-LGBM model improves the prediction accuracy and physical interpretability of LST. It also demonstrates a good extrapolation ability for the responses to extreme weather cases, suggesting that the PC-LGBM model enables not only empirical learning from data but also rationally derived from theory. The proposed method represents an innovative way to map accurate and physically interpretable gapless LST, and could provide insights to accelerate knowledge discovery in land surface processes and data mining in geographical parameter estimation.","",https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2307.04817,"",,

Yet, deforestation detection from remote sensing data in this region poses a critical challenge, often hindered by the persistent cloud cover that obscures optical satellite data for much of the year. Addressing this need, this paper proposes three deep-learning models tailored for deforestation monitoring, utilizing SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) multitemporal data moved by its independence on atmospheric conditions. Specifically, the study proposes three novel recurrent fully convolutional network architectures-namely, RRCNN-1, RRCNN-2, and RRCNN-3, crafted to enhance the accuracy of deforestation detection. Additionally, this research explores replacing a bitemporal with multitemporal SAR sequences, motivated by the hypothesis that deforestation signs quickly fade in SAR images over time. A comprehensive assessment of the proposed approaches was conducted using a Sentinel-1 multitemporal sequence from a sample site in the Brazilian rainforest. The experimental analysis confirmed that analyzing a sequence of SAR images over an observation period can reveal deforestation spots undetectable in a pair of images. Notably, experimental results underscored the superiority of the multitemporal approach, yielding approximately a five percent enhancement in F1-Score across all tested network architectures. Particularly the RRCNN-1 achieved the highest accuracy and also boasted half the processing time of its closest counterpart.","",https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2310.05697,"",,

Remote sensing techniques, due to their vast spatial coverage, are proving an essential tool for mapping and analyzing the complex spatial patterns of forests characteristics. In the current study, we use high-resolution Gaofen 1 satellite imagery to map features, such as biomass, biodiversity, and habitat type, of the subtropical forests in the Nanling area, a major biodiversity hot spot in the south of China; for subsequently analyzing the association between forest features and environmental drivers. We based our modeling approach on a semi-supervised fully convolutional neural network consisting of a ResNet architecture and a masking and aggregation module for computing predictions for forest survey plots of varied sizes. The fitted convolutional models yielded very high performance statistics, with test R2 values above 0.90 for basal area, aboveground biomass and Shannon diversity index regressions, slightly lower values for the regression of species richness (R2=0.83), and average test classification accuracy of forest types of 0.89, with lower performance for infrequent forest types, such as dwarf forests. The association analysis between predicted maps of forest features and environmental drivers revealed significant correlations being the strongest drivers the altitude, nitrogen content and climate variables, such as mean annual precipitation and temperature. Altitude was strongly associated with dwarf forests and high basal area and high aboveground biomass locations. Basal area and aboveground biomass were also positively influenced by annual rainfall and soil nitrogen and carbon, and negatively by temperature and radiation variables. Species richness was associated with high nitrogen and carbon contents, while the Shannon diversity index showed overall mild correlations with most drivers, with no remarkable patterns. We concluded that our semi-supervised convolutional approach using Gaofen 1 imagery proved useful for modeling the spatial distribution of the subtropical forests in Nanling; however, more research and data collection is necessary to improve the performance of species richness modeling and segmentation of infrequent forest types. Moreover, the strong associations found between climate, and predicted maps of biomass and forest types, provided key insights into the potential repercussions of climate change on Nanling forests.","",https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-3685695/v1,"",,

It is a cost-effective technique that integrates artificial seedlings and natural regeneration dynamics to enhance forest recovery, mimicking successional processes. Given the current shift of disturbance regimes caused by global change, this technique will likely be a valuable active restoration approach for many forest ecosystems affected by extreme disturbance events. Indeed, AN is suitable for ecological restoration after stand-replacing events, improving seed availability and microsite conditions supporting natural regeneration. AN has been mostly applied in tropical forests, but its use in Mediterranean forests should be increasingly considered since a higher occurrence of large and severe fires has been observed over the last decades and further increases are expected in the future. These changes are raising concerns about regeneration recruitment, particularly for obligate seeders in mountain ecosystems. In these ecosystems, it is crucial to reconsider current post-fire policies to identify strategies that promote and maintain the ecosystem services of degraded forests, particularly when natural regeneration is ineffective.&amp;#160;The main aim of this study was to define the best methodology for implementing AN in a mountain area affected by a large stand-replacing fire that occurred in 2005 in the Aosta Valley Region (North-Western Italy). After the fire salvage logging was performed, increasing ecosystem degradation, and, 16 years later, natural regeneration is still scarce and struggling to settle. Hotspots for AN were identified based on post-fire natural regeneration response to a series of site characteristics, such as topography, fire severity, and distance from seed trees. We assessed the drivers of post-fire regeneration through a machine learning correlative model (Bayesian Regression Tree, BART). The probability of regeneration presence across the landscape was then predicted under the current situation and a set of AN scenarios. Starting from the current scenario, we reclassified the prediction raster into three levels, according to the probability of presence and uncertainty. Polygons with low uncertainty and probability (&lt; 0.3) were included in level one and considered hotspots for AN. From these predictions, it was possible to assess the most efficient active management scenario to speed up the regeneration process. Our results showed that AN could be a promising post-fire management technique for promoting natural regeneration while limiting anthropic interventions and their related economic and ecological costs. &amp;#160;","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu23-11707,"",,

Droughts in Thailand are becoming more severe due to climate change. Developing a reliable Drought Monitoring and Early Warning System (DMEWS) is essential to strengthen a country’s resilience to droughts. However, for a DMEWS to be valuable, the drought indicators it provides stakeholders must have relevance to tangible impacts on the ground. Here, we analyse drought indicator-to-impact relationships in Thailand, using a combination of correlation analysis and machine learning techniques (random forest). In the correlation analysis, we study the link between meteorological drought indicators and high-resolution remote sensing vegetation indices used as proxies for crop-yield and forest-growth impacts. Our analysis shows that this link varies depending on land use, season, and region. The random forest models built to estimate regional crop productivity allow a more in-depth analysis of the crop-/region-specific importance of different drought indicators. The results highlight seasonal patterns of drought vulnerability for individual crops, usually linked to their growing season, although the effects are somewhat attenuated in irrigated regions. Integration of the approaches provides new detailed knowledge of crop-/region-specific indicator-to-impact links, which can form the basis of targeted mitigation actions in an improved DMEWS in Thailand, and could be applied in other parts of Southeast Asia and beyond.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-308,"",,

Already one of the mostly widely distributed wetland plants globally, reed has recently expanded outside of its native range, modifying ecosystems. However, like most wetland plant communities, reedbed has rarely been mapped at large geographical scales, restricting the information available to ecologists and resource managers. Using Sentinel-2 data and machine learning in open-source software, we produce the first remotely-sensed reedbed map of Britain. A random forest was trained on 79.2 ha of reedbed and 2,719.2 ha of non-reedbed land cover, using free online imagery. Accuracy was high within the training area (AUC &gt; 0.998); however, field validation accuracy was much lower (AUC = 0.671), with many false positives (commission error of 93.4%). A similar workflow carried out in Google Earth Engine, using nearly an order of magnitude more images, gave a lower commission error but a disproportionately higher omission error. Due to the classification error, our map is more useful for a non-spatial estimate of the overall reedbed extent in Britain, rather than for the spatial location of reedbeds in Britain. Using the known commission and omission error, we estimate that in 2015 - 2017 c. 7800 ha of Britain was reedbed. Our study highlights the issues that present enduring barriers to accurate land cover classification at large spatial scales, perhaps suggesting fruitful areas for technological innovation. Even with a ‘big data’ approach and even if technological issues are resolved, ecological factors such as confusion land cover types and geographical variation in temporal reflectance function will probably continue to impose upper limits on the size of area for which land cover can be classified accurately, and therefore on the utility of remote sensing to resource managers.","",https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.09.27.559547,"",,

The baseline scenario has been built in the SWAT model, characterising the forest-related parameters, such as the leaf area index, the leaf-to-biomass fraction, the biomass of the forest or the canopy storage among others. This information has been retrieved with land use data, such as the Corine Land Cover, available forest technical map and MODIS satellite images. The following step has been the analysis of multiple land use scenarios to understand the potential effect of different forest management on water-related ecosystem services. Nevertheless, the SWAT model is hugely time-consuming in modelling several land use scenarios, as each forest management strategy needs to be described with a new set of parameters and model runs. For this reason, a Support Vector Machine (SVM) learning model has been trained to reproduce the hydrological behaviour of the Park using the &amp;#160;SWAT model outputs for the baseline scenario as a training dataset. The SVM has been validated with a Jack-Knife cross-validation to test its reliability in determining the average annual water yield, runoff, evapotranspiration and percolation in the river basins using the different forest management types as input. Then, the SVM has been used to model a set of 4200 different land use scenarios to understand the type of forest with the higher water yield content or lower surface runoff. The results show that the oldest forests, especially with a prevalence of oaks, have great potential in regulating services, while the coppices contribute more to the provisioning services.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu23-15446,"",,
rayyan-220229891,Vegetation Health and Forest Canopy Density Monitoring in The Sundarban Region Using Remote Sensing and GIS,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"The present study explores vegetation health and forest canopy density in the Sundarbans region using Landsat-8 images. This work analyzes changes in vegetation health using two vegetation indices, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Forest Canopy Density (FCD) values of the Sundarbans, from 2014 to 2020. NDVI, comprising two bands, Red and Near-infrared (NIR), shows a declining trend during the period. Two NDVI land cover classification maps for 2014 and 2020 are produced, and the interest area is divided into five classes: Scanty, Low, Medium, and Densely Vegetated Regions and Water Bodies. A single-band linear gradient pseudo-color is used to assess the land cover difference between 2020 and 2014, showing marked changes in densely vegetative areas. The NDVI difference marks the coastal regions with a higher depletion rate of vegetation than the regions away from the seacoasts. FCD has been taken to compare the results of NDVI with it. FCD consists of another four models: AVI (advanced vegetative index), BI (Bare soil index), SSI (scaled shadow index), and TI (thermal index). FCD is also called crown cover or canopy coverage, which refers to the portion of an area in the field covered by the crown of trees. 2014 and 2015 FCD maps are produced with a single band linear gradient pseudocolor with five land cover classifications: bare soil, Bare Soil, Shrubs, Low, Medium, and Highly vegetated regions. Both maps bear a significant resemblance to NDVI land classification maps. Further, the FCD values of the two maps are scaled between 1 and 100, and the area of each class is calculated. To check the veracity of the NDVI and FCD analysis, a Deep Neural Network (DNN) model has been developed to classify each year’s image taken from Google Earth Engine (GEE). It classifies each year’s image with 99% accuracy. The calculation of the area of each class emphasizes the rapid decline of densely wooded vegetation. Almost 80% of the highly forested zone has been diminished and has become part of the medium-forested region. Area inflation in medium-forested regions corroborates the same. The study also analyzes the migration of vegetation density, i.e., where and how many areas are unchanged, growing, or deforested.","",https://doi.org/10.47164/ijngc.v14i4.1415,"",,

Starting from a typical “water-polder-village” combination of spatial elements, our study begins by identifying land use in the polder area using Sentinel-2 data and unsupervised machine learning techniques, taking Gaochun District, Nanjing (China), as an example. Next, we conducted a spatial analysis of change for different years using multiple land-use change indices. Finally, geographically weighted regression (GWR) was developed to account for the heterogeneity of spatial patterns and visualize the spatial distributions of the estimated coefficients. The results, derived from the indices we have constructed, indicate that the water-polder-village is the main subject of spatial pattern changes, with spatial replacement of water and polder and incremental quantitative changes in village areas. Additionally, the main source of existing village land comes from the occupation of polders. Furthermore, the impacts of natural and ecological, development and construction, population, and economic factors on the spatial patterns of the polder area exhibit spatiotemporal heterogeneity. Meanwhile, in rapidly developing areas, population, economy, and construction development may negatively impact the protection of polders. The results provide a reference for the construction and protection of production, living, and ecological spaces in polder areas.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/land12091714,"",,
rayyan-220229947,Land Cover Classification in the Antioquia Region of the Tropical Andes Using NICFI Satellite Data Program Imagery and Semantic Segmentation Techniques,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Land cover classification, generated from satellite imagery through semantic segmentation, has become fundamental for monitoring land use and land cover change (LULCC). The tropical Andes territory provides opportunities due to its significance in the provision of ecosystem services. However, the lack of reliable data for this region, coupled with challenges arising from its mountainous topography and diverse ecosystems, hinders the description of its coverage. Therefore, this research proposes the Tropical Andes Land Cover Dataset (TALANDCOVER). It is constructed from three sample strategies: aleatory, minimum 50%, and 70% of representation per class, which address imbalanced geographic data. Additionally, the U-Net deep learning model is applied for enhanced and tailored classification of land covers. Using high-resolution data from the NICFI program, our analysis focuses on the Department of Antioquia in Colombia. The TALANDCOVER dataset, presented in TIF format, comprises multiband R-G-B-NIR images paired with six labels (dense forest, grasslands, heterogeneous agricultural areas, bodies of water, built-up areas, and bare-degraded lands) with an estimated 0.76 F1 score compared to ground truth data by expert knowledge and surpassing the precision of existing global cover maps for the study area. To the best of our knowledge, this work is a pioneer in its release of open-source data for segmenting coverages with pixel-wise labeled NICFI imagery at a 4.77 m resolution. The experiments carried out with the application of the sample strategies and models show F1 score values of 0.70, 0.72, and 0.74 for aleatory, balanced 50%, and balanced 70%, respectively, over the expert segmented sample (ground truth), which suggests that the personalized application of our deep learning model, together with the TALANDCOVER dataset offers different possibilities that facilitate the training of deep architectures for the classification of large-scale covers in complex areas, such as the tropical Andes. This advance has significant potential for decision making, emphasizing sustainable land use and the conservation of natural resources.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/data8120185,"",,
rayyan-220229959,A Characterization of Land-use Changes in the Proximity of Mining Sites in India,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"For a growing economy like India, most of its energy resources are obtained through extractive processes such as mining of coal and other minerals. Mining can however have many negative social and ecological impacts if it is not well regulated. Illegal mining or inadequate reclamation of abandoned mines can amplify these impacts, emphasizing the need to develop methods that can monitor changes in the land-use patterns in and around mining sites. We develop a method using machine learning on freely available satellite data to monitor the extent of mines, and augment it with outputs from land use and land cover classification, deforestation detection, and PM2.5 particulate matter estimation from remote sensing data to track land-use and ecological changes taking place in the proximity of mining sites. We provide evaluation results of our mining delineation classifier, a feasibility check of this suite of tools to monitor mining areas over a period of four years, and a temporal characterization study over 628 mines in India that were granted a clearance for operations during the period 2006 to 2012. We further use this suite of monitoring tools to compare socio-economic development and health indicators across mining and non-mining areas, across various states in India, to study whether extractive processes of mining benefit the immediate population in their neighbourhood.","",https://doi.org/10.1145/3624774,"",,
rayyan-220229982,The Added Value of Remote Sensing Data in Downscaling Regional Climate Models,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Small-scale, subgrid processes on the ice sheets, such as localized surface melt, remain unnoticed by current coarse-resolution Regional Climate Models (RCMs), leading to uncertainties in climate reanalyses and projections. Deep learning allows us to enhance the spatial resolution of RCMs but requires sophisticated model development. Earlier studies have shown that rudimental techniques, such as single-image super-resolution, have failed to capture Antarctic surface melt patterns accurately, because the spatial transferability of these models is low. In this study, we add remote sensing data to a super-resolution model: daily observations of surface albedo from MODIS are used to guide the downscaling of low-resolution surface melt (RACMO2, 27 km) to a high-resolution version (RACMO2, 5.5 km) for a 20-year period, between 2001-2019. We extend a conventional SRResNet and add the MODIS data in different configurations (i.e., spatial-channel communication, content communication, and empirical-physical activation). The models are trained over the Antarctic Peninsula, for which RACMO2 simulations are available at 5.5 km resolution (Van Wessem et al., 2016). We verify the performance of the models with three independent datasets to inspect (1) the overall performance (using QuickSCAT); (2) spatial patterns (using Sentinel-1); and (3) temporal patterns (using automatic weather stations). Our work shows the potential of adding remote sensing data to deep learning-based downscaling models, leading to improved spatial transferability compared to single-image downscaling models.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu23-12927,"",,
rayyan-220230066,A Hybrid Deep Neural Operator/Finite Element Method for Ice-Sheet Modeling,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"One of the most challenging and consequential problems in climate modeling is to provide probabilistic projections of sea level rise. A large part of the uncertainty of sea level projections is due to uncertainty in ice sheet dynamics. At the moment, accurate quantification of the uncertainty is hindered by the cost of ice sheet computational models. In this work, we develop a hybrid approach to approximate existing ice sheet computational models at a fraction of their cost. Our approach consists of replacing the finite element model for the momentum equations for the ice velocity, the most expensive part of an ice sheet model, with a Deep Operator Network, while retaining a classic finite element discretization for the evolution of the ice thickness. We show that the resulting hybrid model is very accurate and it is an order of magnitude faster than the traditional finite element model. Further, a distinctive feature of the proposed model compared to other neural network approaches, is that it can handle high-dimensional parameter spaces (parameter fields) such as the basal friction at the bed of the glacier, and can therefore be used for generating samples for uncertainty quantification. We study the impact of hyper-parameters, number of unknowns and correlation length of the parameter distribution on the training and accuracy of the Deep Operator Network on a synthetic ice sheet model. We then target the evolution of the Humboldt glacier in Greenland and show that our hybrid model can provide accurate statistics of the glacier mass loss and can be effectively used to accelerate the quantification of uncertainty.","",https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2301.11402,"",,

rayyan-220230161,Root zone soil moisture estimation over China,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Root zone soil moisture (RZSM) refers to the water available to plants.Compared to surface soil moisture, RZSM plays a more crucial role in various applications such as agricultural monitoring, drought and flood forecasting, water supply management, land-atmosphere feedbacks, and the hydrologic response of watersheds.There are three commonly used methods to estimate RZSM.The first method involves in-situ soil moisture sensors.However, field measurements are only representative of a small spatial scale, which limits their applications.The second method is based on surface soil moisture (SSM).Microwave remote sensors are effective for measuring the global distribution of SSM.However, due to the limitation of microwave depth signal penetration, RZSM cannot be obtained based on it.Since SSM is closely related to RZSM through the diffusion process, some methods have been developed to estimate RZSM from SSM.For instance, the exponential filter (EF) method uses a simplified two-layer water balance approach to establish the relationship between SSM and RZSM (Albergel et al., 2008).Data-driven methods use SSM, meteorological data, land surface conditions, and soil properties as drivers to build machine learning models to estimate RZSM.The third method for obtaining RZSM involves modeling approaches that combine climate models or land surface models with data assimilation techniques.RZSM reanalysis data products such as ERA5, MERRA2, and CFSR rely on this method.Similarly, the RZSM products of SMAP level 4 and GLDAS are also model-based.However, large errors usually exist in the RZSM simulations due to uncertainties in model parameters and forcings (Xu).This study first evaluates seven RZSM products, including ERA5, MERRA2, CFSR, SMAP level 4, GLDAS_NOAH2.1,GLDAS_Catchment2.2, and SMOS CATDS Level 4, using 1153 ground sites across China.Then, a data fusion method is developed based on machine learning method to integrate the seven RZSM products to produce a more accurate RZSM dataset.The evaluation results show that MERRA2 and NOAH had the best performance, with MERRA2 better able to capture surplus and deficit soil moisture conditions.The study also revealed that precipitation forcing plays a vital role in improving RZSM simulations.Conversely, ERA5 overestimates RZSM, and SMOS exhibits a dry bias.From the time series variability, all datasets except SMOS can capture the temporal dynamics of RZSM well.Moreover, the accuracy of the RZSM products varies significantly in tropical climate zones.The newly developed dataset is better than a single RZSM product with five-fold cross-validation.This study provides crucial insights for improving land surface and hydrological models in estimating RZSM, and proposes an approach to promoting the accuracy of RZSM estimation by maximizing the utilization of existing RZSM products, which is very helpful in drought management and agricultural production.","",https://doi.org/10.36334/modsim.2023.tian218,"",,

Since forest cover evolves due to land use change, climate and extreme events, understanding its past dynamics becomes crucial in a changing climate context. In this work we analyze historical aerial imagery acquired in Switzerland since 1946 [2] for high-resolution forest mapping. We focus on the 1500&amp;#8211;2500m a.s.l. altitude range in the Valais and Vaud Alps, where agricultural land abandonment and climate change have caused forest cover changes.The times series are composed of single-band, panchromatic images until year 1998, then RGB images up to the year 2020, the last acquisition date over our study area. As a reference for the forest cover in 2020, we use the Topographic Landscape Model SwissTLM3D [1]. For previous years, we plan to manually generate labels to evaluate our results.We frame forest mapping as a multi-temporal semantic segmentation task: given a time series of images, we predict a map for each imageattributing every pixel to the class ""forest"" or ""non-forest"". To solve this task, we develop a deep learning model composed of:a segmentation module, trained with the images and labels from the year 2020; a temporal module, which takes consecutive features generated by the segmentation module and outputs a multi-temporal segmentation map. This module is trained using a Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss enforcing temporal consistency. We analyze predictions obtained with three models, each one containing one or two of the modules described above. We observe that using the full spectral information of the input images leads to a better delineation of forest borders for both old and recent images (Table 1, Figure 1).

The ever-accelerating dynamics and disturbance regime in forests, driven by climate change and land use changes, significantly alter the forest landscape. Remote sensing has revolutionized forest research, serving as a versatile tool for the comprehensive analysis of Earth's landscapes across varying spatial and temporal scales. The integration of remote sensing data with on-site inventory information within spatio-temporal models further enhances our comprehension of forest dynamics and observations. Within this thesis, by synergistically combining established methodologies with cutting-edge advancements, we discuss and compare several approaches for a more effective study of the environment within diverse spatial scales. Firstly, this thesis analyses forest resources assessment at a local scale within a managed Pinus sylvestris area. Through the fusion of LiDAR metrics and field data, we compare area-based approach and Universal Kriging, testing lognormal variable transformation. The results show how spatial correlation between variables can improve the modelling of forest structural variables. Transitioning to a regional perspective, our attention turns to the study of the montane-subalpine ecotone dynamics in the eastern Spanish Pyrenees. Combining periodic field inventory data and the consistent temporal coverage of Landsat imagery, we aim to enrich our comprehension of silver fir (Abies alba Mill) and mountain pine (Pinus uncinata Ramond.) dynamics driven by the global change. By generating image composites and classifying designated target species, we reconstruct more than twenty years of changes in species distribution within these mountainous forests, showing an upward shift of silver fir-mountain pine ecotone triggered by forestry activities cessation. Lastly, our scope broadens to a national scale to produce a comprehensive forest disturbance map covering the entire country. The 3I3D method proves to be a valuable asset in identifying areas of disturbance, as demonstrated through its successful application and testing within a Mediterranean context. From these, we meticulously derive a disturbance dataset through photointerpretation, which serves as the foundation for training our subsequent classification model where the identified disturbed regions are further categorized into prevalent disturbance types, including fires, clear-cutting and thinning. Different machine learning classification techniques were tested, with Random Forest yielding the most accurate results. This innovative approach has provided a methodology capable of generating annual disturbance maps, a pivotal undertaking in a landscape marked by shifting climatic conditions and evolving land-use patterns. In summary, within this thesis, we propose accurate and reproducible approaches, ranging from modelling of forest structure at a management unit scale to mapping of forest disturbances at a national scale, providing methodologies to be further applied by forest managers. RESUMEN El seguimiento y evaluación forestal requieren del desarrollo de métodos innovadores que sean eficientes y precisos para la estimación de las variables y recursos forestales. El cambio climático junto con los cambios en el uso del suelo ha alterado significativamente el paisaje forestal, modificando la dinámica y el régimen de perturbaciones en los bosques. Hoy en día son múltiples los estudios y procedimientos que, mediante el uso de teledetección, desarrollan y simplifican el estudio de los procesos forestales. La teledetección ha revolucionado la investigación forestal, sirviendo como una herramienta versátil para el análisis integral de los ecosistemas bajo diversas escalas espaciales y temporales. La integración de datos de teledetección con datos de inventarios forestales mediante modelos espacio-temporales favorece nuestra comprensión de la dinámica y estructura forestal. Esta tesis aborda y compara varios enfoques aplicados al estudio forestal, empleando métodos geoestadísticos y de teledetección, además de proponer procedimientos innovadores para un mejor conocimiento de nuestro entorno bajo diversas escalas espaciales. Inicialmente nos centramos en una escala local para evaluar los recursos forestales dentro de un área gestionada de Pinus sylvestris. Mediante combinación de datos LiDAR y datos de campo, comparamos dos enfoques: el area-base approach y el Universal Kriging aplicando transformaciones lognormales a las variables. Los resultados muestran cómo la correlación espacial entre variables mejora la modelización de la estructura forestal. Ampliando la perspectiva a una escala regional, nos centramos en el estudio de la dinámica del ecotono montano-subalpino en los Pirineos orientales españoles. Nuestro objetivo es comprender la dinámica del abeto (Abies alba Mill) y el pino negro (Pinus uncinata Ramond) impulsada por el cambio global mediante la combinación de datos periódicos de inventario forestal y la amplia cobertura temporal que proporciona la colección Landsat. Mediante el uso de compuestos de imágenes y aplicando métodos de clasificación de especies, reconstruimos cambios en la distribución de especies en esta área durante más de dos décadas mostrando un ascenso del ecotono abeto-pino negro desencadenado por el abandono de los aprovechamientos forestales. Por último, llevamos a cabo un estudio a nivel nacional con el objetivo de generar un mapa de perturbaciones. El método 3I3D, previamente desarrollado y validado en regiones de clima mediterráneo, ha demostrado su eficacia en la identificación de áreas de perturbación. Aplicando esta herramienta y apoyándonos en la fotointerpretación, entrenamos nuestro modelo de clasificación en las áreas identificadas como perturbadas, principalmente debido a incendios, cortas y clareos. Evaluamos varias clasificaciones y observamos que Random Forest obtuvo los mejores resultados. Esta metodología podrá ser aplicada para la generación de mapas anuales de perturbaciones, de gran importancia para la gestión en un contexto de cambio climático y cambio de uso del suelo. En resumen, dentro de esta tesis proponemos enfoques precisos y reproducibles, que van desde el modelado de la estructura forestal a escala de unidad de gestión hasta el mapeo nacional de las perturbaciones forestales, proporcionando metodologías que puedan ser aplicadas por gestores forestales.","",https://doi.org/10.20868/upm.thesis.80717,"",,
rayyan-220230321,Deep artificial intelligence applications for natural disaster management systems: A methodological review,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Deep learning techniques through semantic segmentation networks have been widely used for natural disaster analysis and response. The underlying base of these implementations relies on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that can accurately and precisely identify and locate the respective areas of interest within satellite imagery or other forms of remote sensing data, thereby assisting in disaster evaluation, rescue planning, and restoration endeavours. Most CNN-based deep-learning models encounter challenges related to the loss of spatial information and insufficient feature representation. This issue can be attributed to their suboptimal design of the layers that capture multiscale-context information and their failure to include optimal semantic information during the pooling procedures. In the early layers of CNNs, the network encodes elementary semantic representations, such as edges and corners, whereas, as the network progresses toward the later layers, it encodes more intricate semantic characteristics, such as complicated geometric shapes. In theory, it is advantageous for a segmentation network to extract features from several levels of semantic representation. This is because segmentation networks generally yield improved results when both simple and intricate feature maps are employed together. This study comprehensively reviews current developments in deep learning methodologies employed to segment remote sensing images associated with natural disasters. Several popular deep learning models, such as SegNet U-Net, FCNs, FCDenseNet, PSPNet, HRNet, and DeepLab, have exhibited notable achievements in various applications, including forest fire delineation, flood mapping, and earthquake damage assessment. These models demonstrate a high level of efficacy in distinguishing between different land cover types, detecting infrastructure that has been compromised or damaged, and identifying regions that are fire-susceptible to further dangers.","",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2024.112067,"",,

The proposed method was shown effective in the following aspects: (1) identification of land use variation, (2) simulation of future land use change distribution, and (3) analysis of the contribution of different driving factors to LUCC. The approach was applied to the city of Dongguan. The land use patterns changed in a balanced manner, according to the movement distances of gravity center during 2010–2020. Compared with the land use pattern in 2020, the area of ecological land was projected to diminish by 0.67 %, 1.42 %, and 2.07 % in 2025, 2030, and 2035, respectively. Based on the simulation and prediction of the land-use areas in Dongguan, the area of woodland would reduce by 7.42 %, and the growth rate of building land would be slow. It was recommended that a conservation district should be established, especially in the central mountainous region of Dongguan.","",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.indic.2024.100355,"",,

However, human activities and climate change have significantly degraded the wetland ecosystem in recent decades in the YRD. Therefore, an understanding of the land use modifications is essential for the efficient management and preservation of ecosystems in this region. This study utilized time series of remote sensing data and the extreme gradient boosting method to generate land use maps of the YRD from 2000 to 2020. Several methods, including transition matrix, land use dynamic degree, and standard deviation ellipse, were employed to explore the characteristics of land use transitions. The results underscore significant spatial variations in land use over the past two decades. The most rapid increase was observed in built-up area, followed by terrestrial water and tidal flats, while unutilized land experienced the fastest decrease, followed by forest–grassland. The spatial distribution patterns of agricultural land, built-up area, terrestrial water, and forest–grassland demonstrated stronger directionality compared to other land use types. The wetlands have expanded in size and improved in structure. Unutilized land has been converted into artificial wetlands comprising ponds, reservoirs, salt ponds, shrimp and crab ponds, and natural wetlands featuring mudflats and forest–grassland. The wetland conservation efforts after 2008 have proven very effective, playing a positive role in ecological and environmental preservation, as well as in regional sustainable development.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/rs16111946,"",,

This paper provides a comprehensive review of deep learning methodologies applied to deforestation analysis through satellite imagery. In the face of deforestation’s ecological repercussions, the need for advanced monitoring and surveillance tools becomes evident. Remote sensing, with its capacity to capture extensive spatial data, combined with deep learning’s prowess in recognizing complex patterns to enable precise deforestation assessment. Integration of these technologies through state-of-the-art models, including U-Net, DeepLab V3, ResNet, SegNet, and FCN, has enhanced the accuracy and efficiency in detecting deforestation patterns. The review underscores the pivotal role of satellite imagery in capturing spatial information and highlights the strengths of various deep learning architectures in deforestation analysis.

Artificial intelligence-based models are a promising alternative to the most common direct ETa estimation techniques and indirect methods by remote sensing (RS)-based surface energy balance models. Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are proven to be suitable for predicting reference evapotranspiration (ETo) and ETa based on RS data. This study aims to develop a methodology based on ANNs for estimating daily ETa values using NDVI and land surface temperature, coupled with limited site-specific climatic variables in a large irrigation catchment. The ANN model has been applied to the two different scenarios. Data from only the 38 days of satellite overpass dates was selected in Scenario I, while in Scenario II all datasets, i.e., the 769-day data were used. An irrigation scheme, located in the Mediterranean region of Turkiye, was selected, and a total of 38 Landsat images and local climatic data collected in 2021 and 2022 were used in the ANN model. The ETa results by the ANN model for Scenarios I and II showed that the R2 values for training (0.79 and 0.86), testing (0.75 and 0.81), and the entire dataset (0.76 and 0.84) were all remarkably high. Moreover, the results of the new ANN model in two scenarios showed an acceptable agreement with ETa-METRIC values. The proposed ANN model demonstrated the potential for obtaining daily ETa using limited climatic data and RS imagery. As a result, the suggested ANN model for daily ETa computation offers a trustworthy way to determine crop water usage in real time for sustainable water management in agriculture. It may also be used to assess how crop evapotranspiration in drought-prone areas will be affected by climate change in the 21st century.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/su16062481,"",,

We summarize commonly used DL architectures for spatiotemporal forecasting in ESS, key technical innovations, and the latest advancements in spatiotemporal predictive applications. While DL architectures have proven capable of handling spatiotemporal data, challenges remain in tackling the complexities specific to ESS, such as complex spatiotemporal data, scale dependencies, model interpretability, and integration of physical knowledge. Recent innovations demonstrate growing efforts to integrate physical knowledge, improve model explainability, adapt DL architectures for domain-specific needs, and quantify uncertainties.

To improve LULCC prediction, this study proposes the use of a random forest regression (RFR) model, in comparison with logistic regression–cellular automata (LR-CA) and artificial neural network–cellular automata (ANN-CA), for the prediction of LULCC (2019–2030) in the Gaborone dam catchment (Botswana). RFR is proposed as it is able to capture the existing and potential interactions between the LULC intensity and their nonlinear interactions with the change-driving factors. For LULCC forecasting, the driving factors comprised physiographic variables (elevation, slope and aspect) and proximity-neighborhood factors (distances to water bodies, roads and urban areas). In simulating the historical LULC (1986–2019) at 5-year time steps, RFR outperformed ANN-CA and LR-CA models with respective percentage accuracies of 84.9%, 62.1% and 60.7%. Using the RFR model, the predicted LULCCs were determined as vegetation (−8.9%), bare soil (+8.9%), built-up (+2.49%) and cropland (−2.8%), with water bodies exhibiting insignificant change. The correlation between land use (built-up areas) and water depicted an increasing population against decreasing dam water capacity. The study approach has the potential for deriving the catchment land–water nexus, which can aid in the formulation of sustainable catchment monitoring and development strategies.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/su16041699,"",,

Despite the increasing use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to acquire high-resolution data for vegetation analysis in Antarctic regions through artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, the use of multispectral imagery and deep learning (DL) is quite limited. This study addresses this gap with two pivotal contributions: (1) it underscores the potential of deep learning (DL) in a field with notably limited implementations for these datasets; and (2) it introduces an innovative workflow that compares the performance between two supervised machine learning (ML) classifiers: Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and U-Net. The proposed workflow is validated by detecting and mapping moss and lichen using data collected in the highly biodiverse Antarctic Specially Protected Area (ASPA) 135, situated near Casey Station, between January and February 2023. The implemented ML models were trained against five classes: Healthy Moss, Stressed Moss, Moribund Moss, Lichen, and Non-vegetated. In the development of the U-Net model, two methods were applied: Method (1) which utilised the original labelled data as those used for XGBoost; and Method (2) which incorporated XGBoost predictions as additional input to that version of U-Net. Results indicate that XGBoost demonstrated robust performance, exceeding 85% in key metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score. The workflow suggested enhanced accuracy in the classification outputs for U-Net, as Method 2 demonstrated a substantial increase in precision, recall and F1-score compared to Method 1, with notable improvements such as precision for Healthy Moss (Method 2: 94% vs. Method 1: 74%) and recall for Stressed Moss (Method 2: 86% vs. Method 1: 69%).

In this study, we employed Deep Learning classifiers and Random Forest to classify land cover/land use in Czechia, adhering to LULUCF regulations. We evaluated the effectiveness of 2D and 3D Convolutions in Convolutional Neural Networks, with varying filter sizes and training methods, alongside the use of Random Forest classifier.

Deep Learning (DL) models, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs), have become popular for change detection tasks, including the deforestation mapping application. However, not enough attention has been paid to the domain shift issue, which affects classification performance when pre-trained models are used in areas with different forest covers and deforestation practices. This study compares DL methods for deforestation detection, focusing on assessing how well CNNs and ViTs can adapt to the domain shift. Two different models, namely, DeepLabv3+ and UNETR, were trained using remote sensing images and references from a specific location and then tested in other sites to simulate real-world scenarios. The results showed that the ViT-based architecture achieved better performance when trained and tested in the same region but showed lower generalization capacity in cross-domain scenarios. We consider this a work in progress that needs further research to confirm its findings, with the evaluation of additional architectures on a wider range of domains.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/isprs-archives-xlviii-3-2024-519-2024,"",,

Millions of kilometers of unmapped roads have challenged environmental governance and conservation in remote frontiers. Prior attempts to map roads at large scales have proven inefficient, incomplete, and unamenable to continuous road monitoring. Recent developments in automated road detection using artificial intelligence have been promising but have neglected the relatively irregular, sparse, rustic roadways characteristic of remote semi-natural areas. In response, we tested the accuracy of automated approaches to large-scale road mapping across remote rural and semi-forested areas of equatorial Asia-Pacific. Three machine learning models based on convolutional neural networks (UNet and two ResNet variants) were trained on road data derived from visual interpretations of freely available high-resolution satellite imagery. The models mapped roads with appreciable accuracies, with F1 scores of 72–81% and intersection over union scores of 43–58%. These results, as well as the purposeful simplicity and availability of our input data, support the possibility of concerted program of exhaustive, automated road mapping and monitoring across large, remote, tropical areas threatened by human encroachment.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/rs16050839,"",,

In this paper, we use object-orientated modeling to construct a model that combines Markov models, neural networks, and cellular automata. We extend the Markov model to the traditional CA, fully utilizing the advantage of ANN in simplifying the definition of land use transformation rules and obtaining a large number of spatial variable parameters of the model. This successfully simplifies the structure of the model and the definition of transformation rules. We apply the constructed Ann-CA-Markov land use change analysis model to the evolution and prediction of land use in County A. It has been found that the proportion of arable land area in County A decreased from 23.3% to 12.1%, and the proportion of construction land increased from 28.07% to 50.87%. From 2000 to 2020, other land continued to converge into construction land in large quantities, so the land area of County A increased from 1224.73km² to 1295.15km² in 2020. The area of arable land converted out is the largest among the five types of land, with an arable land area of only 308.11km² by 2020. The probability of conversion of four land types, namely, arable land, forest land, grassland, and watershed, to construction land is 21.7%, 10.5%, 10.9%, and 9.2%, respectively, by 2030, while the probability of conversion of construction land to arable land is 21.7%, 10.5%, 10.9%, and 9.2%, respectively. The probability of converting land to cropland is 13.9%.

For the ecosystem and for our varied needs, forests are essential. They provide everyone on the planet with gasoline, food, and medical supplies. These days, deforestation is one of the world's most pressing issues. It has negligible effects on the climate and ecology. Since the 1960s, more than half of the tropical forests on Earth have been destroyed. Deforestation early detection has become important. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are used in deforestation detection to determine the extent of deforestation by using pre- and post- deforestation satellite images as input. Globally, large- scale deforestation results in substantial losses. The rate of deforestation worldwide is approximately 10 million hectares of forest every year. Since 1990, the area covered by primary forests worldwide has decreased by more than 80 million hectares. For a variety of causes, people have cleared woods. Urbanization, mining, illegal logging, and agricultural growth are a few of the factors that continue to fuel deforestation worldwide. Systems based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Data Augmentation, Geospatial Analysis and Post-processing Techniques which could involve filtering out small isolated detections, smoothing boundaries, or incorporating contextual information to improve the overall accuracy of deforestation identification have been developed by numerous researchers.

rayyan-220230542,Climate change effects on animal presence in the Massaciuccoli Lake basin,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Big-data mining approaches based on Artificial Intelligence models can help forecast biodiversity changes before they happen. These approaches can predict macroscopic species distribution patterns and trends that can inform preventive measures to avoid the loss of ecosystem functions and services. They can, therefore, help study and mitigate climate change implications on biodiversity conservation in fragile ecosystems. Wetlands are particularly fragile ecosystems where climate change poses severe risks and has dramatically reduced their size over the past century, with profound consequences on biodiversity and ecosystem services. Through big-data mining approaches, we can predict future wetland biodiversity trends in the context of climate change. This paper proposes such predictive analysis for a specific wetland: The Massaciuccoli Lake basin in Tuscany, Italy. This basin is a critical tourist attraction due to its rich biodiversity, making it an area of interest for citizens, tourists, and scientists. However, the region's suitability for native and non-native species is at risk due to climate and land-use change. Using machine-learning models, we predict the potential effects of climate change on animal spatial distribution in the basin under different greenhouse gas emission scenarios. The results suggest that habitat suitability has generally improved from 1950 to today, presumably owing to the targeted conservation strategies adopted in the area, but climate change will severely reduce bird biodiversity by 2050 while favouring several insect species' proliferation and other species' habitat change, even under a medium-emission scenario. This will lead to significant changes in the basin's biodiversity. Our methodology is adaptable to other wetland basins, being fully based on open data and models.

It is highly productive agriculturally, but highly vulnerable to hydroclimatic shocks. A principal means of improving systemwide water management flexibility is strategic land fallowing. To date, however, land fallowing is sporadic, ephemeral, and unpredictable. Understanding patterns and drivers of land fallowing would allow resource managers to better plan for water allocation to cities, farms, and ecosystems. The inability to accurately anticipate the distribution of fallow land hampers the optimization of resource use, thereby affecting both the agricultural economy and regional water management. Thus, forecasting fallow land would allow for more optimum agricultural productivity and water delivery, particularly to vulnerable communities and ecosystems. To address this issue, this study compares state-of-the-art machine learning models with deep learning methods using a rich dataset that includes satellite images, weather patterns, soil properties, historical land use information, and other pertinent geospatial data. We employ an advanced ensemble of machine learning algorithms, i.e., Random Forest (RF), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and Support Vector Machines (SVM), for forecasting fallow land. Additionally, we investigate the use of Convolutional and Recurrent Neural Networks (like ConvLSTM, CNN-LSTM, and GAN) to take advantage of the spatial and temporal relationships contained in the data. Our preliminary findings suggest that deep learning models, with their capacity to capture intricate spatial and temporal correlations within the data, may perform better than more conventional machine learning techniques. As a result, these deep learning models could help water managers, policymakers, and researchers make more precise forecasts about the distribution of fallow land, leading to more optimal use of water resources and agricultural output. The results of this study can not only offer insights for California water managers and policymakers, but also enable practical plans for more optimal resource allocation, sustainable agricultural land use, and long-term water security.

Regrettably, a substantial 64% –71% of wetlands have been lost worldwide since 1900, mainly due to changes in land use and land cover (LULC). This issue is not unique to Zambia's Bangweulu Wetland System (BWS), which faces similar challenges. However, there is limited information about the LULC changes in BWS. Furthermore, finding accurate and cost-effective methods to understand LULC dynamics is complicated by the multitude of available techniques for LULC classification. Non-parametric methods like Machine Learning (ML) offer greater accuracy, but different ML models come with distinct strengths and weaknesses. Combining multiple models has the potential to create a more precise LULC classification model. Open-source software like QGIS and spatial data like Landsat also play a significant role in this endeavour. The primary objective of this study was to enhance the accuracy of modeling LULC changes in wetland areas. Six ML models: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naive Bayes (NB), Decision Tree (DT), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Random Forest (RF), and K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) were used for LULC image classification of Landsat 8 (2020 image) and Landsat 5 (1990, 2000, and 2010 images) in QGIS. Four models: SVM, NB, DT, and KNN, performed better than the other models. Consequently, The Quad (4) hybrid model was created by fusing the maps from these four models with the highest performance. Results revealed that the fusion of the four classified maps of the SVM, NB, DT, and KNN (Quad hybrid model) showcased superior performance compared to the individual models with Kappa Index scores of 0.87, 0.72, 0.84 and 0.87 for the years 1990, 2000, 2010 and 2020, respectively. The analysis of the LULC changes from 1990 to 2020 showed a yearly decline of -1.17%, -1.01%, and -0.12% in forest, grassland, and water body coverage, respectively. In contrast, built-up areas and cropland increased at rates of 1.70% and 2.70%, respectively. This study underscores the consistent growth of cropland and built-up areas from 1990 to 2020, alongside the reduction of forest cover and grassland. Although the water body experienced a gradual decrease over this period, the decline was minimal. Long-term monitoring will be essential for evaluating the success of interventions, guiding conservation efforts, mitigating negative impacts on the wetland ecosystem, and determining whether the reduction in water bodies is a sustained trend or a short-term phenomenon.","",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envc.2024.100866,"",,

Resistance to pests, diseases, and extreme weather events are among the most critical characteristics of resilient cities, closely related to species richness and, consequently, to the diversity of street trees. However, urban forest inventories are currently scarce worldwide. For this reason, urban trees' biodiversity and capacity to provide these ecosystem services are not developed enough. Three state-of-the-art species identification applications were tested, Plant.id, Pl@ntNet and Seek (iNaturalist) to identify a large number of tree families, genera, and species automatically. Two individual Google Street View images were queried for each tree in the study area, adjusting the Field of View and pitch parameters. The predictive capacity of the three apps was compared, and a biodiversity analysis was performed for different geospatial scales within the study area (i.e., at the whole study area, neighborhood, and street levels, respectively). Notably, our research contributes in an innovative way to the assessment and monitoring of the ecosystem services provided by street trees and sheds light on the great potential of combining remote sensing, citizen science and artificial intelligence for urban forest biodiversity assessments at multiple spatial and temporal scales.","",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jag.2024.103735,"",,

In this study, we used Unmanned Aerial Vehicles to gather RGB images of mid-to-high-altitude ecosystems in the Zao mountains (Japan). All the data-collection missions took place in autumn so the plants present distinctive seasonal coloration. Patches from single trees and bushes were manually extracted from the collected orthomosaics. Subsequently, Deep Learning image-classification networks were used to automatically determine the species of each tree or bush and estimate biodiversity. Both Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformer-based models were considered (ResNet, RegNet, ConvNeXt, and SwinTransformer). To measure and estimate biodiversity, we relied on the Gini–Simpson Index, the Shannon–Wiener Index, and Species Richness. We present two separate scenarios for evaluating the readiness of the technology for practical use: the first scenario uses a subset of the data with five species and a testing set that has a very similar percentage of each species to those present in the training set. The models studied reach very high performances with over 99 Accuracy and 98 F1 Score (the harmonic mean of Precision and Recall) for image classification and biodiversity estimates under 1% error. The second scenario uses the full dataset with nine species and large variations in class balance between the training and testing datasets, which is often the case in practical use situations. The results in this case remained fairly high for Accuracy at 90.64% but dropped to 51.77% for F1 Score. The relatively low F1 Score value is partly due to a small number of misclassifications having a disproportionate impact in the final measure, but still, the large difference between the Accuracy and F1 Score highlights the complexity of finely evaluating the classification results of Deep Learning Networks. Even in this very challenging scenario, the biodiversity estimation remained with relatively small (6–14%) errors for the most detailed indices, showcasing the readiness of the technology for practical use.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/rs16193654,"",,
rayyan-220230664,Predicting the Impact of Extreme Weather on Agricultural Losses in the Delmarva Peninsula using Multi-Step Machine Learning and Financial Crop Loss Data,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"<title>Abstract</title> The increasing occurrence of extreme weather events due to climate change presents significant challenges for agricultural production. Existing research on climatic impacts to agriculture has predominantly focused on changes in yield for major crops, providing limited insights into overall losses and impacts on diverse regional agricultural systems. This study addresses this gap by using financial crop loss data and crop insurance payouts to gain a more comprehensive understanding of agricultural impacts in diverse agricultural regions. To address the irregular data structure of financial loss data, we developed multi-step machine learning models to quantify the relationship between weather-related financial crop loss and contributing climatic factors. The Delmarva Peninsula in the Eastern United States is used as a case study location to demonstrate this methodology over the period from 1980 to 2018. Multi-step configurations of linear regression, random forest, and support vector machine approaches are compared in terms of their classification and estimation accuracy using a repeated hold-out cross-validation analysis. Results indicate that machine learning methods, particularly random forest, outperform both statistical approaches and our null baseline model, demonstrating superior generalizability in agricultural damage estimation. Multistep configurations that address irregular data distributions are shown to have a significant influence on models' capacity to detect and estimate damage occurrence. The study reveals a preference for simpler modeling approaches that minimize variance in handling unseen data, as well as the importance of accounting for seasonal patterns, spatial groupings, and persistent weather phenomena in accurately estimating agricultural losses.","",https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-5398230/v1,"",,

These impacts have consequences for societies and human well-being, especially in Africa. Historically, efforts have focused on assessing global change from a social or biophysical perspective, treating them as separate entities. Yet, our understanding of impacts to social-ecological systems remains limited, particularly in the Global South, due to a lack of data, tools, and approaches accounting for social and ecological aspects of ecosystem services. This is especially relevant for cultural ecosystem services as they are less tangible. We use a simple indicator and important provider of a multitude of cultural ecosystem services, birding, to understand how climate, biodiversity, and land use change will impact cultural ecosystem services across Africa. We explore how emerging tools and data can overcome limitations in mapping and modeling cultural ecosystem services, particularly in analyzing human preferences and behavior at large spatiotemporal scales and in data-poor regions. Leveraging crowdsourced data from eBird and using machine learning techniques we map and model recreational birding to assess the underlying social-ecological relationships and the impact of future climate and environmental change. We show that bird species richness, protected areas, accessibility, and max temperature contribute most to birding suitability across the continent. Further, we show spatial shifts in the suitability of birding under three future climate scenarios (SSP126, 370, and 585). Models suggest climate and biodiversity change will increasingly constrain the flow of birding related cultural ecosystem services across Africa. This has implications for human-nature interactions, development of countries, management of protected areas, and overall human well-being in the future. More generally, we highlight opportunities for crowdsourced datasets and machine learning to integrate non-material ecosystem services in models and thus, enhance the understanding of future impacts to ecosystem services and human well-being.","",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.170872,"",,

In this paper, a wildfire spatial prediction model based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) was constructed in the reference period (1997–2014) by using wildfire driving factors and historical burned areas derived from the Global Fire Emissions Database (GFED4s). The shifting spatial patterns of global burned areas in future scenarios for the twenty‐first century was investigated by using shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs) published by CMIP6. Projected burned areas are analyzed by using nine climate models from CMIP6 under four SSPs (SSP126, SSP245, SSP370 and SSP585) for four defined periods. The evolution of the spatial pattern of global wildfires was further described based on terrestrial ecoregions and GFED regions. The results showed that for the reference period (1997–2014), burned areas were generally distributed in tropical and subtropical regions. The projection results exhibited a systematic increasing trend under the four SSPs from a global perspective in response to climate warming. The increasing trend for the burned area in the SSP370 and SSP585 scenarios was more obvious than that for the SSP126 and SSP245 scenarios. As the severity of the emission scenarios increases, severe wildfires will gradually shift to higher latitudes in the mid‐to‐long term (2061–2080) and long term (2081–2100).","",https://doi.org/10.1029/2023ef004088,"",,

This has led to habitat loss, reducing biodiversity, depleting biomass, and increasing CO2 emissions. In this study, we employed an artificial neural network, field data, and remote sensing techniques to develop a model for estimating biomass in the remaining native vegetation within an 18,864 km2 ecotone region between the Amazon and Cerrado biomes in the state of Mato Grosso, Brazil. We utilized field data from a plant ecology laboratory and vegetation indices from Sentinel-2 satellite imagery and trained artificial neural networks to estimate aboveground biomass (AGB) in the study area. The optimal network was chosen based on graphical analysis, mean estimation errors, and correlation coefficients. We validated our chosen network using both a Student’s t-test and the aggregated difference. Our results using an artificial neural network, in combination with vegetation indices such as AFRI (Aerosol Free Vegetation Index), EVI (Enhanced Vegetation Index), and GNDVI (Green Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), which show an accurate estimation of aboveground forest biomass (Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 15.92%), can bolster efforts to assess biomass and carbon stocks.

In this study, we aimed to develop an open-sourced and user-friendly online system for monitoring large-scale deforestation on high-resolution remote sensing imageries, named OpenForestMonitor. The OpenForestMonitor system was the first online deforestation detection system developed for highresolution remote sensing imageries with deep learning methods. To validate the performance of the OpenForestMonitor system, we selected four large-scale study areas in China as the study areas, and they are Liuyang City, Cangwu County, Sanya City, and Xianyang City. The final experiment results indicated that the F1-score of these study areas is 0.719, 0.854, 0.792, and 0.650, respectively.

Despite the availability of machine-learning techniques for estimating soil moisture from high-resolution remote-sensing imagery, including synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data and optical remote sensing, comprehensive comparative studies of these techniques remain limited. This paper addresses this gap by systematically comparing the performance of four tree-based ensemble-learning models (random forest (RF), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), light gradient-boosting machine (LightGBM), and category boosting (CatBoost)) and three deep-learning models (deep neural network (DNN), convolutional neural network (CNN), and gated recurrent unit (GRU)) in terms of soil moisture estimation. Additionally, we introduce and evaluate the effectiveness of four different stacking methods for model fusion, an approach that is relatively novel in this context. Moreover, Sentinel-1 C-band dual-polarization SAR and Sentinel-2 multispectral data, as well as NASADEM and geographical code and temporal code features, are used as input variables to retrieve the soil moisture in the ShanDian River Basin in China. Our findings reveal that the tree-based ensemble-learning models outperform the deep-learning models, with LightGBM being the best individual model, while the stacking approach can further enhance the accuracy and robustness of soil moisture estimation. Moreover, the stacking all boosting classes ensemble-learning model (SABM), which integrates only boosting-type models, demonstrates superior accuracy and robustness in soil moisture estimation. The SHAP value analysis reveals that ensemble learning can utilize more complex features than deep learning.

Many ecosystem services depend on biodiversity and influence crop yield and quality. In viticulture, the importance of groundcover management, as cover crops or spontaneous grassing, is particularly important for the conservation of biodiversity and consequently, the preservation of ecosystem services. The integration of remote sensing technologies and artificial intelligence in this context remains limited, especially concerning groundcover classification in viticulture. In response to this challenge, our research focuses on developing a methodology for the identification and classification of groundcovers within vineyards inter-row. Employing an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle, equipped with RGB cameras, and advanced deep learning models, we categorize groundcovers into nine classes of which seven distinct cover crop communities groups. Our study aims to establish a method for identifying vineyard inter-row groundcover, with the ultimate goal of creating a comprehensive groundcover map.

This complexity presents an immense challenge in predicting the course of forest fire spread. Traditional methods of forest fire spread prediction are constrained by their ability to process multidimensional fire-related data, particularly in the integration of spatiotemporal information. To address these limitations and enhance the accuracy of forest fire spread prediction, we proposed the AutoST-Net model. This innovative encoder–decoder architecture combines a three-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (3DCNN) with a transformer to effectively capture the dynamic local and global spatiotemporal features of forest fire spread. The model also features a specially designed attention mechanism that works to increase predictive precision.

rayyan-220230751,AI-based Validation of Deforestation Using High-Resolution Satellite Imagery in the Brazilian Amazon,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract. Forests play an important role in the Earth systems for carbon sequestration and climate change mitigation, yet they have been increasingly disturbed by deforestation and forest degradation at an unprecedented pace. The Brazilian Amazon, for instance, experienced a 140% rise in deforestation from 2012 to 2020, with a record loss of 13,200 km2 between August 2020 and July 2021. Alarmingly, 87% of 2019 deforestation alerts occurred on private properties, with 61% in legally restricted areas. Existing deforestation monitoring systems, such as PRODES and the Global Forest Change dataset, use about 30m resolution satellite imagery, which is insufficient for operational validation at fine scales. The Deforestation Alert System by Imazon leverages high-resolution PlanetScope data (3-4m) but faces challenges due to fewer spectral bands and variations in reflectance values across different satellite sensors and dates. As a result, current validation is based mainly on manual inspection which is highly time-consuming. To address the challenges and automate the validation process, this work develops a system based on deep learning – known for its ability to capture complex texture patterns in high-resolution images – to inspect and confirm new deforestation sites. Specifically, the system takes inputs from potential deforestation sites suggested by coarse-resolution products and uses a pair of PlanetScope images before and after the change at each site to determine new deforestation (excluding existing deforestation). Our results demonstrate that the new system achieves robust and high-quality accuracy under various test conditions.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/isprs-archives-xlviii-3-2024-583-2024,"",,

Accordingly, this study investigated whether large-scale biodiversity monitoring campaigns such as the European Monitoring of Biodiversity in Agricultural Landscapes (EMBAL) could be supported by the use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) based remote sensing and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). For this purpose, the Structural Nature Value (SNV) indicator was proposed, which allows an intuitive estimation of the species richness of landscape sections. Subsequently, a CNN was trained to directly predict the SNV. For the accuracy assessment, a survey was conducted in which participants were asked to assess the SNV for various landscape patches, both to obtain an independent test set, and to evaluate the intuitiveness of the concept. The CNN achieved a mean weighted F1-score of 0.81 with an overall accuracy of 81 %. It was shown that the CNN can provide promising results to not only aid large-scale biodiversity monitorings, but to enhance the quality of their results through the automated analysis of fine-resolution UAV imagery.","",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rsase.2024.101235,"",,

The data for pre- and post-policy implementation is necessary to assess the specific policy's impact on land use. In the early nineties, Germany started promoting renewable energy production, including bioenergy, which changed the agricultural landscape. Remote sensing (RS) image-based machine learning models can be beneficial for mapping agricultural land use in the present and the past. However, machine learning classification models trained on RS data from specific training sites and time may not be able to predict data for unknown sites and unknown temporal points due to changes in crop phenology, field features, or ecological site circumstances because most of the models are limited in their performances according to variations of the training data set. Therefore, this study aims to assess the spatial–temporal transferability of Landsat-based agricultural land use type classification. The study was developed to map agricultural land cover (5 classes: maize, grasslands, summer crops, winter crops, and mixed crops) in two regions in Germany (North Hesse and Weser-Ems) between the years 2010 and 2018 using Landsat archive data (i.e., Landsat 5, 7, and 8). Two machine learning models (random forest − RF and 2D convolution neural network – 2DCNN) were trained and evaluated according to no transferability (reference) scenario and three spatial–temporal scenarios using mF1 and class level F1 values. Three model transferability scenarios were evaluated: a) temporal – S1, b) spatial – S2, and c) spatiotemporal – S3. The reference scenario, without transferability, achieved an overall accuracy of 89.1% and a macro F1 score of 0.74 for RF and 89.9% and 0.75 for CNN, respectively. Under three transferability scenarios (S1, S2, and S3), the macro F1 scores decreased to 0.67, 0.66, and 0.62 for RF, and 0.68, 0.62, and 0.58 for CNN, respectively. The dissimilarity between the data employed to train the model and data from the new domain indicated a clear link that could explain the reduction in model predictability. Moreover, the performance degradation could be attributed to the disparity in environmental, climatic, and crop calendar conditions between the two domains. Understanding the extent of model performance degradation during transferability is crucial for developing effective strategies to mitigate these issues and enhance the generalisability of machine learning models for agriculture land cover mapping.","",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2024.05.020,"",,

In contrast, for the literature on RS and ML it identified five thematic clusters: spatial forestry analysis, hyperspectral soil analysis, agricultural deep learning, the multitemporal imaging of farmland SOC, and RS platforms (Sentinel-2 and synthetic aperture radar, SAR). From 1991 to 2023, research on SOC estimation using RS and ML has evolved from basic mapping to topics like carbon sequestration and modeling with Sentinel-2A and big data. In summary, this study traces the historical growth and thematic evolution of SOC research, identifying synergies between RS and ML and focusing on SOC estimation with advanced ML techniques. These findings are critical to global ecosystem SOC assessments and environmental policy formulation.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/rs16173168,"",,
rayyan-220230875,Cognitive land cover mapping: A three-layer deep learning architecture for remote sensing data classification,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"In many application domains, remotely sensed (RS) data are essential for disaster monitoring, climate forecasting, and remote surveillance. It perceives and gathers environmental, sociological, and transitional data on its own, from a distance, in increasing amounts of spatial and temporal details. While urbanization has been continued to be a worldwide phenomenon, the urban management and planning are needed to satisfy the needs of the Earth system. The operations associated with land management, urban planning, and transportation on Earth have been connected to digital maps and geographic databases. Knowledge of land cover is also significant for managing, conserving, and formulating environmental and urban development policies. Therefore, highly accurate Land Use Land Cover (LULC) assessment and monitoring are of the utmost significance for empirical studies and organizational accomplishment. In this study, we leverage remotely sensed data to formulate a sophisticated deep learning system for comprehensive Earth observation. The core of our approach involves the development of a three-layered Convolution-Convolution-Maxpooling Convolutional Neural Network (CCMCNN) model, preceded by a meticulous pre-processing stage. In the pre-processing stage, images extracted from the NWPU-RESISC dataset undergo resizing, division, and augmentation procedures before being fed into the three-layered CCMCNN architecture for the purpose of classifying them into five different LULC categories. The effectiveness of our proposed model undergoes thorough validation through a comparative examination against various pre-trained deep learning models outlined in existing literature. Presenting performance metrics, our model attains a remarkable accuracy rate of 98.4%.

Near- real-time changes of forest land use are mapped at 0.05 ha minimum mapping unit for all forest types across the Earth’s ecoregions, every two weeks. LUCA is based on Sentinel-1 cloud penetrating synthetic aperture radar (SAR) observations to circumvent limitations of optical imagery from pervasive cloud cover over forested areas globally, and especially in the tropics. The methodology is based on a combination of time-series change detection and machine learning analytics to achieve high accuracy of alerts across all ecoregions and landscapes globally with an average area-adjusted users and producers accuracy of 83% and 63%, respectively. The bi-weekly global alert maps capture forest clearing associated with deforestation and industrial timber harvesting, along with forest degradation associated with selective logging, fragmentation, fire, and roads. The product was developed and released publicly through Google Earth Engine to allow for the rapid assessment of land use change activities, quantifying patterns and processes driving forest change and dynamics across forest ecoregions. LUCA is designed to help monitor a variety of emission reduction programs at the local to regional scales and play a key role in implementing regulations on deforestation-free products.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/rs16122151,"",,

Therefore, the principal goal of this study is to isolate the effects of anticipated climate and land-use changes on streamflow at the Indus River, Besham, Pakistan, using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). The multimodal ensemble (MME) of 11 general circulation models (GCMs) under two shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs) 245 and 585 was computed using the Taylor skill score (TSS) and rating metric (RM). Future land use was predicted using the cellular automata artificial neural network (CA-ANN). The impacts of climate change and land-use change were assessed on streamflow under various SSPs and land-use scenarios. To calibrate and validate the SWAT model, the historical record (1991–2013) was divided into the following two parts: calibration (1991–2006) and validation (2007–2013). The SWAT model performed well in simulating streamflow with NSE, R 2 , and RSR values during the calibration and validation phases, which are 0.77, 0.79, and 0.48 and 0.76, 0.78, and 0.49, respectively. The results show that climate change (97.47%) has a greater effect on river runoff than land-use change (2.53%). Moreover, the impact of SSP585 (5.84%–19.42%) is higher than that of SSP245 (1.58%–4%). The computed impacts of climate and land-use changes are recommended to be incorporated into water policies to bring sustainability to the water environment.","",https://doi.org/10.3389/fenvs.2024.1338512,"",,

Yet, evaluating agriculture's hydrological impacts and strategies to reduce them remains challenging due to a lack of field-scale data on crop water consumption. Here, we develop a method to fill this gap using remote sensing and machine learning, and leverage it to assess water saving strategies in California's Central Valley. We find that switching to lower water intensity crops can reduce consumption by up to 93%, but this requires adopting uncommon crop types. Northern counties have substantially lower irrigation efficiencies than southern counties, suggesting another potential source of water savings. Other practices that do not alter land cover can save up to 11% of water consumption. These results reveal diverse approaches for achieving sustainable water use, emphasizing the potential of sub-field scale crop water consumption maps to guide water management in California and beyond.","",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-46031-2,"",,

The Geospatial Water Erosion Prediction Project (GeoWEPP) was used to assess LULC and climate changes’ impact on runoff, soil loss, and sediment yield. The QGIS 2.16.3 plugin module for land use change evaluation (MOLUSCE) tool with the cellular automata artificial neural network (CA-ANN) was used for LULC prediction based on historical data and exploratory maps. Two commonly used representative concentration pathways (RCPs)—4.5 and 8.5—were used for climate projection in the 2030s, 2050s, and 2070s. The LULC prediction analysis showed an expansion of cropland and settlement areas, with the reduction in the forest and rangelands. The climate projections indicated an increase in maximum temperatures and altered precipitation patterns, particularly with increased wet months and reduced dry periods. The average annual soil loss and sediment yield rates were estimated to increase under both the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 climate scenarios, with a more noticeable increase under RCP8.5. By integrating DEM, soil, land use, and climate data, we evaluated runoff, soil loss, and sediment yield changes on only land use/cover, only climate, and the combined impacts in the watershed. The results revealed that, under all combined scenarios, the sediment yield in the Megech Reservoir was projected to substantially increase by 23.28–41.01%, showing a potential loss of reservoir capacity. This study recommends strong climate adaptation and mitigation measures to alleviate the impact on land and water resources.

Climate change is expected to lead to increasingly extreme weather conditions, which may even increase the frequency and extent of these inundations. Shallow “floods”, also defined as inland excess water, are phenomena that occur due to a complex set of interrelated factors. Our research presents a workflow based on active and passive satellite data from Sentinel-1 and -2, combined with a large auxiliary data set to detect and predict these floods. The workflow uses convolutional neural networks to classify water bodies based on Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellite data. The inundation data were complimented with meteorological, soil, land use, and GIS data to form 24 features that were used to train an XGBoost model and a deep neural network to predict future inundations, with a daily interval. The best prediction was reached with the XGBoost model, with an overall accuracy of 86%, a Kappa value of 0.71, and an F1 score of 0.86. The SHAP explainable AI method showed that the most important input features were the amount of water detected in the satellite imagery during the week before the forecast and during the period two weeks earlier, the number of water pixels in the surroundings on the day before the forecast, and the potential evapotranspiration on the day of the forecast.

However, quantifying and predicting wild mushroom yields is challenging due to spatial and temporal variability. In Mediterranean forests, climate-change-induced droughts further impact mushroom production. Fungal fruiting is influenced by factors such as climate, soil, topography, and forest structure. This study aims to quantify and predict the mycological potential of Lactarius deliciosus in sustainably managed Mediterranean pine forests using machine learning models. We utilize a long-term dataset of Lactarius deliciosus yields from 17 Pinus pinaster plots in Soria, Spain, integrating forest-derived structural data, NASA Landsat mission vegetation indices, and climatic data. The resulting multisource database facilitates the creation of a two-stage ‘mycological exploitability’ index, crucial for incorporating anticipated mycological production into sustainable forest management, in line with what is usually done for other uses such as timber or game. Various Machine Learning (ML) techniques, such as classification trees, random forest, linear and radial support vector machine, and neural networks, were employed to construct models for classification and prediction. The sample was always divided into training and validation sets (70-30%), while the differences were found in terms of Overall Accuracy (OA). Neural networks, incorporating critical variables like climatic data (precipitation in January and humidity in November), remote sensing indices (Enhanced Vegetation Index, Green Normalization Difference Vegetation Index), and structural forest variables (mean height, site index and basal area), produced the most accurate and unbiased models (OAtraining = 0.8398; OAvalidation = 0.7190). This research emphasizes the importance of considering a diverse array of ecosystem variables for quantifying wild mushroom yields and underscores the pivotal role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools and remotely sensed observations in modeling non-wood forest products.

Using a multidisciplinary approach, a novel remote sensing-based urban ecological condition index (RSUSEI) will be developed and applied to assess the ecological status of urban surfaces. Therefore, the identification and quantification of urbanisation is important. To do so, we used hyper-tuned artificial neural network (ANN) as well as Land Cover Change Rate (LCCR), Land Cover Index (LCI) and Landscape Expansion Index (LEI). For the development of (RSUSEI), we have used four advanced models such as fuzzy Logic, Principle Component Analysis (PCA), Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) and fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process (FAHP) to integrate various ecological parameters. In order to obtain more information for better decision making in urban planning, sensitivity and uncertainty analyses based on a deep neural network (DNN) were also used. The results of the study show a multi-layered pattern of urbanisation in Saudi Arabian cities reflected in the LCCR, indicating rapid urban expansion, especially in the built-up areas with an LCCR of 0.112 over the 30-year period, corresponding to a more than four-fold increase in urban land cover. At the same time, the LCI shows a remarkable increase in 'built-up' areas from 3.217% to 13.982%, reflecting the substantial conversion of other land cover types to urban uses. Furthermore, the LEI emphasises the complexity of urban growth. Outward expansion (118.98 km2), Edge-Expansion (95.22 km2) and Infilling (5.00 km2) together paint a picture of a city expanding outwards while filling gaps in the existing urban fabric. The RSUSEI model shows that the zone of extremely poor ecological condition covers an area of 157–250 km2, while the natural zone covers 91–410 km2. The DNN based sensitivity analysis is useful to determine the optimal model, while the integrated models have lower input parameter uncertainty than other models. The results of the study have significant implications for the management of urban ecosystems in arid areas and the protection of natural habitats while improving the quality of life of urban residents. The RSUSEI model can be used effectively to assess urban surface ecology and inform urban management techniques.","",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2024.e25731,"",,

Although these wetlands play key roles in sequestering carbon (C) in the lithosphere and hydrosphere, there is a notable dearth of comprehensive yet spatially explicit accounts of their total blue carbon (TBC) stocks. The anthropogenic factors including development stressors have fundamentally altered the global C dynamics. In this respect, holistic accounting of the total C stocks of the coastal wetlands becomes the foremost task in emphasizing their recognition as integral components of climate change mitigation strategies. This study modeled TBC stocks of an intertidal mudflat of eastern India across different land use/ land covers (LULCs) by quantifying the above ground biomass (AGB), below ground biomass (BGB), and soil organic C (SOC). The distribution of SOC was modeled through spatial interpolation of point-specific C densities (R2 = 0.77; RMSE = 22.91 Mg ha−1). AGB was estimated by establishing allometric relationships between geospatial data, both of active (PALSAR-2) and passive (Pleiades-1B) nature and in-situ dendrometric variables using the artificial neural network (R2 = 0.85; RMSE = 48.91 Mg ha−1). BGB was estimated from the modeled AGB. Spatial integration of these datasets estimated the TBC stock of mudflat as 27,469.30 Mg. Overall, open mangrove represented highest mean TBC density (163.29 Mg ha−1) while herbaceous vegetation recorded largest TBC stock (9818.94 Mg). Mean TBC densities across LULCs were significantly different (p < 0.05) from each other except for the herbaceous vegetation and built-up categories, indicating the inertial effects of paleo-land covers. Accordingly, this study could be inferred as a pioneering one in developing a comprehensive geospatial model of TBC accounting in India towards strengthening the regional and national C inventories.","",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoinf.2024.102509,"",,

To improve carbon stock monitoring and evaluation of fine-scale forest loss, we developed a rapid, automatic, scalable, and cost-efficient generalized deep learning framework that uses diverse remote sensing data and satellite imagery to derive aboveground carbon density from accurate estimates of tree canopy heights at fine-grained resolution (30x30 meters) in remote tropical rainforests.

Therefore, evaluating the performance of different precipitation products becomes very important. Here, the annual and daily average precipitation data from different precipitation products in China were analyzed from 2000 to 2020. Nine precipitation datasets are included: two reanalysis datasets and seven remote sensing datasets. The results show that CHIRPS (Climate Hazards group Infrared Precipitation with Stations) is the best product for precipitation in arid and semiarid China, and the mean annual precipitation correlation coefficient between CHIRPS and observed data is 0.82.

In addition, the performance of precipitation products is tailored to local conditions, with MSWEP (Multi-source weighted-Ensemble Precipitation) evaluating precipitation poorly in Northwestern China but better in the areas with more precipitation. Extreme precipitation in China has shown an increasing trend in the last 20 years, with a very significant increasing trend in extreme precipitation in semi-arid areas and a constant trend in extreme precipitation in arid areas.

Utilizing convolutional neural networks alongside satellite imagery analysis, we have mapped and quantified the changes in land use and cover, revealing significant trends and transformations within the peninsula&amp;#039;s landscape. The research aims to elucidate the interplay between anthropogenic activities, climatic variations, and policy interventions in shaping land cover dynamics, thereby providing insights into the environmental and socio-economic impacts of these changes. Our findings indicate a marked increase in urban expansion at the expense of natural ecosystems, including forests and wetlands, underscoring the urgent need for sustainable land management strategies. The study highlights the role of agricultural intensification and expansion in altering the peninsula&amp;#039;s ecological balance and emphasizes the critical importance of integrating change analysis and prediction. By leveraging advanced remote sensing and GIS technologies, our analysis not only enhances the understanding of the complex dynamics driving land use and land cover change but also showcases the potential of predictive modeling in forecasting future land cover scenarios.

rayyan-220231116,Extraction of Water Bodies from High-Resolution Aerial and Satellite Images Using Visual Foundation Models,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Water, indispensable for life and central to ecosystems, human activities, and climate dynamics, requires rapid and accurate monitoring. This is vital for sustaining ecosystems, enhancing human welfare, and effectively managing land, water, and biodiversity on both the local and global level. In the rapidly evolving domain of remote sensing and deep learning, this study focuses on water body extraction and classification through the use of recent deep learning models of visual foundation models (VFMs). Specifically, the Segment Anything Model (SAM) and Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) models have shown promise in semantic segmentation, dataset creation, change detection, and instance segmentation tasks. A novel two-step approach involving segmenting images via the Automatic Mask Generator method of the SAM and the zero-shot classification of segments using CLIP is proposed, and its effectiveness is tested on water body extraction problems. The proposed methodology was applied to both remote sensing imagery acquired from LANDSAT 8 OLI and very high-resolution aerial imagery. Results revealed that the proposed methodology accurately delineated water bodies across complex environmental conditions, achieving a mean intersection over union (IoU) of 94.41% and an F1 score of 96.97% for satellite imagery. Similarly, for the aerial imagery dataset, the proposed methodology achieved a mean IoU of 90.83% and an F1 score exceeding 94.56%. The high accuracy achieved in selecting segments predominantly classified as water highlights the effectiveness of the proposed model in intricate environmental image analysis.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/su16072995,"",,
rayyan-220231121,From simple labels to semantic image segmentation: leveraging citizen science plant photographs for tree species mapping in drone imagery,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract. Knowledge of plant species distributions is essential for various application fields, such as nature conservation, agriculture, and forestry. Remote sensing data, especially high-resolution orthoimages from unoccupied aerial vehicles (UAVs), paired with novel pattern-recognition methods, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), enable accurate mapping (segmentation) of plant species. Training transferable pattern-recognition models for species segmentation across diverse landscapes and data characteristics typically requires extensive training data. Training data are usually derived from labor-intensive field surveys or visual interpretation of remote sensing images. Alternatively, pattern-recognition models could be trained more efficiently with plant photos and labels from citizen science platforms, which include millions of crowd-sourced smartphone photos and the corresponding species labels. However, these pairs of citizen-science-based photographs and simple species labels (one label for the entire image) cannot be used directly for training state-of-the-art segmentation models used for UAV image analysis, which require per-pixel labels for training (also called masks). Here, we overcome the limitation of simple labels of citizen science plant observations with a two-step approach. In the first step, we train CNN-based image classification models using the simple labels and apply them in a moving-window approach over UAV orthoimagery to create segmentation masks. In the second phase, these segmentation masks are used to train state-of-the-art CNN-based image segmentation models with an encoder–decoder structure. We tested the approach on UAV orthoimages acquired in summer and autumn at a test site comprising 10 temperate deciduous tree species in varying mixtures. Several tree species could be mapped with surprising accuracy (mean F1 score =0.47). In homogenous species assemblages, the accuracy increased considerably (mean F1 score =0.55). The results indicate that several tree species can be mapped without generating new training data and by only using preexisting knowledge from citizen science. Moreover, our analysis revealed that the variability in citizen science photographs, with respect to acquisition data and context, facilitates the generation of models that are transferable through the vegetation season. Thus, citizen science data may greatly advance our capacity to monitor hundreds of plant species and, thus, Earth's biodiversity across space and time.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-21-2909-2024,"",,
rayyan-220231126,The Potential of Remote Sensing for Enhancing a Sustainable Agricultural Intensification under a Changing Climate in West Africa,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"The challenges of climate change in West Africa are closely linked to food security in the region. Rising temperatures and increasingly variable precipitation threaten traditional rain-fed agriculture relying on the rainy season. Climate change is affecting the rainy season in West Africa in multiple ways, e.g., by shifting the onset, shortening its duration and increasingly interrupting the growing period by dry spells. An increase of extreme weather events such as heavy precipitation or storms add another risk to agriculture. The risk of crop failures hits an already vulnerable system. Since a large portion of food is imported the West African countries are vulnerable to external economic shocks. Furthermore, West Africa has one of the highest population growth rates in the world, its population will increase to 1.2 billion people by 2050. To guarantee sufficient food supply and to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), a sustainable intensification of agriculture is needed (i.e., increasing yields without additional land consumption and without adverse effects on climate change) and mitigation and adaption strategies against the negative effects of climate change are required. Remote sensing has proven to be a suitable instrument to measure and evaluate both, mitigation and adaptation actions in a reliable and cost-effective way. Depending on the method of cultivation, agriculture causes different amounts of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Remote sensing can provide information about biophysical development as input and reference data for land surface models to assess the produced GHG under different cultivation practices. Since the negative impact of climate change on agriculture is already measurable and visible, adaptation measures are highly important. They differ in terms of their complexity, their technical feasibility and their costs. Adaptation measures can be for example a change in land management, the choice of crop variety or technical innovation like weather forecast or irrigation systems. In various interdisciplinary research projects (CONCERT, COINS, AgRAIN), we selected adaptation measures of varying complexity and monitor and evaluate them using remote sensing-based analysis, mainly on Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2 and Planet data. The analyses range from land cover and land use mapping to crop classification, crop suitability modeling, field boundary delineation, identification of management events, and site-specific productivity measurements. We employ a range of methodologies, including random forest regression, convolutional neural networks (CNN), fuzzy logic approaches, and time series analysis. The results serve as a basis for local stakeholders and decision-makers, enabling the implementation of proven adaption measures to enhance resilience against climate change and promote sustainable agricultural intensification.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu24-16115,"",,
rayyan-220231143,Coupling the remote sensing data-enhanced SWAT model with the bidirectional long short-term memory model to improve daily streamflow simulations,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Global climate change has led to an increase in the frequency and scale of extreme weather events worldwide, and there is an urgent need to develop better-performing hydrological models to improve the accuracy of streamflow simulations and to facilitate water resource planning and management. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) has a notable physical foundation and is widely used in hydrological research. However, it uses a simplified vegetation growth model, introducing uncertainty into the simulation results. This study focused on improving the model based on remotely sensed phenological and leaf area index (LAI) data. Phenological data were used to define vegetation dormancy, and the LAI data replaced the corresponding data simulated by the original model. This approach improved the accuracy of the model in describing vegetation dynamics. Then, the enhanced SWAT model was coupled with the bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) model to validate the simulation of hydrological processes upstream of the Hei River. During model validation, the performance of the enhanced SWAT model in simulating streamflow (R2 = 0.835, NSE = 0.819) was better than that of the original SWAT model (R2 = 0.821, NSE = 0.805). In terms of simulating evapotranspiration, the enhanced SWAT model demonstrated even greater advantages. During the verification period, compared to those of the SWAT model, the R2 and NSE values of the enhanced SWAT model for daily-scale simulations increased from 0.196 and −0.269 to 0.777 and 0.732, respectively. The R2 and NSE values for monthly-scale simulations increased from 0.782 and 0.678 to 0.906 and 0.851, respectively. Simultaneously, the performance levels of two coupling approaches in streamflow prediction were compared, i.e., direct coupling of the original SWAT and BiLSTM models (SWAT-BiLSTM) and coupling of the enhanced SWAT and BiLSTM models (enhanced SWAT-BiLSTM). The results showed that the enhanced SWAT-BiLSTM model always performed better than the SWAT-BiLSTM model during the entire simulation period, especially the enhanced SWAT-BiLSTM model, which could more accurately predict peak streamflow changes. This study demonstrated that coupling an improved physical model with deep learning models could improve the streamflow prediction accuracy.","",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2024.131117,"",,
rayyan-220231170,A deep learning approach for high‐resolution mapping of Scottish peatland degradation,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract Peat makes up approximately a quarter of Scotland's soil by area. Healthy, undisturbed, peatland habitats are critical to providing resilient biodiversity and habitat support, water management, and carbon sequestration. A high and stable water table is a prerequisite to maintain carbon sink function; any drainage turns this major terrestrial carbon store into a source that feeds back further to global climate change. Drainage and erosion features are crucial indicators of peatland condition and are key for estimating national greenhouse gas emissions. Previous work on mapping peat depth and condition in Scotland has provided maps with reasonable accuracy at 100‐m resolution, allowing land managers and policymakers to both plan and manage these soils and to work towards identifying priority peat sites for restoration. However, the spatial variability of the surface condition is much finer than this scale, limiting the ability to inventory greenhouse gas emissions or develop site‐specific restoration and management plans. This work involves an updated set of mapping using high‐resolution (25 cm) aerial imagery, which provides the ability to identify and segment individual drainage channels and erosion features. Combining this imagery with a classical deep learning‐based segmentation model enables high spatial resolution, national scale mapping to be carried out allowing for a deeper understanding of Scotland's peatland resource and which will enable various future analyses using these data.","",https://doi.org/10.1111/ejss.13538,"",,
rayyan-220231189,Global 1 km land surface parameters for kilometer-scale Earth system modeling,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract. Earth system models (ESMs) are progressively advancing towards the kilometer scale (“k-scale”). However, the surface parameters for land surface models (LSMs) within ESMs running at the k-scale are typically derived from coarse-resolution and outdated datasets. This study aims to develop a new set of global land surface parameters with a resolution of 1 km for multiple years from 2001 to 2020, utilizing the latest and most accurate available datasets. Specifically, the datasets consist of parameters related to land use and land cover, vegetation, soil, and topography. Differences between the newly developed 1 km land surface parameters and conventional parameters emphasize their potential for higher accuracy due to the incorporation of the most advanced and latest data sources. To demonstrate the capability of these new parameters, we conducted 1 km resolution simulations using the E3SM Land Model version 2 (ELM2) over the contiguous United States. Our results demonstrate that land surface parameters contribute to significant spatial heterogeneity in ELM2 simulations of soil moisture, latent heat, emitted longwave radiation, and absorbed shortwave radiation. On average, about 31 % to 54 % of spatial information is lost by upscaling the 1 km ELM2 simulations to a 12 km resolution. Using eXplainable Machine Learning (XML) methods, the influential factors driving the spatial variability and spatial information loss of ELM2 simulations were identified, highlighting the substantial impact of the spatial variability and information loss of various land surface parameters, as well as the mean climate conditions. The comparison against four benchmark datasets indicates that ELM generally performs well in simulating soil moisture and surface energy fluxes. The new land surface parameters are tailored to meet the emerging needs of k-scale LSM and ESM modeling with significant implications for advancing our understanding of water, carbon, and energy cycles under global change. The 1 km land surface parameters are publicly available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10815170 (Li et al., 2024).","",https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-16-2007-2024,"",,
rayyan-220231200,Examining the effect of urbanization on various land cover classes and environmental quality using remote sensing and GIS methods,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract It is vital for public awareness and decision-makers to investigate the impact caused by changes in urban land use and land cover on ecosystem service values (ESVs) in order to promote sustainable urban development, protect the environment, protect public health, and ensure communities’ long-term well-being. Changes in ecosystem services brought on by changes in land use and cover (LULC) are a crucial early indicator and warning sign of ecological shifts. Using remote sensing and GIS tools, this study examined the shifting dynamics of ESVs in the Haridwar district in Uttarakhand state, India. The evaluation of land use land cover (LULC) changes was carried out by analyzing satellite images of the research region from 2001 to 2021. In addition, we examined changes in ecosystem services according to the study area’s LULC classifications. Using a random forest machine learning classifier, satellite images were classified into five categories of land cover: water bodies, forests, built-up areas, agricultural land, and bare land. The findings showed that from 2001 to 2021, forest cover and water bodies fell by 15.35% and 41.50%, respectively, while urban area and agricultural area rose by 69.24% and 12.31%, respectively. Due to increased urbanization and degradation of water bodies and forest areas, ESV fell from 103.19 USD ha −1 year −1 in 2001 to 70.53 USD ha −1 year −1 in 2021. The combination of LULC with the value of ecosystem services may improve our knowledge of several difficulties in an urban ecosystem. As a result, we advocate for the incorporation of LULC and ESVs as a tool that might be useful to urban planners and land managers in the future for sustainable development of natural resources.","",https://doi.org/10.1088/2631-8695/ad5c2c,"",,

Recent shifts in climate patterns and intensified human–forest interactions have led to an increase in the incidence of wildfires. These fires are characterized by their extensive coverage, higher frequency, and prolonged duration, rendering them increasingly destructive. To mitigate the impact of wildfires on climate change, ecosystems, and biodiversity, it is imperative to conduct systematic monitoring of wildfire progression and evaluate their environmental repercussions on a global scale. Satellite remote sensing is a powerful tool, offering precise and timely data on terrestrial changes, and has been extensively utilized for wildfire identification, tracking, and impact assessment at both local and regional levels. The Canada Centre for Mapping and Earth Observation, in collaboration with the Canadian Forest Service, has developed a comprehensive National Burned Area Composite (NBAC). This composite serves as a benchmark for curating a bi-temporal multi-source satellite image dataset for change detection, compiled from the archives of Sentinel-2, Sentinel-1, and ALOS-2 PALSAR-2. To our knowledge, this dataset is the inaugural large-scale, multi-source, and multi-frequency satellite image dataset with 20 m spatial resolution for wildfire mapping, monitoring, and evaluation. It harbors significant potential for enhancing wildfire management strategies, building upon the profound advancements in deep learning that have contributed to the field of remote sensing. Based on our curated dataset, which encompasses major wildfire events in Canada, we conducted a systematic evaluation of the capability of multi-source satellite earth observation data in identifying wildfire-burned areas using statistical analysis and deep learning. Our analysis compares the difference between burned and unburned areas using post-event observation solely or bi-temporal (pre- and post-event) observations across diverse land cover types. We demonstrate that optical satellite data yield higher separability than C-Band and L-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), which exhibit considerable overlap in burned and unburned sample distribution, as evidenced by SAR-based boxplots. With U-Net, we further explore how different input channels influence the detection accuracy. Our findings reveal that deep neural networks enhance SAR’s performance in mapping burned areas. Notably, C-Band SAR shows a higher dependency on pre-event data than L-Band SAR for effective detection. A comparative analysis of U-Net and its variants indicates that U-Net works best with single-sensor data, while the late fusion architecture marginally surpasses others in the fusion of optical and SAR data. Accuracy across sensors is highest in closed forests, with sequentially lower performance in open forests, shrubs, and grasslands. Future work will extend the data from both spatial and temporal dimensions to encompass varied vegetation types and climate zones, furthering our understanding of multi-source and multi-frequency satellite remote sensing capabilities in wildfire detection and monitoring.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/rs16030556,"",,

A convergent approach, based on cognitive (conceptual) analysis methods, is employed in the research and applied to the formation of adaptive landscape farming systems. The fundamental principles of organizing DFMS include crop and environmental monitoring ( in situ , remote sensing); the formation of farming system archetypes based on the analysis of long-term field experiments; spatial object modeling and land typology using GIS; planning and support for agrotechnologies to adapt to natural and economic conditions; modeling ecosystem services and biodiversity; assessing the impact on the sustainability and economics of crop production. The system is implemented using geoinformation models in a specific geographic coordinate. DFMS involves conducting a ""inventory"" of natural and production resources, as well as identifying limits of climatic, soil, and agrolandscape parameters at different levels of land use intensity. At each stage of organizing system blocks, methods of intelligent data analysis and machine learning are used, with the core of the system relying on the use of knowledge bases and logical rules of the subject area. A key element of the system is the scaling of the results of long-term field experiments and accumulated knowledge in different management areas based on the parameterization of the multi-level variability of farming systems and the formation of their archetypes. The practical implementation of the main provisions of DFMS allows approaching the solution of key issues related to reducing the level of uncertainty and associated risks in agriculture. This is achieved through scientifically justified organization of rational land use, increasing the resilience of crop production in different land use conditions, and providing information support to rural producers.","",https://doi.org/10.26898/0370-8799-2024-3-1,"",,

Various Earth observation systems have been developed for crop monitoring and yield prediction. However, there is a need for further research that integrates multiplatform data, advances in satellite technology, and data processing to apply this knowledge to agricultural practices. The integration of satellite imagery and environmental data has been used increasingly in recent years to predict crop yields using machine learning techniques. In recent years, VIs derived from optical satellites, particularly Sentinel 2 (S2), have gained popularity, but their availability is affected by weather conditions. On the other hand, the backscatter data from Sentinel 1 (S1) is less commonly used in agriculture due to its complex interpretation and processing, but it is not influenced by the weather. This study aims to improve the accuracy of yield predictions by combining remote sensing data with environmental variables. The use of satellite data S1 and S2 was used to identify the optimal phenological period, and a training model was developed using four machine learning techniques, including Random Forest Regression (RF), K Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) and Decision Tree (DT). The results showed that RF provided the highest values among the four techniques. The validation process using RF demonstrated high accuracy rates, with R2 ranging from 0.41 to 0.89, the mean square error of the root (RMSE) ranging from 0.122 to 0.224 t/ha, and the mean absolute error (MAE) ranging from 0.089 to 0.163 t/ha. The integration of satellite data S1 and S2 with topographical information may be useful for monitoring, mapping, and forecasting crop yields on small and fragmented farmlands.

By applying integrated models of ANN-CA Markov, GeoDetector, and InVEST model, this study aimed to analyze LULC change, their driving factors, and implications on carbon storage in the Forest Management Unit (FMU) of Ampang Plampang in West Nusa Tenggara, Indonesia. Several data sources were utilized in the modelling approach, including DEM (Digital Elevation Model), topographical map, Landsat imageries (2011, 2016, 2021), measured carbon density (above ground, below ground, soil, dead organic), and socio-economic data (number of populations, farmer, and agricultural land). The dryland forest in the study area constitutes the most extensive LULC that has experienced significant declines due to deforestation, predominantly transforming into agricultural land, and these are predicted to continue until 2031 with different magnitudes. The significant driving factors of LULC change were elevation, population pressure on land, and distance from settlement. The LULC change also greatly influenced the decline of carbon storage historically (2011–2016) and in projected LULC (2026–2031). The conversion of forested areas to non-forest LULCs has released carbon emissions of about 1.89 Mt CO2-eq.

While efficient deep learning methods have been developed to process short time series of satellite imagery, leveraging long time series of aerial imagery remains a challenge, due to changes in imaging technologies, sensors, and acquisition conditions, as well as irregular time gaps between acquisitions. In this work, we tackle this challenge through the task of multi-temporal forest mapping at the treeline ecotone in the Swiss Alps. We work with time series of aerial imagery spanning the years 1946–2020, without forest segmentation labels except for the year 2020. We propose a multi-temporal deep learning method which takes irregular time gaps into consideration, and learns to overcome the large domain shift between acquisitions through a custom loss function encoding prior knowledge about forest cover dynamics. Using this method, we significantly improve the forest segmentation performance on historical images compared to a mono-temporal counterpart processing each acquisition independently, or multi-temporal counterparts trained with more generic temporal consistency loss functions. We show that our method is a promising approach for monitoring subtle temporal trends from heterogeneous remote sensing time series. Overall, our work suggests that by designing a deep learning architecture and a training procedure based on problem-specific prior knowledge, a variety of Earth processes can be monitored from long time series of remote sensing data with incomplete training labels.","",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2024.114109,"",,

In China, the area of cropland in oases has expanded significantly in recent decades, which results in a rapid increase in agricultural water demand and encroachment on grassland subsistence space. However, our knowledge about how the expansion of cropland affects oasis grasslands remains limited. We used machine learning, temporal segmentation of spectral trajectories, and maximum covariance analysis to generate an annual oasis grassland aboveground biomass (AGB) data set at 30‐m resolution from 1989 to 2021 based on multiple remotely sensed and ground observation data sets, and investigated the dynamics of grassland AGB under cropland expansion in oases. We found that overall oasis grassland AGB increased significantly (0.3 gm −2 yr −1 , P &lt; 0.01) during 1989–2021, but trends in AGB were not consistent across basins. In the Yellow River, Turpan Hami, Qaidam, and southern Altai Mountains River Basins, AGB was dominated by a significant increase. Conversely, in all basins in southern Xinjiang, AGB showed a decreasing trend due to the rapid cropland expansion. Spatially, cropland expansion and AGB dynamics were strongly coupled. In regions characterized by agricultural concentration, grassland AGB benefitted from resource spillover via edge effects. However, in downstream areas or those with a low proportion of cropland, where most grasslands are distributed, the relationship between the two shifted to a trade‐off.

This recognition stems from its profound adverse impacts on natural ecosystem functioning, biodiversity, soil productivity, and food availability. Consequently, understanding the spatial distribution of land degradation across all scales becomes imperative. This study employed land cover change and soil organic carbon (SOC) stock assessments to analyse land degradation within the eThekwini Municipality beyond the baseline period (2000–2015). Utilizing remote sensing and machine learning techniques, this research examined land degradation within the eThekwini Municipality over the period spanning 2000 to 2022. Landsat 7 (Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus – ETM+), Landsat 8 (Operational Land Imager 1 - OLI1), and Landsat 9 (Operational Land Imager 2 - OLI2) images were employed to extract variables for both land cover change and SOC stock prediction through XGBoost, LightGBM, Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) models. Among these models, LightGBM demonstrates superior performance, achieving an overall accuracy of 80.646 in land cover predictions and 77.869 in SOC stock predictions. Analysis of land cover change within the eThekwini Municipality unveiled a shift from forests and shrubland landscapes to cropland and built-up areas. This shift results in the municipality encountering losses in SOC stock between 2015 and 2022. The model predicted that most SOC stock losses occur at the 20–50 cm depth (9.27%), in comparison to the 7.21% loss at the 0–20 cm depth.

Irish oceanic raised bogs are a rare peatland ecosystem offering numerous ecosystem services, including C storage, biodiversity support and water regulation. However, they have been degraded over the centuries due to artificial drainage, followed by peat extraction, afforestation and agriculture. This has an overall negative impact on the functioning of peatlands, shifting them from a moderate C sink to a large C source. Recognizing the importance of these ecosystems, efforts are underway for conservation (rewetting and rehabilitation), while accurately accounting for C stock and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. However, the implementation of these efforts requires accurate identification and mapping of artificial drainage ditches. This study utilized very high‐resolution (25 cm) aerial imagery, and a deep learning (U‐Net) approach to map the visible artificial drainage (unobstructed by vegetation or infill) in raised bogs at a national scale. The results show that artificial drainage is widespread, with ~20 000 km of drains mapped. The overall accuracy of the model was 80% on an independent testing dataset. The data were also used to derive the Frac ditch which was 0.03 (fraction of artificial drainage on industrial peat extraction sites). This is lower than IPCC Tier 1 Frac ditch and can aid in IPCC Tier 2 reporting for Ireland. This is the first study to map drains with diverse sizes and patterns on Irish‐raised bogs using optical aerial imagery and deep learning methods. The map will serve as an important baseline dataset for evaluating the artificial drainage ditch conditions. It will prove useful for sustainable management, conservation and refined estimations of GHG emissions. The model's capacity for generalization implies its potential in mapping artificial drains in peatlands at a regional and global scale, thereby enhancing the comprehension of the global effects of artificial drainage ditches on peatlands.","",https://doi.org/10.1002/rse2.387,"",,
rayyan-220231350,Higher crop rotational diversity in more simplified agricultural landscapes in Northeastern Germany,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract Context Both crop rotational diversity and landscape diversity are important for ensuring resilient agricultural production and supporting biodiversity and ecosystem services in agricultural landscapes. However, the relationship between crop rotational diversity and landscape diversity is largely understudied. Objectives We aim to assess how crop rotational diversity is spatially organised in relation to soil, climate, and landscape diversity at a regional scale in Brandenburg, Germany. Methods We used crop rotational richness, Shannon’s diversity and evenness indices per field per decade (i.e., crop rotational diversity) as a proxy for agricultural diversity and land use and land cover types and habitat types as proxies for landscape diversity. Soil and climate characteristics and geographical positions were used to identify potential drivers of the diversity facets. All spatial information was aggregated at 10 × 10 km resolution, and statistical associations were explored with interpretable machine learning methods. Results Crop rotational diversity was associated negatively with landscape diversity metrics and positively with soil quality and the proportion of agricultural land use area, even after accounting for the other variables. Conclusion Our study indicates a spatial trade-off between crop and landscape diversity (competition for space), and crop rotations are more diverse in more simplified landscapes that are used for agriculture with good quality of soil conditions. The respective strategies and targets should be tailored to the corresponding local and regional conditions for maintaining or enhancing both crop and landscape diversity jointly to gain their synergistic positive impacts on agricultural production and ecosystem management.","",https://doi.org/10.1007/s10980-024-01889-x,"",,
rayyan-220231392,Evaluating Flood Damage to Paddy Rice Fields Using PlanetScope and Sentinel-1 Data in North-Western Nigeria: Towards Potential Climate Adaptation Strategies,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Floods are significant global disasters, but their impact in developing countries is greater due to the lower shock tolerance, many subsistence farmers, land fragmentation, poor adaptation strategies, and low technical capacity, which worsen food security and livelihoods. Therefore, accurate and timely monitoring of flooded crop areas is crucial for both disaster impact assessments and adaptation strategies. However, most existing methods for monitoring flooded crops using remote sensing focus solely on estimating the flood damage, neglecting the need for adaptation decisions. To address these issues, we have developed an approach to mapping flooded rice fields using Earth observation and machine learning. This approach integrates high-resolution multispectral satellite images with Sentinel-1 data. We have demonstrated the reliability and applicability of this approach by using a manually labelled dataset related to a devastating flood event in north-western Nigeria. Additionally, we have developed a land suitability model to evaluate potential areas for paddy rice cultivation. Our crop extent and land use/land cover classifications achieved an overall accuracy of between 93% and 95%, while our flood mapping achieved an overall accuracy of 99%. Our findings indicate that the flood event caused damage to almost 60% of the paddy rice fields. Based on the land suitability assessment, our results indicate that more land is suitable for cultivation during natural floods than is currently being used. We propose several recommendations as adaptation measures for stakeholders to improve livelihoods and mitigate flood disasters. This study highlights the importance of integrating multispectral and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data for flood crop mapping using machine learning. Decision-makers will benefit from the flood crop mapping framework developed in this study in a number of spatial planning applications.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/rs16193657,"",,
rayyan-220231394,USDA LTAR Common Experiment measurement: Aboveground biomass v1,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"The most important ecosystem service from agriculture is the provision of food, fiber, feed, and fuel. These outputs from the system are almost always a function of the amount of biomass accumulated above the soil surface (except with root crops). Measuring the aboveground biomass is necessary for determining the amount of plant material allocated to vegetative and reproductive organs. The amount of biomass allocated to these organs will vary to some degree each year due to interactions among the genetics, environment, and stressors. Measuring the vegetative-to-reproductive biomass ratio across treatments, landscapes, and years is an important metric and this ratio is termed the “harvest index.” The harvest index provides insight into improving management and cost efficiency in response to positive and negative impacts incurred from local (e.g., soil quality, pest and disease pressure, and weather), technological (e.g., genomic enhancement, precision inputs, and remote sensing/AI), or systematic (e.g., market, policy, and climate) sources. The amount of biomass remaining in the field is additionally important for determining the amount of C, N, P, K, S, and other nutrients returned to the soil. These data, paired with nutrient export and off-site losses, enable the construction of nutrient balances critical in evaluating tradeoffs among ecosystem services provided by agricultural landscapes. This protocol describes the methods used to collect aboveground biomass which includes everything that: Stays in the field: such as stem, stalk, branches, leaves, grain enclosures (such as pod shells and husk leaves), and grain support structures (such as cob and ear shank), and Leaves the field: such as grain, hay, fiber, and plant material for bioenergy production.","",https://doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.bp2l62zmkgqe/v1,"",,

Despite advances in remote sensing data for urban monitoring, coarse-grained classification systems and the lack of continuous temporal observations hinder the application of deep learning to urban change analysis. To address this, we introduce FUSU, a multi-source, multi-temporal change segmentation dataset for fine-grained urban semantic understanding. FUSU features the most detailed land use classification system to date, with 17 classes and 30 billion pixels of annotations. It includes bi-temporal high-resolution satellite images with 20-50 cm ground sample distance and monthly optical and radar satellite time series, covering 847 km2 across five urban areas in China. The fine-grained pixel-wise annotations and high spatial-temporal resolution data provide a robust foundation for deep learning models to understand urbanization and land use changes. To fully leverage FUSU, we propose a unified time-series architecture for both change detection and segmentation and benchmark FUSU on various methods for several tasks.

rayyan-220231440,A new era of genetic diversity conservation through novel tools and accessible data,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Due to increasing alarm over lost diversity, the past few years have seen quantum leaps in making genetics more accessible and relevant for use in practice and policy. A historic advance for conservation was made at the 2022 United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity COP15, when genetic diversity was protected for all species—not just socioeconomically and culturally valuable ones—in the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF). Here, we highlight new, affordable, and inclusive tools for measuring genetic diversity and emphasize the importance of their use to benefit nature and society. Improved application of genetic diversity data to conservation and management first requires documenting change across space and time. Meta-analyses have shown substantial genetic losses—incurred during the past century—in many species, especially those endemic to islands or that are heavily harvested (eg commercial fisheries). Genomic patterns across thousands of DNA nucleotides (eg runs of homozygosity) can now provide deeper insight into demographic histories, inbreeding, and the effects of natural selection. New models such as the mutations–area relationship can quantify the effects of habitat loss on genetic diversity at the population level, thereby helping to approximate the impacts of both threats and management (including restoration) activities. Meanwhile, Genetic Composition Essential Biodiversity Variables were developed to standardize the reporting of genetic diversity and to facilitate comparisons across studies (Biol Rev 2022; doi.org/10.1111/brv.12852). FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) have also been embraced to enable better comparisons across species and regions and to allow for more transparent and rigorous conclusions. Major efforts have focused on compiling, aggregating, and creating detailed metadata for thousands of previously produced genetic datasets. Through such efforts, an entirely new discipline—macrogenetics, which involves analyzing thousands of datasets to identify ecological drivers of genetic change in space and time—has arisen. Macrogenetics can empower systematic conservation planning, while also enabling the comparison of global genetic diversity maps to species-richness maps (Nat Rev Genet 2021; doi.org/10.1038/s41576-021-00394-0). Even as genetic data become more available, >99% of described species have yet to be studied genetically. Consequently, scalable and affordable non-DNA–based indicators were built on core evolutionary principles (eg maintaining sufficiently large distinct populations to prevent genetic erosion) and adopted by the GBF. These indicators enable rapid estimation of genetic diversity for more inclusive assessment and conservation action at large scales, including within developing and megadiverse countries (Conserv Lett 2023; doi.org/10.1111/conl.12953). Inclusivity is an important emphasis for the field of conservation genetics, with CARE principles (Collective benefit, Authority to control, Responsibility, and Ethics) adopted/adhered to during the collection, analysis, storage, and interpretation of genetic data, and linkage to other biodiversity information (eg occurrence data in the Global Biodiversity Information Facility). For decades, analyses of DNA sequences have helped guide ecological restoration, assess population resilience, and track processes like inbreeding or hybridization to address applied management questions. Formalized genetic monitoring programs at regional or national levels can be used to repeatedly and systematically assess populations through time to detect deleterious changes in genetic diversity that may require urgent protections. Genetic monitoring across species and ecosystems has identified areas undergoing rapid habitat loss or climate change—for example, by highlighting the importance of niche margins to protect unique genetic diversity (Nat Ecol Evol 2024; doi.org/10.1038/s41559-023-02260-0). Moving forward, genetic diversity assessments are likely to include more remote data collection, like environmental DNA (eDNA), to infer species' presence through the analysis of DNA shed into the environment (for example, in water, soil, or air). The field of eDNA is experiencing rapid technological advances that include abundance estimations and the sequencing of genetic diversity within populations. Simultaneously, high-resolution satellite imagery and deep learning can be used to estimate genetic diversity and population differentiation, without the need to physically sample DNA. We have entered a new era of transparent and inclusive analysis of the world's genetic diversity with advancements in macrogenetics, proxy-based tools, FAIR and CARE standards, and novel technologies. Uptake of new approaches can be amplified by collaborating through regional and global initiatives, such as the Coalition for Conservation Genetics (Conserv Sci Pract 2022; doi.org/10.1111/csp2.12635). Additional resources, along with new legal frameworks, tools, and policies, can help to advance the contributions of genetics in applied ecology and biodiversity conservation.","",https://doi.org/10.1002/fee.2740,"",,
rayyan-220231450,Quantifying the impact of Great Green Wall and Corporate plantations on tree density and biomass in Sahelian Senegal,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"The Great Green Wall (GGW) is an international initiative to combat land degradation and restore native plant life in the Sahel, but due to a lack of monitoring tools, it remains unknown to be considered as success or failure. Here, we quantify the impact of GGW plantations and Corporate plantations (privately owned) in Sahelian Senegal based on remote sensing data and deep learning by mapping individual trees and their biomass across the Sahel region. Tree features (cover, density and above-ground biomass) have been computed in every hectare of 42 plantations (of both, corporate and GGW) and their surrounding non-planted areas, subsequently used for a comparative analysis of tree features. Results showed that gains in tree features varied substantially between plantations. At plot scale, among Corporate plantations, the average gain in tree density was 61.16±42.12 trees/ha while it was 5.7±5.8 trees/ha for GGW plantations. In regards to tree cover, the average gain was 618.5±588.5 m2/ha for Corporate plantations and 71.72±108.89m2/ha for GGW plantations. For the above-ground biomass, the average gain was 3.36±3.29 tons/ha in the Corporate plantations and 0.46±0.67 tons/ha in the GGW plantations. The average gain in foliar biomass in the Corporate plantations was 0.15±0.13 tons/ha and in the GGW plantations, it was 0.02±0.03 tons/ha. The average gain in wood biomass was 3.21±3.12 tons/ha among the Corporate plantations and was 0.43±0.64 tons/ha among the GGW plantations. Notably, regarding the relative benefit in terms of ecosystem services per unit of density, each tree in GGW plantations contribute more to ecosystem services per unit of density compared to Corporate plantations. In GGW, each gained tree contributes 18 m2 of cover, 116.1 kg of above-ground biomass, 5.6 kg of foliar biomass, and 114.2 kg of woody biomass, while in corporate plantations, on the other hand, each gained tree adds 9 m2 of cover, 48.4 kg of above-ground biomass, 2.3 kg of foliar biomass, and 46.3 kg of woody biomass. These findings are opposed to conventional paradigms, suggesting that the Great Green Wall, while perhaps missing its tree density targets, has succeeded in its mission to produce ecosystem services per tree. This raises important questions about the redefinition of objectives in reforestation projects, focusing on quality rather than quantity, a perspective that could transform our understanding of the successes and failures of these essential ecological restoration initiatives. However, the assessment primarily relies on indicators such as cover and biomass, potentially overlooking other crucial ecosystem services. Therefore, while our conclusions underscore the effectiveness of reforestation initiatives, future research should aim to establish a more comprehensive understanding of ecosystem services by incorporating additional indicators beyond cover and biomass, such as species diversity, soil health, water retention, and habitat quality.","",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tfp.2024.100569,"",,

Monitoring changes in LULC using geospatial techniques can help to identify areas at risk for indefensible land use, low-grade environment, and especially for sustainable urban planning. This study aims to analyze the changing pattern, dynamics, and alteration of LULC using Google Earth Engine (GEE) and Machine Learning Applications for the years 1991, 2001, 2011, and 2022 in the Varanasi City Development Region (VCDR). The LULC classification was divided into seven classes using random forest classification, and Landsat-5(TM) and 9(OLI-2) satellite data were used. Saga GIS has been utilized for the detection of LULC change during the 1991-2022 period. For validation of classification results, accuracy assessment was estimated using error matrices and through user, producer, and overall accuracy estimation. The Kappa statistics were applied for the reliability of the accuracy assessment result. As a result, the built-up area increased by 507.8 percent, and other classes like agricultural, barren, fallow land, and vegetation cover rapidly declined and altered into concrete areas over the period. Water bodies and river sand classes have been slightly converted into different classes. The finding explains that 114.8 km2 of fertile agricultural land, 14.81 km2 barren land, and 12.93 km2 of vegetation cover transformed into impervious surface, which is unsustainable and causes various problems like food scarcity, environmental degradation, and low quality of urban life. This study can be a useful guide for urban planners, academicians, and policymakers by providing a scientific background for sustainable urban planning and management of VCDR and other cities as well.","",https://doi.org/10.46488/nept.2024.v23i01.031,"",,
rayyan-220231479,Soil physicochemical properties explain land use/cover histories in the last sixty years in China,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Enhancing our comprehension of soil processes and their impact on Earth requires precise quantification of human-induced soil alterations, particularly those related to land use/cover (LUC) histories. Thoroughly validated LUC and soil maps specific to China, and an explainable machine-learning approach were applied to reveal how soil physicochemical properties, independently or in combination, explain LUC histories in the last sixty years. Validation using historical data showed that the proposed machine-learning models can adequately simulate the pattern of LUC histories. Nonlinear mappings of various soil properties in explaining LUC histories were demonstrated and critical thresholds for changes in the explanatory capacities of each soil property to specific LUC histories were identified. Specifically, physical soil properties, except for soil pH, particularly soil thickness, clay content, bulk density, and coarse fragments, play significant roles in explaining the historical trajectories of forests, croplands, and pasture/rangelands than chemical soil properties. Predicted LUC changes suggest more intensive dynamics that are characterized by expansions in forest and pasture/rangeland areas, coupled with a reduction in cropland areas. Overall, improving understanding of the bidirectional links between soil and LUC changes is a crucial and imperative step towards refining the representation of soils in Earth system models.","",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2024.116908,"",,
rayyan-220231493,Tree Species Classification from UAV Canopy Images with Deep Learning Models,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Forests play a critical role in the provision of ecosystem services, and understanding their compositions, especially tree species, is essential for effective ecosystem management and conservation. However, identifying tree species is challenging and time-consuming. Recently, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with various sensors have emerged as a promising technology for species identification due to their relatively low cost and high spatial and temporal resolutions. Moreover, the advancement of various deep learning models makes remote sensing based species identification more a reality. However, three questions remain to be answered: first, which of the state-of-the-art models performs best for this task; second, which is the optimal season for tree species classification in a temperate forest; and third, whether a model trained in one season can be effectively transferred to another season. To address these questions, we focus on tree species classification by using five state-of-the-art deep learning models on UAV-based RGB images, and we explored the model transferability between seasons. Utilizing UAV images taken in the summer and fall, we captured 8799 crown images of eight species. We trained five models using summer and fall images and compared their performance on the same dataset. All models achieved high performances in species classification, with the best performance on summer images, with an average F1-score was 0.96. For the fall images, Vision Transformer (ViT), EfficientNetB0, and YOLOv5 achieved F1-scores greater than 0.9, outperforming both ResNet18 and DenseNet. On average, across the two seasons, ViT achieved the best accuracy. This study demonstrates the capability of deep learning models in forest inventory, particularly for tree species classification. While the choice of certain models may not significantly affect performance when using summer images, the advanced models prove to be a better choice for fall images. Given the limited transferability from one season to another, further research is required to overcome the challenge associated with transferability across seasons.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/rs16203836,"",,

Erosion is the physical–mechanical loss of the soil that affects its functions and ecosystem services while producing a reduction in its productive capacity. Progradation is the deposition of layers in the basinward direction while moving coastward. Other studies have investigated these two phenomena using optical images, encountering difficulties due to the persistent presence of clouds in this region. In order to avoid the cloud effects, in this study, we used 16 Sentinel 1 SAR images with two different polarizations between 2016 and 2023. First, each image was rescaled from 0 to 255, then the image was despeckled by a deep learning (DL) model. Afterwards, a single RGB image was composed with the filtered polarizations. Next, a classifier with 99% accuracy based on Otsu’s method was used to determine whether each pixel was water or not. Then, the classified image was registered to a reference one using Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF (ORB) descriptor. Finally, a multitemporal analysis was performed by comparing every image to the previous one to identify the studied phenomena, calculating areas. Also, all images were integrated to obtain a heatmap that showed the overall changes across eight years (2016–2023) in a single image. The multitemporal analysis performed found that the newly created mouth is the most active area for these processes, coinciding with other studies. In addition, a comparison of these findings with the Oceanic Niño Index (ONI) showed a relative delayed coupling to the erosion process and a coupling of progradation with dry and wet seasons.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/rs16030552,"",,

Unraveling the interconnectedness between land use/cover (LULC) transformation and the ecosystem service value (ESV) in these regions is of profound importance for sustainable development. In this paper, the LULC response in the Tumen River Basin (TRB) to an assessment of ESV from 2000 to 2020 was explored. An advanced equivalent factor that incorporates both biomass and socioeconomic factors was used to evaluate the ESV of the TRB. Taking the potential impact of factors such as temperature (TEM), precipitation (PRE), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), digital elevation model (DEM), soil organic matter content (SOMC), and human activity intensity of land surface (HAILS) into account, the patch-generating land use simulation model (PLUS) was used to simulate and predict the spatial evolution of the ESV under different land resource management strategies in 2030. The results indicate an increasing trend in the total ESV in the study area from 2000 to 2020, with forested land accounting for nearly 94% of the total ESV for the TRB. HAILS, DEM, and NDVI were identified as the main factors affecting the spatial differentiation of ESV. A negative correlation (−0.65) was found between ESV and the landscape shape ndex (LSI), indicating that more irregularly shaped landscapes have a lower ESV. Positive correlations were observed between the Shannon’s Diversity Index (SHDI) (0.72) and the Aggregation Index (AI) (0.60), suggesting that more diverse and interconnected landscapes have a higher ESV. The PLUS simulation results provide valuable data-based support for achieving planning objectives under different land resource management strategies.

The study focuses on three drivers: land use change, irrigation expansion, and climate change (CC), and their impact on the current and future water availability across the sub-basin. The study uses a random forest (RF) machine learning classifier in the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform to detect land use land cover change (LULC) and for mapping the actual irrigated-area. The Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation and temperature data were used with station data to evaluate the implication of CC on the water availability of Lake Tana sub-basin. The supply-demand relationship was done for Gumara catchment within Tana sub-basin as an experimental site. Based on the LULC analysis, plantation, cropland, bare lands, built-up, and wetland showed an increasing trend, while forest, bush land, and grassland showed a decreasing trend. The increasing rate of crop land in the expense of natural forest, shrub land, grassland may cause runoff/flood, high soil erosion, and lower rate of groundwater recharge. The actual irrigated area mapping analysis shows a widespread irrigation near the Lake Shore and upstream parts of the sub-basin. The climate change analysis shows an increasing trend of potential evapotranspiration during the irrigation period attributed to increase in maximum temperature. The rising of potential evapotranspiration during the irrigation period creates a water shortage in the study and future periods as the crops need more water for growth. The estimated stream flow for Gumara catchment shows an increasing trend for the future period. The supply-demand relationship of the catchment shows an uneven distribution of water in the Gumara catchment both in the current and future periods resulting in unbalance abstraction of irrigation water. The study reveals that climate change, land cover change, and uncontrolled expansion of irrigated land area are likely to increase the unmet demand by increasing irrigation water demand, and this can cause conflict of interest between the users. Therefore, sustainable water resource management practices such as land management practices, and adaptive management of irrigation should be applicable to prevent or reduce the occurrence of conflict over the water demand.","",https://doi.org/10.59122/15519a9,"",,
rayyan-220231628,Channel Attention GAN-Based Synthetic Weed Generation for Precise Weed Identification,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Weed is a major biological factor causing declines in crop yield. However, widespread herbicide application and indiscriminate weeding with soil disturbance are of great concern because of their environmental impacts. Site-specific weed management (SSWM) refers to a weed management strategy for digital agriculture that results in low energy loss. Deep learning is crucial for developing SSWM, as it distinguishes crops from weeds and identifies weed species. However, this technique requires substantial annotated data, which necessitates expertise in weed science and agronomy. In this study, we present a channel attention mechanism-driven generative adversarial network (CA-GAN) that can generate realistic synthetic weed data. The performance of the model was evaluated using two datasets: the public segmented Plant Seedling Dataset (sPSD), featuring nine common broadleaf weeds from arable land, and the Institute for Sustainable Agro-ecosystem Services (ISAS) dataset, which includes five common summer weeds in Japan. Consequently, the synthetic dataset generated by the proposed CA-GAN obtained an 82.63% recognition accuracy on the sPSD and 93.46% on the ISAS dataset. The Fréchet inception distance (FID) score test measures the similarity between a synthetic and real dataset, and it has been shown to correlate well with human judgments of the quality of synthetic samples. The synthetic dataset achieved a low FID score (20.95 on the sPSD and 24.31 on the ISAS dataset).

Therefore, research on ecosystem health is imperative for ecosystem management and restoration in arid pastoral areas. Although ecosystem health studies have been conducted in various regions, research on ecological health assessment in arid pastoral areas of Central Asia remains limited, especially within a mountain-basin system (MBS). Taking the Chinese pastoral region of Fuyun County in Altay Prefecture, Xinjiang, as our study area, we improved an evaluation framework in terms of Vigor-Organization-Resilience-Service (VORS) based on remote sensing and GIS technology, and innovatively employed a deep learning method to assess the ecological system health status and spatiotemporal patterns for the years 2000, 2010, and 2020. Our results indicate the following: (1) The evaluation method based on deep learning can achieve a more comprehensive, efficient and objective evaluation of ecosystem health. (2) The ecosystem health index (EHI) ranged from 0.0759 to 0.5735 in 2000, 0.0798 to 0.5952 in 2010, and 0.0415 to 0.5657 in 2020. (3) The distribution pattern of EHI exhibited spatial heterogeneity, with the indexes decreasing from north to south. The highest proportion of high ecosystem health level (EHL) was found in summer pastures, followed by those in north of spring/autumn pastures and along the Irtysh and Ulungur rivers. On the other hand, the EHLs were relatively low in spring/autumn and winter pasture areas. The EHL exhibited minimal alteration between 2000 and 2010. From 2010 to 2020, areas experiencing an increase in EHL were primarily concentrated along the Ulungur River, with another part of the region focused on the interface between winter pastures and spring/autumn pastures. Based on the results, rotational grazing and grazing prohibition should be put into place for the winter pastures in the central and southern regions of the study area, as well as for the spring and autumn pastures. Meanwhile, it is recommended to plant premium, high-yield artificial forage grass alongside the Irtysh and Ulungur rivers.

Amidst an increasing rate of global forest loss due to various natural and anthropogenic factors, many countries are committed to battling forest loss by planting new forests. Despite the reported national statistics on the land area in plantations, accurately delineating boundaries of planted forests with remotely sensed data remains a great challenge. In this study, we explored several deep learning approaches based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for mapping the extent of planted forests in the Korean Peninsula. Our methodology involved data preprocessing, the application of data augmentation techniques, and rigorous model training, with performance assessed using various evaluation metrics. To ensure robust performance and accuracy, we validated the model’s predictions across the Korean Peninsula. Our analysis showed that the integration of the Near Infrared band from 10 m Sentinel-2 remote sensing images with the UNet deep learning model, incorporated with unfrozen ResNet-34 backbone architecture, produced the best model performance. With a recall of 64% and precision of 76.8%, the UNet model surpassed the other pixel-based deep learning models, including DeepLab and Pyramid Sense Parsing, in terms of classification accuracy. When compared to the ensemble-based Random Forest (RF) machine learning model, the RF approach demonstrates a significantly lower recall rate of 55.2% and greater precision of 92%.

rayyan-220231693,Beyond clouds: Seamless flood mapping using Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2 time series imagery and water occurrence data,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Floods are among the most devastating natural disasters, posing significant risks to life, property, and infrastructure globally. Earth observation satellites provide data for continuous and extensive flood monitoring, yet limitations exist in the spatial completeness of monitoring using optical images due to cloud cover. Recent studies have developed gap-filling methods for reconstructing cloud-covered areas in water maps. However, these methods are not tailored for and validated in cloudy and rainy flooding scenarios with rapid water extent changes and limited clear-sky observations, leaving room for further improvements. This study investigated and developed a novel reconstruction method for time series flood extent mapping, supporting spatially seamless monitoring of flood extents. The proposed method first identified surface water from time series images using a fine-tuned large foundation model. Then, the cloud-covered areas in the water maps were reconstructed, adhering to the introduced submaximal stability assumption, on the basis of the prior water occurrence data in the Global Surface Water dataset. The reconstructed time series water maps were refined through spatiotemporal Markov random field modeling for the final delineation of flooding areas. The effectiveness of the proposed method was evaluated with Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2 datasets under varying cloud cover conditions, enabling seamless flood mapping at 2–3-day frequency and 30 m resolution. Experiments at four global sites confirmed the superiority of the proposed method. It achieved higher reconstruction accuracy with average F1-scores of 0.931 during floods and 0.903 before/after floods, outperforming the typical gap-filling method with average F1-scores of 0.871 and 0.772, respectively. Additionally, the maximum flood extent maps and flood duration maps, which were composed on the basis of the reconstructed water maps, were more accurate than those using the original cloud-contaminated water maps. The benefits of synthetic aperture radar images (e.g., Sentinel-1) for enhancing flood mapping under cloud cover conditions were also discussed. The method proposed in this paper provided an effective way for flood monitoring in cloudy and rainy scenarios, supporting emergency response and disaster management. The code and datasets used in this study have been made available online (https://github.com/dr-lizhiwei/SeamlessFloodMapper).","",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2024.07.022,"",,

rayyan-220231721,Measuring Tailings Storage Facility Bathymetry Using Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8/9 Multispectral Imagery and Machine Learning,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract. Tailings, a byproduct of mining, consist of fine sediment particles suspended in water that are stored in tailings storage facilities (TSFs). The discharge of untreated TSF water into the environment is typically prohibited due to its contact with mine tailings and processing chemicals. TSF failures have caused damage to communities and the environment, prompting calls for better management practices and advanced monitoring tools. For operational mine water management, boat-based bathymetric surveys have been used. However, these technologies have limitations, especially when the surveying of large facilities is required. Advances in remote sensing, particularly satellite-based earth observation (SBEO), offer cost-effective solutions for monitoring TSFs. This study explores the use of machine learning models, including XGBoost and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), applied to Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8/9 data to estimate TSF bathymetry. Surveyed bathymetry datasets were used for model training, testing, and results validation. The results of the experiments revealed that high-accuracy bathymetric estimates could be obtained with mean absolute errors between 6 and 12 cm depending on the source of the data (i.e. Sentinel-2 or Landsat-8/9) and the model used (XGBoost vs CNN). Limitations include mixed pixel effects on the pond-beach interface and lower accuracies obtained in shallow areas, notably when XGBoost is used. This research underscores the potential of using satellite data and machine learning for TSF bathymetric monitoring, with implications for enhancing environmental and safety standards in mining operations.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/isprs-archives-xlviii-m-4-2024-63-2024,"",,

In this study, we developed a modeling approach to predict the Aboveground biomass (AGB) in Cerrado vegetation using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), vegetation indices retrieved from RapidEye satellite imagery, and field data acquired within the Federal District territory, Brazil. Correlation testing was performed to identify potential vegetation index candidates to be used as input in the AGB modeling. Several ANNs were trained to predict the AGB in the study area using vegetation indices and field data. The optimum ANN was selected according to criteria of mean error of the estimate, correlation coefficient, and graphical analysis. The best performing ANN showed a predictive power of 90% and RMSE less than 17%. The validation tests showed no significant difference between the observed and ANN-predicted values. We estimated an average AGB of 16.55± 8.6 Mg.ha-1 in shrublands in the study area.

This disease is currently prevented through the regular application of detrimental crop protection products and is guided by early warnings based on weather predictions and visual observations by farmers. To reduce the use of crop protection products, without additional production losses, it would be beneficial to be able to automatically detect Alternaria solani in potato fields. In recent years, the potential of deep learning in precision agriculture is receiving increasing research attention. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are currently the state of the art, but also come with challenges, especially regarding in-field robustness. This stems from the fact that they are often trained on datasets that are limited in size or have been recorded in controlled environments, not necessarily representative of real-world settings. We collected a dataset consisting of ultra-high-resolution modified RGB UAV-imagery of both symptomatic and non-symptomatic potato crops in the field during various years and disease stages to cover the great variability in agricultural data. We developed a convolutional neural network to perform in-field detection of Alternaria , defined as a binary classification problem. Our model achieves a similar accuracy as several state-of-the-art models for disease detection, but has a much lower inference time, which enhances its practical applicability. By using training data of three consecutive growing seasons (2019, 2020 and 2021) and test data of an independent fourth year (2022), an F1 score of 0.93 is achieved.

rayyan-220231753,Remote Sensing and Modeling of the Cryosphere in High Mountain Asia: A Multidisciplinary Review,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Over the past decades, the cryosphere has changed significantly in High Mountain Asia (HMA), leading to multiple natural hazards such as rock–ice avalanches, glacier collapse, debris flows, landslides, and glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs). Monitoring cryosphere change and evaluating its hydrological effects are essential for studying climate change, the hydrological cycle, water resource management, and natural disaster mitigation and prevention. However, knowledge gaps, data uncertainties, and other substantial challenges limit comprehensive research in climate–cryosphere–hydrology–hazard systems. To address this, we provide an up-to-date, comprehensive, multidisciplinary review of remote sensing techniques in cryosphere studies, demonstrating primary methodologies for delineating glaciers and measuring geodetic glacier mass balance change, glacier thickness, glacier motion or ice velocity, snow extent and water equivalent, frozen ground or frozen soil, lake ice, and glacier-related hazards. The principal results and data achievements are summarized, including URL links for available products and related data platforms. We then describe the main challenges for cryosphere monitoring using satellite-based datasets. Among these challenges, the most significant limitations in accurate data inversion from remotely sensed data are attributed to the high uncertainties and inconsistent estimations due to rough terrain, the various techniques employed, data variability across the same regions (e.g., glacier mass balance change, snow depth retrieval, and the active layer thickness of frozen ground), and poor-quality optical images due to cloudy weather. The paucity of ground observations and validations with few long-term, continuous datasets also limits the utilization of satellite-based cryosphere studies and large-scale hydrological models. Lastly, we address potential breakthroughs in future studies, i.e., (1) outlining debris-covered glacier margins explicitly involving glacier areas in rough mountain shadows, (2) developing highly accurate snow depth retrieval methods by establishing a microwave emission model of snowpack in mountainous regions, (3) advancing techniques for subsurface complex freeze–thaw process observations from space, (4) filling knowledge gaps on scattering mechanisms varying with surface features (e.g., lake ice thickness and varying snow features on lake ice), and (5) improving and cross-verifying the data retrieval accuracy by combining different remote sensing techniques and physical models using machine learning methods and assimilation of multiple high-temporal-resolution datasets from multiple platforms. This comprehensive, multidisciplinary review highlights cryospheric studies incorporating spaceborne observations and hydrological models from diversified techniques/methodologies (e.g., multi-spectral optical data with thermal bands, SAR, InSAR, passive microwave, and altimetry), providing a valuable reference for what scientists have achieved in cryosphere change research and its hydrological effects on the Third Pole.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/rs16101709,"",,

However, significant uncertainties persist in global ET estimates. Focusing on the area between 60°, we performed an intercomparison of 90 state‐of‐the‐art ET products from 1980 to 2014. These products were obtained from various sources or methods and were grouped into six categories: remote sensing, reanalysis, land surface models, climate models, machine learning methods, and ensemble estimates. It is shown that global ET magnitudes of categories differ considerably, with averages ranging from 518.4 to 706.3 mm yr −1 . Spatial patterns are generally consistent but with significant divergence in tropical rainforests. Global trends are mildly positive or negative (−0.10 to 0.37 mm yr −2 ) depending on categories but with distinct spatial variability. Evaluation against site measurements reveals various performances across land cover types; the ideal point error values range from 0.45 to 0.83, with wetlands performing the worst and open shrublands the best. Using the three‐cornered hat method, there are spatial differences in ET uncertainty, with lower uncertainty for ensemble estimates, showing less than 15% relative uncertainty in most areas. The best global ET data set varies depending on the intended use and study region. Distinct spatial patterns of controlling factors across categories have been identified, with precipitation driving arid and semi‐arid regions and leaf area index dominating tropical regions. It is suggested to include advancing precipitation inputs, incorporate vegetation dynamics, and employ hybrid modeling in future ET estimates. Constraining estimates using complementary data and robust theoretical frameworks can enhance credibility in ET estimation.","",https://doi.org/10.1029/2024wr037608,"",,

Yet currently, there is not a tractable solution for mapping tropical forested wetlands at high spatial and temporal resolutions at a regional scale. This means that we lack accurate and up-to-date information about some of the world’s most significant wetlands, including the Amazon Basin. RadWet-L is an automated machine-learning classification technique for the mapping of both inundated forests and open water using ALOS ScanSAR data. We applied and validated RadWet-L for the Amazon Basin. The proposed method is computationally light and transferable across the range of landscape types in the Amazon Basin allowing, for the first time, regional inundation maps to be produced every 42 days at 50 m resolution over the period 2019–2023. Time series estimates of inundation extent from RadWet-L were significantly correlated with NASA-GFZ GRACE-FO water thickness (Pearson’s r = 0.96, p &lt; 0.01), USDA G-REALM lake hight (Pearson’s r between 0.63 and 0.91, p &lt; 0.01), and in situ river stage measurements (Pearson’s r between 0.78 and 0.94, p &lt; 0.01).

The general goal of this study is to analyse different sources of information to quantify land use and land cover change (LULCC) in the River Tea SCI (Galicia, NW Spain) in 2015-2023. The study area has multiple coverages with very low variability between them and with a great deal of fragmentation in the territory, which makes it difficult to obtain high accuracy levels. Land cover was classified using object-based image analysis (OBIA) Classification and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) methodologies based on images from the Sentinel-2 and Planet Labs (RapidEye and PlanetScope) multispectral satellite platforms. In addition, simulations for 2031 were carried out using different techniques based on post-classification. The highest accuracy obtained in this study is 80 %, for the Planet Labs data and the OBIA methodology. Using the same methodology and Sentinel-2 data the best accuracy obtained is around 70 %, with the Planet Labs data and the ANN developed the accuracy is around 55 %. Thus, the data used and the methodology followed influence the accuracy levels obtained in the classifications. The choice of what data and methodology are to be used depends on the goals pursued and on the characteristics of the study area.

Aerial and satellite imagery can provide vital information to relief organizations about the extent and distribution of damages after natural disasters. With manual change detection being too inefficient to be effective, the pursuit of automated change detection has accelerated with the recent developments of deep learning methods. Off-nadir imagery (captured not directly overhead) is the fastest to acquire post-disaster, making it ideal for disaster management scenarios. However, the changes in viewing angles result in shadows and occlusions, making damage detection more difficult. Differences in illumination conditions are ever present in bitemporal aerial and satellite imagery, especially for off-nadir imagery, where the reflectance angle affects the amount of light returning to the sensor, making it harder to detect changes and damages. The hypothesis of this study was that artificial intelligence methods fail to adequately account for the illumination differences between images. To test this hypothesis, two radiometric enhancements, matching and equalization, were applied to four change and damage detection datasets, including a damage detection dataset from the 2010 Haiti earthquake. Using a leading high accuracy fusion convolutional neural network architecture called Changer, improvements of up to 20 percent for F1-Score, a popular remote sensing metric for quantifying the number of correctly classified pixels for specific datasets, were achieved through applying radiometric enhancement techniques. Applying radiometric enhancements on a case-by-case basis led to considerable improvements in accuracy, showing the promise of radiometric enhancement. Lower accuracies were achieved on the Haiti dataset, outlining the need for large disaster-specific datasets for training.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/isprs-archives-xlviii-m-4-2024-33-2024,"",,

The black grouse (Lyrurus tetrix), a galliform species emblematic of the European Alps, is currently threatened by habitat change. The estimation of population dynamics, and in particular the reproductive success of this species, represents a significant challenge for the long-term conservation of the black grouse. In this study, we attempted to map black grouse brood habitat suitability (BHS) at the scale of an Alpine bioregion, coupling a species distribution model (SDM) with multi-source remote sensing data. To extract landscape composition features likely to influence BHS, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) were employed to characterise very high spatial resolution (VHSR) SPOT6-7 imagery. Altitude, phenological indices derived from Sentinel-2 time series (NDVImax, NDWI1max), and a texture feature derived from the SPOT6-7 images (Haralick entropy) were used to refine landscape characterisation. An SDM based on a random forest ensemble model was used to map black grouse BHS. Altitude, ericaceous heathland and NDVImax emerged as the three most significant variables, consistent with the ecological needs of black grouse. The proportion of ericaceous heathland was especially representative of the foraging needs of female black grouse; the main ecological determinant of habitat suitability for brood rearing with sufficient vegetation cover. This study highlights the effectiveness of integrating VHSR and multispectral time series, together with the advantages offered by deep learning techniques, in extracting species-specific information tailored to conservation issues. The BHS map, produced on a regional scale, constitutes a significant advances in the monitoring of the current population dynamics of black grouse at the western limit of the species' geographical distribution.","",https://doi.org/10.22541/au.173039591.10621475/v1,"",,

The aim of the study is to use UAV images and the computer vision technique of the YOLOv7 model to detect individuals of A. angustifolia. The FOM is essential for local biodiversity conservation and human well-being but faces challenges due to urban sprawl and the conversion of land use to agriculture. The species is critically endangered, requiring actions and strategies for its conservation. The study highlights the role of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and deep learning techniques, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), in identifying tree species in urban ecosystems. YOLOv7, an architecture based on CNNs, was chosen because of its detection capacity. YOLOv7 is especially effective at detecting a wide variety of objects, including people, vehicles, animals, household objects, road signs and much more, making it an ideal choice for identifying tree species in urban environments. The data was obtained by a DJI Mavic 3 UAV. Utilizing a UAV, the study area of the urban forest was flown over, generating an orthomosaic that was subsequently divided into 14 parts for training, validation, and testing. The YOLOv7 model was trained with the images to detect A. angustifolia trees present in the area. The results show that model achieved a precision of 79.3%, recall of 86.8%, and Mean Average Precision of 87% during training. Comparative analysis with forest inventory data reveals promising performance in detecting A. angustifolia trees.

This study developed a convolutional neural network – long short-term memory (ConvLSTM) deep learning model to produce daily surface (5 cm) and subsurface (25 cm) SM products by integrating SMAP Level 3 ancillary data, North American Land Data Assimilation System Phase 2 (NLDAS-2) SM, and Soil Landscapes of the United States (SOLUS100) digital maps across the contiguous U.S. Two input scenarios were evaluated: scenario 1 used only SMAP ancillary data, and scenario 2 included both SMAP ancillary data and SOLUS100 soil maps. Model evaluation with in-situ SM data showed higher accuracy for scenario 2, indicating the importance of soil properties (texture and bulk density) in SM estimation. Coarse-textured soils showed the highest estimation accuracy, followed by medium- and fine-textured soils. The model also performed in estimating subsurface SM than surface SM for most land-cover types. Incorporating SMAP ancillary data and SOLUS100 digital soil maps into ConvLSTM improved surface and subsurface SM estimation. The results highlight the potential of deep learning for integrating multi-source multi-scale observations for improving SM estimation at large scale.","",https://doi.org/10.20944/preprints202412.1356.v1,"",,

These changes often influence man and environment relationships. Escalating population pressure and demand for land resources induce substantial alterations which are predominantly driven by human activities. The 'Panchnoi' river basin exemplifies similar changes. This study evaluates the rate of land use fragmentation and land cover changes utilizing satellite imagery and GIS. Different key metrics, such as the number of patches (NP) and mean patch size (MPS), reveal insights into land fragmentation patterns. The impact is evident in the rising NP and declining MPS, indicating significant fragmentation in the Panchnoi River Basin between 2008 and 2019 across multiple land-use and land-cover categories. Anticipating future changes, a Land Use and Land Cover Prediction Map for 2026, generated using MOLUSCE Plugins (specifically, ANN-Multi Layer Perception) within QGIS Version 2.8.2, aims to predict shifts and discern the evolution in land use patterns from 2008 to 2019 and into 2026. The ANN-Multi Layer Perception is a quick way of projecting future transitions of land use and land cover of the Panchnoi River basin. As the forest and grassland areas are declining rapidly, such type of prediction will help policymakers for effective management of ecosystems of the river basin. The grassland area is projected to experience the most significant reduction, decrease from 6421.860 hectares in 2008 to just 0.0224 hectares by 2026 over a span of 18 years. The study not only focuses on land use fragmentation in the Panchnoi River basin but also predicts the changing trend of land use using the Artificial Neural Network (CA-ANN) technique.","",https://doi.org/10.19040/ecocycles.v10i2.444,"",,
rayyan-220231913,Assessing the impacts of land use and climate change on streamflow generation in the Nowrangpur catchment based on the SWAT-land-use update tool,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"ABSTRACT Climate change and land-use change are two major factors that affect the hydrologic response of a river basin. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) is a reliable method to model the hydrology of a river basin. The SWAT-land-use update tool offers a user-friendly interface for the incorporation of dynamic land-use changes into hydrological modeling. This paper evaluates the impacts of climate and dynamic land-use changes on the streamflow generation in the Nowrangpur catchment encompassing Indravati dam, which is a major water resources project in India. Calibrating the SWAT model involved updating land-use data from 1985 to 2015, yielding satisfactory results. The future land-use/land-cover changes were predicted using the cellular atomata-artificial neural network model. Downscaled general circulation model data from 10 climate models were utilized to predict climate change impacts up to 2100. Projections indicate increased precipitation during the months from August to December with a more pronounced increase in the mid and far future. An uptrend in maximum and minimum temperatures for all months is observed in the far future relative to the baseline period. Furthermore, the streamflow predictions indicate a near-future decrease in total annual streamflow, followed by an increase of up to 41% in the mid and far future.","",https://doi.org/10.2166/wcc.2024.265,"",,

Satellite imageries and published Ecosystem Service Value (ESV) coefficient with benefits transfer method has been used to estimate ESV in response to Land Use and Land Cover Change (LULC). We used Artificial-neural-network-based cellular automaton (ANN-CA) model to simulate LULC in 2030 and 2050 based on LULC data from 1990 to 2020. Predicted results reveal that agricultural land, barren land, vegetation, and water bodies are likely to decline by 7.56%, 3.06%, 12.22%, and 1.77%, respectively, between 2020 and 2050, but built-up areas are expected to increase by 24.61% owing to urbanization, industrialization, and economic growth. ESV results indicate that vegetation and agriculture make up 70% of the overall ESV, making them the leading LULC groups. The overall ESV could fall by 8.95 US$ ×106/year, mostly due to a decline in agricultural land, waterbodies, and vegetation. This study also identified the contribution of individual Ecosystem Services (ES) functions to the overall ESV. In 2020 and 2050, the ratio of provisioning, regulating, and supporting services to overall ESV is expected to decline from 19.95–8.77%, 39.60–25.60%, and 28.80–13.63%, respectively. On the contrary, the proportion of cultural services to total ESV will rise from 11.66% in 2020 to 52% in 2050, illustrating the rising importance of non-material ecological benefits like as recreation and tourism. The tool utilized in this study, which combines LULC with ES valuation, will aid policymakers and urban planners in current and future sustainable land management.","",https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-4634073/v1,"",,

This project proposes a Real-Time Flood Mapping and Compensation System using the Attention U-Net deep learning model. Satellite imagery is analysed to detect and segment flood-affected regions with high precision. The Attention U-Net architecture enhances segmentation accuracy by focusing on the most relevant regions in the images while ignoring irrelevant or noisy areas, such as clouds or non-flooded landscapes. The system integrates geospatial data on land boundaries to assess flood severity for individual properties, enabling fair and data-driven compensation for affected landowners. This project holds significant potential for transforming flood disaster management by reducing response times, fostering transparency, and empowering affected communities to recover more effectively.

The largest brackish water coastal lagoon in Asia, Chilika Lake, is a wetland of international importance included in the Ramsar site due to its rich biodiversity, productivity, and precious habitat for migrating birds and rare species. The vulnerable ecosystems of the Chilika Lagoon are subject to climate effects (monsoon effects) and anthropogenic activities (overexploitation through fishing and pollution by microplastics). Such environmental pressure results in the eutrophication of the lake, coastal erosion, fluctuations in size, and changes in land cover types in the surrounding landscapes. The habitat monitoring of the coastal lagoons is complex and difficult to implement with conventional Geographic Information System (GIS) methods. In particular, landscape variability, patch fragmentation, and landscape dynamics play a crucial role in environmental dynamics along the eastern coasts of the Bay of Bengal, which is strongly affected by the Indian monsoon system, which controls the precipitation pattern and ecosystem structure. To improve methods of environmental monitoring of coastal areas, this study employs the methods of ML and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), which present a powerful tool for computer vision, image classification, and analysis of Earth Observation (EO) data. Multispectral satellite data were processed by several ML image classification methods, including Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and the ANN-based MultiLayer Perceptron (MLP) Classifier. The results are compared and discussed. The ANN-based approach outperformed the other methods in terms of accuracy and precision of mapping. Ten land cover classes around the Chilika coastal lagoon were identified via spatio-temporal variations in land cover types from 2019 until 2024.

In this study, we analyze the spatiotemporal dynamics of avocado frontier expansion and intensification from 2011 to 2019 and assess their effects on landscape connectivity, focusing on Michoacán, Mexico, the world’s leading avocado exporter. Using high-resolution satellite imagery combined with deep learning based on convolutional neural networks, we delineated avocado orchards and other land use/cover classes, mapped individual avocado tree crowns and irrigation ponds, and identified hotspots of expanding and intensifying avocado production. We used a circuit theory approach to evaluate the effects of avocado expansion and intensification on the connectivity of natural and semi-natural habitats. Our results reveal a rapid increase in avocado orchards, which expanded by 4,175 ha—a growth from 27.9% to 37% in area—over the eight-year period. There was also a decline in rainfed agriculture by 3,252 ha, and oak-pine forests by 1,343 ha. We observed not only the expansion of the avocado frontier into forests but also an intensification of avocado production via increases in high-density plantations, irrigation ponds, and orchards prone to intensive pruning. Moreover, lower-intensity land-use classes, such as rainfed crops, were rapidly converted to avocado orchards. This expansion and intensification have led to increasing isolation of forest fragments. Although we identified routes that could facilitate the movement of species, the dense avocado monocultures continue to threaten the connectivity of natural and semi-natural habitats, causing notable losses of old-growth oak-pine forests and disrupting crucial ecological corridors. Our research underscores the adverse effects of avocado production on land use and landscape connectivity, emphasizing the need for sustainable management practices to ensure the long-term viability of avocado production systems and overall ecosystem functioning.","",https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/ad948c,"",,
rayyan-220232017,"Deep Learning‐Based Precipitation Simulation for Tropical Cyclones, Mesoscale Convective Systems, and Atmospheric Rivers in East Asia",,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract Different types of weather events, including tropical cyclones (TCs), mesoscale convective systems (MCSs), and atmospheric rivers (ARs), significantly impact precipitation patterns in East Asia. This study pioneers the application of deep learning (DL) methods, including convolutional neural network, U‐Net, and Attention U‐Net models, to simulate precipitation associated with these weather events. The spatial permutation method is also used to identify key meteorological variables for accurately generating precipitation in DL models. The DL models trained on all timeslots consistently surpass the performance of state‐of‐the‐art numerical simulations, although their efficacy slightly diminishes during extreme weather events. This outperformance is attributed to the appropriate emphasis on key variables that capture precipitation processes, such as low‐level moisture and mid‐level pressure fields. However, new DL models trained separately for TCs, MCSs, and ARs using clipped precipitation as the output does not exceed the performance of the previous DL models. Among all input features, moisture variables contribute the most to precipitation at low intensity, while the importance of other variables increases for more intense precipitation, although some discrepancies vary across models and event types. The spatial results further reveal the detailed locations of variables that are essential for accurately simulating precipitation related to weather events, such as areas of high specific humidity and strong winds. DL models could also acquire useful information from region remote to the events to improve the simulation. Overall, DL models serve as promising tools for simulating and enhancing our understanding of precipitation patterns associated with various weather events in East Asia.","",https://doi.org/10.1029/2024jd041914,"",,

  Sentinel-2 Imagery",,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"In Canada's northern regions, linear disturbances such as roads, seismic exploration lines, and pipelines pose a significant threat to the boreal woodland caribou population (Rangifer tarandus). To address the critical need for management of these disturbances, there is a strong emphasis on developing mapping approaches that accurately identify forest habitat fragmentation. The traditional approach is manually generating maps, which is time-consuming and lacks the capability for frequent updates. Instead, applying deep learning methods to multispectral satellite imagery offers a cost-effective solution for automated and regularly updated map production. Deep learning models have shown promise in extracting paved roads in urban environments when paired with high-resolution (<0.5m) imagery, but their effectiveness for general linear feature extraction in forested areas from lower resolution imagery remains underexplored. This research employs a deep convolutional neural network model based on the VGGNet16 architecture for semantic segmentation of lower resolution (10m) Sentinel-2 satellite imagery, creating precise multi-class linear disturbance maps. The model is trained using ground-truth label maps sourced from the freely available Alberta Institute of Biodiversity Monitoring Human Footprint dataset, specifically targeting the Boreal and Taiga Plains ecozones in Alberta, Canada. Despite challenges in segmenting lower resolution imagery, particularly for thin linear disturbances like seismic exploration lines that can exhibit a width of 1-3 pixels in Sentinel-2 imagery, our results demonstrate the effectiveness of the VGGNet model for accurate linear disturbance retrieval.

Accurate measurement of how these pressures alter land cover over time, along with the projection of future changes, is crucial for sustainable management. This study aims to analyse these changes from 2010 to 2020 and predict future scenarios up to 2040 using multi-source remote sensing and machine learning techniques. Optical, radar, and topographical remote sensing data from Landsat-7, Landsat-8, ALOS/PALSAR, and Shuttle Radar Topography Mission derived digital elevation models (DEMs) were integrated to perform land cover change analysis using Random Forest (RF), while Cellular Automata Artificial Neural Networks (CA-ANNs) were employed for predictive modelling. The classification model achieved overall accuracies of 93% in 2010 and 94% in both 2015 and 2020, with weighted F1 scores of 80.0%, 75.8%, and 75.7%, respectively. Validation of the predictive model yielded a Kappa value of 0.70, with an overall accuracy rate of 80%, ensuring reliable spatial predictions of future land cover dynamics. Findings reveal a 12% expansion in peatland cover, equivalent to approximately 6570 ± 308.59 hectares, despite declines in specific peatland types. Concurrently, anthropogenic land uses have increased, evidenced by an 85% rise in rubber plantations (from 30,530 ± 110.96 hectares to 56,617 ± 220.90 hectares) and a 6% reduction in natural forest cover (5965 ± 353.72 hectares). Sparse vegetation, including smallholder farms, decreased by 35% from 45,064 ± 163.79 hectares to 29,424 ± 114.81 hectares.

Three Community Development (CD) Blocks, namely, Contai-I, Deshapran, and Ramnagar-II were considered to analyze the growth pattern of the area under CBA. Landsat datasets of the assessment years (1991, 2001, 2011, 2021, and 2023) were used to prepare the land use/ land cover (LULC) maps and to derive pertinent landscape metrics of patch and class levels for this region.

Additionally, Census Village-wise growth pattern of CBA was analyzed by conducting a spatial autocorrelation analysis which depicted prominent clustering of villages with a higher concentration of CBA. Results showed that there has been an incessant growth of CBA in the last three decades, however, a sharp drop has been recorded owing to recurrent bouts of diseases, swelling production costs, and a sharp drop-in market rate.

The impact of changing climatic conditions on crop yield, particularly for staple crops like wheat, has raised concerns about future food production. By integrating historical climate data, GCM (CMIP3) projections, and wheat-yield records, our analysis aims to provide significant insights into how climate change may affect wheat output. This research uses advanced machine learning models to explore the intricate relationship between climate change and wheat-yield prediction. Machine learning models used include multiple linear regression (MLR), boosted tree, random forest, ensemble models, and several types of ANNs: ANN (multi-layer perceptron), ANN (probabilistic neural network), ANN (generalized feed-forward), and ANN (linear regression). The model was evaluated and validated against yield and weather data from three Punjab, Pakistan, regions (1991–2021). The calibrated yield response model used downscaled global climate model (GCM) outputs for the SRA2, B1, and A1B average collective CO2 emissions scenarios to anticipate yield changes through 2052. Results showed that maximum temperature (R = 0.116) was the primary climate factor affecting wheat yield in Punjab, preceding the Tmin (R = 0.114), while rainfall had a negligible impact (R = 0.000). The ensemble model (R = 0.988, nRMSE= 8.0%, MAE = 0.090) demonstrated outstanding yield performance, outperforming Random Forest Regression (R = 0.909, nRMSE = 18%, MAE = 0.182), ANN(MLP) (R = 0.902, MAE = 0.238, nRMSE = 17.0%), and boosting tree (R = 0.902, nRMSE = 20%, MAE = 0.198).

The expected yield is 5.5% lower than the greatest average yield reported at the site in 2052. The study predicts that site-specific wheat output will experience a significant loss due to climate change. This decrease, which is anticipated to be 5.5% lower than the highest yield ever recorded, points to a potential future loss in wheat output that might worsen food insecurity. Additionally, our findings highlighted that ensemble approaches leveraging multiple model strengths could offer more accurate and reliable predictions under varying climate scenarios. This suggests a significant potential for integrating machine learning in developing climate-resilient agricultural practices, paving the way for future sustainable food security solutions.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/su16166976,"",,

Traditionally, empirical methods are used to calculate the reference evapotranspiration using available meteorological data. However, in many areas, such data is limited or unavailable for ET<sub>o</sub> estimation. Hence, this study aims to explore data-driven models like machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) for estimating ET<sub>o</sub> with minimal meteorological data. In this study, five ML models, including linear regression (LR), random forest (RF), support vector regression (SVR), XGBoost, KNN regression, and two deep learning methods such as feedforward neural networks and long-term short-term memory (LSTM), were used to estimate the reference evapotranspiration (ET<sub>o</sub>) over the Phulnahara canal command area using various combinations of meteorological parameters. The results of these models were compared with the Penman-Monteith-based ET<sub>o</sub>. The Penman-Monteith-based ET<sub>o</sub> exhibits a significant positive correlation with sunshine hour and maximum temperature, displaying correlation coefficients of 0.8 and 0.6, respectively, while RHmin and RHmax demonstrate a negative correlation. The findings revealed that when all climate data is available, the coefficient of determination (R<sup>2</sup>) rises to 0.98. However, when data is limited, it drops to 0.78. The SVR model outperformed other ML models with all input combinations. However, KNN emerged as the most reliable model for estimating ET<sub>o</sub> with input data of maximum and minimum temperature.

rayyan-220232183,Soundscapes and airborne laser scanning identify vegetation density and its interaction with elevation as main driver of bird diversity and community composition,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract Aim Mountain ecosystems are hotspots of biodiversity due to their high variation in climate and habitats. Yet, above average rates of climate change and enhanced forest disturbance regimes alter local climatic conditions and vegetation structure, which should impact biodiversity. We here investigated the impact of vegetation and elevation as well as their interactions on bird communities to improve our ability to predict climate change effects on bird communities. Location European Alps, Germany. Methods We studied patterns and drivers of bird communities at 213 plots along gradients in vegetation density and elevation using autonomous sound recorders. Bird species were identified from soundscapes by Convolutional Neural Networks (BirdNET) and taxonomists. Results Bird diversity and community metrics were moderately to strongly correlated for data based on either identification by BirdNET or taxonomists (Pearson's r = .47–.94), and ecological findings were overall similar for both datasets. Vegetation density 1–2 m and &gt;2 m above ground strongly affected bird diversity and community composition and mediated effects of elevation. Community composition changed with elevation more strongly in habitats with low than high vegetation density &gt;2 m. Species numbers decreased with elevation in habitats with low vegetation density 1–2 m and &gt;2 m above ground, but increased in habitats with high vegetation density. Overall, functional and phylogenetic diversity increased with elevation indicating lower habitat filtering, but patterns were also mediated by vegetation density. Main Conclusions Our results indicate that bird communities in the German Alps are determined by strong interactive effects of elevation and vegetation, underlining the importance to consider variation in vegetation in studies of biodiversity patterns along elevational gradients and under climate change. Combining remote sensing data and biodiversity monitoring based on autonomous sampling and AI‐based species identification opens new avenues for bird monitoring and research in remote areas.","",https://doi.org/10.1111/ddi.13905,"",,

To understand the impact of specific causes or combinations of causes on outcomes, it is essential to identify and establish clear causal relationships. Our study investigates the causal effects of different land use systems against Land Surface Temperature (LST) in Henan Province. We further make land use predictions based on current trends. Understanding these dynamics is essential for enhancing agricultural informatization, environmental management, and climate-smart choices of local districts, counties and villages across China’s agriculturally important regions and beyond. Material and methods The study utilized integrated remote sensing data, techniques and a causality approach to investigate land use systems (LUS) and LST in Henan Province. We further used Modules for Land Use Change Evaluation (MOLUSCE) and Cellular Automata-Artificial Neural Network (CA-ANN) to predict LUS for the near future (2023–2053). Results and conclusions Results revealed that built-up areas (+500%), forests (+50.88%) and water bodies (+83.56%) have expanded massively during the past 40 years. In contrast, cultivated (–20.81%) and barren areas (–60.53%) declined steadily. The temporal causal inference analysis demonstrated a strong convergence between built-up areas and land surface temperature (LST), which substantiates built-up areas’ profound impact on LST intensity. The spatial causal inference analysis shows moderate to robust positive indirect cross-mapping relationships between built-up areas (ρ = 0.63) and bare land (ρ = 0.32) against LST. Land use predictions (2023–2053) show a reduction in areas covered by forests and water bodies, and a reversed trend in cultivated lands. These are particularly important when formulating targeted policy-directives needed to regulate unsustainable land-use processes and undesirable economic trade-offs.","",https://doi.org/10.15576/asp.fc/190971,"",,
rayyan-220232227,Estimating Soybean Yields using Causal Inference and Deep Learning Approaches with Satellite Remote Sensing Data,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Timely and accurate crop yield estimation is crucial for managing crops, trade, and food security. The combination of remote sensing technology with machine learning methods is increasingly popular for global yield prediction. However, traditional machine learning methods rely on data correlation rather than causality, leading to poor interpretability. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach that combines structural causal model (SCM) with deep learning to develop a causal graph attention network model (SCM-GAT) based on causal relationships for soybean yield prediction at the county level of 10 major soybean-producing states in the United States. The SCM-GAT model considers not only conventional vegetation indices and weather variables but also the causal relationships between variables as inputs. Using independent validation and five-fold cross-validation strategies, our results show that the predictive performance of the SCM-GAT model is not only superior to traditional prediction models, such as selection operator regression (LASSO), random forest (RF), but also superior to the common deep learning models based on correlation relationships, such as long short-term memory network (LSTM), and transformer. It is also proved to be more robust than other models under extreme weather events. Additionally, we identify branching to blooming and blooming to setting pods as the key growth phases for soybean yield, and adding these phases as inputs to the model further improves prediction accuracy. Our findings suggest that incorporating causal relationships in deep learning models can improve prediction accuracy. This study provides a novel approach for remote sensing prediction of crop yield.","",https://doi.org/10.1109/jstars.2024.3435699,"",,

Existing methods for studying water turbidity's spatial and temporal distribution rely mostly on measured data. There is limited research on the classification of water bodies with different turbidity levels. The main challenge lies in determining the boundaries of liquid water bodies at various turbidity levels, making it challenging to classify them accurately using traditional remote sensing image classification methods. This paper proposes and validates an intelligent turbidity classification method based on deep learning using GaoFen-1 multispectral remote sensing imagery. An adaptive threshold water extraction method based on the Normalized Difference Water Index is proposed to capture water boundaries more accurately to improve the accuracy of extracting nearshore water bodies. A semi-automatic semantic annotation method for water turbidity is introduced to reduce manual labeling costs. The paper applies mode filtering to address edge noise issues and establishes a high-quality training sample dataset. After comparing the accuracy of various neural network models, DeepLab V3+ is selected for intelligent turbidity classification. The results show high accuracy, with mean intersection over union (MIoU), mean F1 score (MF1), and overall accuracy (OA) reaching 94.73%, 97.29%, and 97.54%, respectively. The proposed method and experiments demonstrate the feasibility of intelligent classification of water bodies with different turbidity levels using deep learning networks.

To understand the impacts on water body change during the rapid urbanization period, this study combines data from the OpenStreetMap platform with Landsat 5/Thematic Mapper images to effectively and accurately identify small urban water bodies. The findings indicate that the trained U-net convolutional neural network (U-Net) water body extraction model and loss function combining Focal Loss and Dice Loss adopted in this study demonstrate high precision in identifying water bodies within the main urban area of Hangzhou, with an accuracy rate of 94.3%. Trends of decrease in water areas with a continuous increase in landscape fragmentation, particularly for the plain river network, were observed from 1985 to 2010, indicating a weaker connection between water bodies resulting from rapid urbanization. Large patches of water bodies, such as natural lakes and big rivers, located at divisions at the edge of the city are susceptible to disappearing during the rapid outward expansion. However, due to the limitations and strict control of development, water bodies, referring to as wetland, slender canals, and plain river networks, in the traditional center division of the city, are preserved well. Combined with the random forest classification method and the U-Net water body extraction model, land use changes from 1985 to 2010 are calculated. Reclamation along the Qiantang River accounts for the largest conversion area between water bodies and cultivated land, constituting more than 90% of the total land use change area, followed by the conversion of water bodies into construction land, particularly in the northeast of Xixi Wetland. Notably, the conversion of various land use types within Xixi Wetland into construction land plays a significant role in the rise of the carbon footprint.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/rs16142579,"",,

Currently, soil moisture is typically measured by installing sensors in the ground or through satellite remote sensing, with data retrieval facilitated by reanalysis models such as the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Reanalysis 5 (ERA5) and the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS). However, the suitability of these methods for capturing local-scale variabilities is insufficiently validated, particularly in regions like South Korea, where land surfaces are highly complex and heterogeneous. In contrast, artificial intelligence (AI) approaches have shown promising potential for soil moisture retrieval at the local scale but have rarely demonstrated substantial products for spatially continuous grids. This paper presents the retrieval of daily soil moisture (SM) over a 500 m grid for croplands in South Korea using random forest (RF) and automated machine learning (AutoML) models, leveraging satellite images and meteorological data. In a blind test conducted for the years 2013–2019, the AutoML-based SM model demonstrated optimal performance, achieving a root mean square error of 2.713% and a correlation coefficient of 0.940. Furthermore, the performance of the AutoML model remained consistent across all the years and months, as well as under extreme weather conditions, indicating its reliability and stability. Comparing the soil moisture data derived from our AutoML model with the reanalysis data from sources such as the European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative (ESA CCI), GLDAS, the Local Data Assimilation and Prediction System (LDAPS), and ERA5 for the South Korea region reveals that our AutoML model provides a much better representation. These experiments confirm the feasibility of AutoML-based SM retrieval, particularly for local agrometeorological applications in regions with heterogeneous land surfaces like South Korea.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/w16182661,"",,

The findings showed significant LULC changes in the Delta, particularly for the mangrove forests and cropland (rice paddies).

Satellite image data are widely used in environmental decision-making to monitor changes in the land surface, but ASMs are difficult to map from space. ASMs are small, irregularly shaped, unevenly distributed, and confused (spectrally) with other land clearance types. To address this issue, we developed a reliable and efficient ASM detection method for the Tapajós River Basin of Brazil—an important gold mining region of the Amazon Rainforest. We enhanced detection in three key ways. First, we used the time-series segmentation (LandTrendr) Google Earth Engine (GEE) Application Programming Interface to map the pixel-wise trajectory of natural vegetation disturbance and recovery on an annual basis with a 2000 to 2019 Landsat image time series. Second, we segmented 26 textural features in addition to 5 spectral features to account for the high spatial heterogeneity in ASM pixels. Third, we trained and tested a Random Forest model to detect ASMs after eliminating irrelevant and redundant features with the Variable Selection Using Random Forests “ensemble of ensembles” technique. The out-of-bag error and overall accuracy of the final Random Forest was 3.73 and 92.6%, which are comparable to studies mapping large industrial mines with the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and LandTrendr. The most important feature in our study was NDVI, followed by textural features in the near and shortwave infrared.

It explores the intricate relationship between population growth and land cover dynamics, aiming to contribute to sustainable land management practices and align with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for 2030. Using a combination of neural network classification and the CA-Markov model, the study analyses historical land cover data to identify significant transformations. Between 1987 and 2018, bare lands increased by 29%, vegetation increased by 14%, built-up areas increased by 128% and waterbodies increased by 10%, whereas there was a 58% decline in the extent of wetlands. The most significant transformation occurred in the wetlands, with a total of 1819.46 km2 being converted to various land cover types. The results demonstrate remarkable shifts characterised by rapid urbanisation, substantial wetland loss and a decline in vegetation cover. Expectedly, population growth is found to be closely linked to the expansion of built-up areas while negatively impacting other land cover types.

It focuses on its operation and outcomes from 2020 to 2022 in the Caatinga biome, a unique Brazilian dryland ecosystem. The primary objectives were to analyze deforestation dynamics, identify areas with highest deforestation rates, and determine regions that require prioritization for anti-deforestation efforts and conservation actions. The research methodology involved utilizing remote sensing data, including Landsat imagery, processed through the Google Earth Engine platform. The data were analyzed using spectral unmixing, adjusted Normalized Difference Fraction Index, and harmonic time series models to generate monthly deforestation alerts. The findings reveal a significant increase in deforestation alerts and deforested areas over the study period, with a 148% rise in alerts from 2020 to 2022. The Caatinga biome was identified as the second highest in detected deforestation alerts in Brazil in 2022, accounting for 18.4% of total alerts. Hexagonal assessments illustrate diverse vegetation cover and alert distribution, enabling targeted conservation efforts. The Bivariate Choropleth Map demonstrates the nuanced relationship between alert and vegetation cover, guiding prioritization for deforestation control and native vegetation restoration. The analysis also highlighted the spatial heterogeneity of deforestation, with most deforestation events occurring in small patches, averaging 10.9 ha. The study concludes that while the dryland alert system (SAD-Caatinga—Phase I) has effectively detected deforestation, ongoing challenges such as cloud cover, seasonality, and more frequent and precise monitoring persist. The implementation of DDAS plays a critical role in sustainable forestry by enabling the prompt detection of deforestation, which supports targeted interventions, helps contain the process, and provides decision makers with early insights to distinguish between legal and illegal practices.

In future research, there will be a focus on the adaptive capacity of mangroves to varying degrees of sea-level rise and the increasing frequency of tropical cyclones, as well as on what measures can be taken to enhance the resilience of mangrove ecosystems. Quantitative and visual analysis of the development trends in this field can provide a reference for the construction of a disaster monitoring platform for mangroves affected by sea-level rise and tropical cyclones, and can aid the development of research aimed at mitigating the impacts of natural disasters. Furthermore, the integration of remote sensing technology and ecological models can facilitate more detailed research, offering more effective tools and strategies for the conservation and management of mangroves. This approach also provides a reference point for developing a monitoring platform for mangrove disasters associated with sea-level rise and the impact of tropical cyclones.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/w16243662,"",,

  Forecasting",,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"In response to climate change, assessing crop productivity under extreme weather conditions is essential to enhance food security. Crop simulation models, which align with physical processes, offer explainability but often perform poorly. Conversely, machine learning (ML) models for crop modeling are powerful and scalable yet operate as black boxes and lack adherence to crop growths physical principles. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel method that combines the strengths of both approaches by estimating the water use and the crop sensitivity to water scarcity at the pixel level. This approach enables yield loss estimation grounded in physical principles by sequentially solving the equation for crop yield response to water scarcity, using an enhanced loss function. Leveraging Sentinel-2 satellite imagery, climate data, simulated water use data, and pixel-level yield data, our model demonstrates high accuracy, achieving an R2 of up to 0.77, matching or surpassing state-of-the-art models like RNNs and Transformers. Additionally, it provides interpretable and physical consistent outputs, supporting industry, policymakers, and farmers in adapting to extreme weather conditions.","",https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2501.00502,"",,

  Swin-Unet with Applications to Area Prediction",,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Lakes provide a wide range of valuable ecosystem services, such as water supply, biodiversity habitats, and carbon sequestration. However, lakes are increasingly threatened by climate change and human activities. Therefore, continuous global monitoring of lake dynamics is crucial, but remains challenging on a large scale. The recently developed Global Lakes Area Database (GLAKES) has mapped over 3.4 million lakes worldwide, but it only provides data at decadal intervals, which may be insufficient to capture rapid or short-term changes.This paper introduces an expanded lake database, GLAKES-Additional, which offers biennial delineations and area measurements for 152,567 lakes globally from 1990 to 2021. We employed the Swin-Unet model, replacing traditional convolution operations, to effectively address the challenges posed by the receptive field requirements of high spatial resolution satellite imagery. The increased biennial time resolution helps to quantitatively attribute lake area changes to climatic and hydrological drivers, such as precipitation and temperature changes.For predicting lake area changes, we used a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network and an extended time series dataset for preliminary modeling. Under climate and land use scenarios, our model achieved an RMSE of 0.317 km^2 in predicting future lake area changes.","",https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2408.10821,"",,
rayyan-220232696,Global drivers of forest loss at 1 km resolution,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Forests are in decline worldwide due to human activities such as agricultural expansion, urbanization, and mineral extraction. Forest loss due to generally temporary causes, such as wildfire and forest management, is important to distinguish from permanent land use conversion due to the differing ecological and climate impacts of these disturbances and for the purposes of developing effective policies and management strategies. Existing global maps of the drivers of forest loss that are widely used are not spatially or thematically detailed enough for decision makers at local-to-regional scales, such as governments, land managers, or companies. Using publicly available satellite observations (Landsat, Sentinel) and ancillary biophysical and population data, we developed a 1 km resolution, global map of the dominant drivers of forest loss from 2001 to 2022 with seven classes: permanent agriculture (e.g., commodity crops or pasture), hard commodities (e.g., mining), shifting cultivation, forest management (e.g., logging or wood fiber plantations), settlements and infrastructure, wildfire, and other natural disturbances. We interpreted nearly 7,000 reference samples to train a global neural network model that classifies the driver of forest loss with an overall accuracy of 90.5%. Our results show that permanent agriculture was the leading driver of forest loss globally, representing 35% of loss from 2001 to 2022. The drivers of forest loss vary by region, with the leading driver identified as forest management in Europe, permanent agriculture across the tropics, and wildfire in Russia, the Asian mainland, North America, and Oceania. Our results enable assessment of forest disturbance dynamics from local to global scales and can support tracking progress towards corporate and governmental zero-deforestation commitments, monitoring deforestation risks within jurisdictions and supply chains, and assessment of global biodiversity targets.","",https://doi.org/10.31223/x5hq6k,"",,

Existing datasets for AGB estimation from satellite imagery are limited. Either they focus on specific, local regions at high resolution, or they offer global coverage at low resolution. There is a need for a machine learning-ready, globally representative, high-resolution benchmark. Our findings indicate significant variability in biomass estimates across different vegetation types, emphasizing the necessity for a dataset that accurately captures global diversity. To address these gaps, we introduce a comprehensive new dataset that is globally distributed, covers a range of vegetation types, and spans several years. This dataset combines AGB reference data from the GEDI mission with data from Sentinel-2 and PALSAR-2 imagery. Additionally, it includes pre-processed high-level features such as a dense canopy height map, an elevation map, and a land-cover classification map. We also produce a dense, high-resolution (10m) map of AGB predictions for the entire area covered by the dataset. Rigorously tested, our dataset is accompanied by several benchmark models and is publicly available.

rayyan-220232717,ML4Fire-XGBv1.0: Improving North American wildfire prediction by integrating a machine-learning fire model in a land surface model,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract. Wildfires have shown increasing trends in both frequency and severity across the Contiguous United States (CONUS). However, process-based fire models have difficulties in accurately simulating the burned area over the CONUS due to a simplification of the physical process and cannot capture the interplay among fire, ignition, climate, and human activities. The deficiency of burned area simulation deteriorates the description of fire impact on energy balance, water budget, and carbon fluxes in the Earth System Models (ESMs). Alternatively, machine learning (ML) based fire models, which capture statistical relationships between the burned area and environmental factors, have shown promising burned area predictions and corresponding fire impact simulation. We develop a hybrid framework (ML4Fire-XGB) that integrates a pretrained eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) wildfire model with the Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) land model (ELM) version 2.1. A Fortran-C-Python deep learning bridge is adapted to support online communication between ELM and the ML fire model. Specifically, the burned area predicted by the ML-based wildfire model is directly passed to ELM to adjust the carbon pool and vegetation dynamics after disturbance, which are then used as predictors in the ML-based fire model in the next time step. Evaluated against the historical burned area from Global Fire Emissions Database 5 from 2001–2020, the ML4Fire-XGB model outperforms process-based fire models in terms of spatial distribution and seasonal variations. Sensitivity analysis confirms that the ML4Fire-XGB well captures the responses of the burned area to rising temperatures. The ML4Fire-XGB model has proved to be a new tool for studying vegetation-fire interactions, and more importantly, enables seamless exploration of climate-fire feedback, working as an active component in E3SM.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-2024-151,"",,

Despite the urgent need to address these challenges, there is limited local-scale monitoring of groundwater withdrawals in most of the groundwater basins in this region. Understanding the volume of groundwater being withdrawn is indispensable for implementing sustainable solutions to tackle water security issues. Hence, developing reliable and efficient groundwater withdrawal monitoring solutions is critical to address the pressing water management concerns in this region. The existing methods for estimating groundwater withdrawals are either costly and time-consuming, or they cannot generate dependable predictions at the scales required for effective local management. While our earlier works on integrating remote sensing and machine learning techniques to estimate gridded (1-5 km) groundwater use in Kansas, Arizona, and the Mississippi Alluvial Plain have been successful, field-scale estimation is still a challenge. Here, we use statistical and machine learning-based approaches to relate field-scale groundwater withdrawals with remote sensing-derived datasets, e.g., Landsat evapotranspiration (ET), downscaled SMAP surface soil moisture, and other hydrometeorological datasets for several Western U.S. states. We apply and test our approach by estimating and comparing groundwater pumping measurements at field- and regional-scales for multiple groundwater basins. Preliminary results using linear regression and machine learning-based approaches in Nevada and Arizona show promise (R2 of 0.5 to 0.7), additional in-situ pumping data actively being compiled will likely improve the models. While there are clear opportunities for model improvements, modeled withdrawal estimates are likely more accurate than common water right duties and potential crop ET-based estimates. We aim to enable water resource and user communities better understand water use, water budgets and support field-scale management practices for metered and unmetered groundwater basins.","",https://doi.org/10.22541/essoar.170688858.81127989/v1,"",,
rayyan-220232930,Optimizing Soil Fertility through Machine Learning: Enhancing Agricultural Productivity and Sustainability,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Nowadays, the sustainability of agriculture and food security have an increasing importance on soil fertility. Soil fertility is defined as the capacity of a land to grow crops and its potential crop productivity. However, factors such as increasing population, climate change, land use changes and environmental pollution threaten soil fertility. These threats can result in problems such as erosion, soil salinisation and organic matter depletion. Soil fertility is critical for the long-term health of agriculture and food security. Artificial intelligence techniques used to determine and manage soil fertility analyse the minerals present in the soil as well as other factors. These analyses assess the amount of minerals present in the soil, the availability of nutrients and important parameters such as pH. This information guides farmers in selecting the most appropriate crops. Furthermore, the integration of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies allows real-time monitoring of minerals and nutrients in the soil and optimising irrigation and fertilisation processes based on this data. These developments have the potential to improve soil fertility management and increase agricultural productivity.","",https://doi.org/10.30516/bilgesci.1532645,"",,

Recently, the Earth observation (EO) field has produced several foundation models pre-trained directly on multispectral satellite imagery (e.g., Sentinel-2) for applications like precision agriculture, wildfire and drought monitoring, and natural disaster response. However, few studies have investigated the ability of these models to generalize to new geographic locations, and potential concerns of geospatial bias -- models trained on data-rich developed countries not transferring well to data-scarce developing countries -- remain. We investigate the ability of popular EO foundation models to transfer to new geographic regions in the agricultural domain, where differences in farming practices and class imbalance make transfer learning particularly challenging. We first select six crop classification datasets across five continents, normalizing for dataset size and harmonizing classes to focus on four major cereal grains: maize, soybean, rice, and wheat. We then compare three popular foundation models, pre-trained on SSL4EO-S12, SatlasPretrain, and ImageNet, using in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) evaluation. Experiments show that pre-trained weights designed explicitly for Sentinel-2, such as SSL4EO-S12, outperform general pre-trained weights like ImageNet. Furthermore, the benefits of pre-training on OOD data are the most significant when only 10--100 ID training samples are used. Transfer learning and pre-training with OOD and limited ID data show promising applications, as many developing regions have scarce crop type labels. All harmonized datasets and experimental code are open-source and available for download.","",https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2409.09451,"",,

In the context of climate change, it is important to monitor the dynamics of the Earth’s surface in order to prevent extreme weather phenomena such as floods and droughts. To this end, global meteorological forecasting is constantly being improved, with a recent breakthrough in deep learning methods. In this paper, we propose to adapt a recent weather forecasting architecture, called GraphCast, to a water resources forecasting task using high-resolution satellite image time series (SITS). Based on an intermediate mesh, the data geometry used within the network is adapted to match high spatial resolution data acquired in two-dimensional space. In particular, we introduce a predefined irregular mesh based on a segmentation map to guide the network’s predictions and bring more detail to specific areas. We conduct experiments to forecast water resources index two months ahead on lakes and rivers in Italy and Spain. We demonstrate that our adaptation of GraphCast outperforms the existing frameworks designed for SITS analysis. It also showed stable results for the main hyperparameter, i.e., the number of superpixels. We conclude that adapting global meteorological forecasting methods to SITS settings can be beneficial for high spatial resolution predictions.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/isprs-archives-xlviii-2-2024-81-2024,"",,

This study introduces a novel canopy radiative transfer model (RTM) by coupling the radiation transfer model for rice leaves (RPIOSL) and unified BRDF model (UBM) models, comparing its simulated canopy hyperspectra with those from the PROSAIL model. Characteristic wavelengths were extracted using Sobol sensitivity analysis and competitive adaptive reweighted sampling methods. Using these wavelengths, rice phenotype estimation models were constructed with back propagation neural network (BPNN), extreme learning machine (ELM), and broad learning system (BLS) methods. The results indicate that the RPIOSL-UBM model’s hyperspectra closely match measured data in the 500–650 nm and 750–1000 nm ranges, reducing the root mean square error (RMSE) by 0.0359 compared to the PROSAIL model. The ELM-based models using the RPIOSL-UBM dataset proved most effective for estimating the LAI and LCC, with RMSE values of 0.6357 and 6.0101 μg· cm−2, respectively. These values show significant improvements over the PROSAIL dataset models, with RMSE reductions of 0.1076 and 6.3297 μg· cm−2, respectively. The findings demonstrate that the proposed model can effectively estimate rice phenotypic parameters from UAV-measured hyperspectral data, offering a new approach to assess rice nutritional status and enhance cultivation efficiency and yield.

In recent decades, much concern has been raised regarding the extent to which forest cover tracks past climate change. Studies at different spatiotemporal scales have revealed significant temporal lags, ranging from decades to millennia, with no consensus reached on this issue.1Dallmeyer A. Kleinen T. Claussen M. et al.The deglacial forest conundrum.Nat.

Commun. 2022; 13: 6035https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-33646-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar It was demonstrated that the simulated expansion of deglacial forest in the NH occurred approximately 4,000 years earlier than the pollen-based reconstruction suggests, even when accounting for the climate change that has occurred over this time period. The climate during the last glacial maximum period (22–19 ka BP [thousands of years before present]) was cold, followed by a significant warming from 19 to 12.9 ka BP, after which the cold period of the Younger Dryas (12.9–11.5 ka BP) occurred (Figures 1Aa–1Ag). Consequently, the simulated forest cover in the NH responded rapidly, experiencing a sharp increase from 18 ka and peaking at approximately 11 ka BP, albeit with a temporary decline during the cold Younger Dryas event. Subsequently, forest cover continuously declined throughout the Holocene (11.5 ka BP to present) (Figure 1Ah). In comparison, the pollen-based reconstructions of forest cover in the NH exhibited a notably different pattern. There was minimal discernible change during 19–12.9 ka BP, followed by a gradual and sustained increase culminating around 7 ka BP, with a gradual decline from 2 ka BP onwards (Figure 1Ai). Forest cover from model simulations and pollen reconstructions do not align with the climate change, and this phenomenon is referred to as the ""deglacial forest conundrum.""1Dallmeyer A. Kleinen T. Claussen M. et al.The deglacial forest conundrum.Nat. Commun. 2022; 13: 6035https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-33646-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar Interestingly, this asynchronous NH forest cover change has mainly been observed in Asia (Figures 1Ah and 1Ai), with no significant differences in the changes of forest cover in Europe or North America (Figure 1Aj).1Dallmeyer A. Kleinen T. Claussen M. et al.The deglacial forest conundrum.Nat. Commun. 2022; 13: 6035https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-33646-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar Factors such as solar radiation, ice cover, and atmospheric carbon dioxide levels have been identified as the primary influencers of temperature and precipitation fluctuations in the NH, which, in turn, have a substantial influence on large-scale forest cover dynamics. However, they are insufficient to interpret the continental difference raised above. The underlying drivers responsible for this intriguing divergence in the response patterns of forest cover across individual continents remain a challenging scientific inquiry that warrants a thorough investigation. Here, we investigated soil moisture as a potential solution to the deglacial forest conundrum. The establishment and growth of forest are more sensitive to soil moisture than precipitation, especially in drought-restricted areas. Based on the high-resolution global woody cover data obtained from Earth observation satellite products, we found that forest cover had a much stronger correlation with soil moisture over Asia than over Europe and North America (Figures 1B and 1C), particularly for sites where the climate conditions are similar to those of the past (i.e., temperatures between 15°C and 26°C, as suggested by Figure 1Ac). Such a relationship is also supported by the modeled soil moisture and reconstructed forest cover for the period of 12.9–7 ka BP, when there was a rapid increase in reconstructed forest cover (Figures 1Ag, 1Ai, and 1C). Although soil moisture can be affected by precipitation, we observed a slightly weaker correlation between forest cover and precipitation compared to the relationship with soil moisture (Figure 1C). There was a much weaker correlation for temperature (Figure 1C). These differences in the strengths of correlations were not observed in Europe or North America. Soil moisture could buffer or decrease the forest cover under the dramatic climate change since the Last Glacial Maximum (Figures 1Ag and Ai). Evidently, many of the pollen-based forest reconstructions did not show a rapid response to the deglacial climate change (Figures 1Aa–1Af and 1Ai). This phenomenon possibly resulted from the soil moisture-temperature relationship, with an increase in temperature intensifying evaporation, ultimately promoting evapotranspiration and leading to a decrease in soil moisture (Figures 1Ac, 1Ae, and 1Ag). Hence, during the deglacial period, climate warming failed to trigger a substantial increase in forest cover during 19–12.9 ka BP due to the soil-regulating effect (Figures 1Ac, 1Ae, 1Ag, and 1Ai). This phenomenon was particularly pronounced during the rapid warming period between 15 and 12.9 ka BP. During the Holocene, temperature decreased from 11.5 ka BP onwards, while reconstructed forest cover peaked around 7 ka BP and then gradually decreased. These unsynchronized changes in temperature and forest cover imply that the increasing precipitation and soil moisture might co-determine the changes in forest cover during the Holocene (Figures 1Ac–1Ag and 1Ai). In contrast, the simulated forest cover kept almost the same pace as the changes in temperature and precipitation from 19 ka BP onwards (Figures 1Ac–1Af and 1Ah). Therefore, soil moisture could be the underlying factor controlling the evolution of forest cover in Asia since the Last Glacial Maximum. Forest cover is highly dependent on soil moisture. The root system of trees must absorb soil water, which is the most direct and fundamental water source for forest growth and distribution.2Miguez-Macho G. Fan Y. Spatiotemporal origin of soil water taken up by vegetation.Nature. 2021; 598: 624-628https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-03958-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar,3Li T. Chen Y.Z.

Such an impact is more pronounced in more arid areas, as indicated by the much higher correlation coefficient between forest cover and soil moisture over arid areas (up to 0.83 for sites with annual precipitation <400–500 mm) compared to humid areas (0.4–0.5 for sites with annual precipitation >500 mm), as shown in the Asian data in Figure 1C. Our findings suggest that by using modern data to interpret past climate-forest interactions, it is possible to understand the paleo forest dynamics, although there are still some limitations. The consideration of soil moisture as a potential factor influencing forest cover has not been fully considered in attempts to understand the deglacial forest conundrum in Asia. Indeed, soil moisture has been overlooked when modeling the interactions between deglacial climate change and forest dynamics. Therefore, we highlighted the significance of soil moisture as a factor affecting the evolution of forest cover in Asia. There is an urgent need for future models and even most climate-forest relationship interpretations to comprehensively incorporate the dynamics of soil water and the resulting impacts, which will advance our understanding of the changes in forest cover.

The application of systematic thinking in the development of research programs in the field of farming, analysis and interpretation of the results of field experiments, including the use of artificial intelligence is substantiated.

In order to develop approaches to scaling the archetypes of farming systems, it is proposed to use the concept of ""geons"" as one of the promising trends in geoinformatics, as well as remote sensing materials. Increasing biodiversity, in particular diversification, may be one of the main approaches to overcome the negative impacts of chemical-technogenic intensification on nature. Strategies for diversifying cropping systems are implemented through crop rotations, associated plant species (cover crops, trap crops, repellent crops, buffer crops), mixture of varieties and crops, agroforestry and formation of agro-landscape heterogeneity. As part of the adaptation of farming systems to potential climate change, it is useful to integrate knowledge from quantitative climate models and farming system archetype models for use in digital farming management systems ""on the ground"".

This study developed a cloud computing framework to process time series of synthetic aperture radar (Sentinel 1-SAR) and optical sensor (Landsat 8, Sentinel 2) data to characterize WD in 166 lakes across Massachusetts, USA, during 2016–2021. Comparisons with in situ logger data showed that the Sentinel 1-derived surface water area captured relative water-level fluctuations indicative of WD. A machine learning approach classified lakes as WD versus non-WD based on seasonal water-level fluctuations derived from Sentinel 1-SAR data. The framework mapped WD lakes statewide, revealing prevalence throughout Massachusetts with interannual variability. Results showed WDs occurred in over 75% of lakes during the study period, with high interannual variability in the number of lakes conducting WD. Mean WD magnitude was highest in the wettest year (2018) but % lake area exposure did not show any association with precipitation and varied between 8% to 12% over the 5-year period. WD start date was later and duration was longer in wet years, indicating climate mediation of WD implementation driven by management decisions. The data and tools developed provide an objective information resource to evaluate ecological impacts and guide management of this prevalent but understudied phenomenon. Overall, the results and interactive web tool developed as part of this study provide new hydrologic intelligence to inform water management and policies related to WD practices.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/rs16060947,"",,
rayyan-220233104,Illuminating patterns of firefly abundance using citizen science data and machine learning models,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"As insect populations decline in many regions, conservation biologists are increasingly tasked with identifying factors that threaten insect species and developing effective strategies for their conservation. One insect group of global conservation concern are fireflies (Coleoptera: Lampyridae). Although quantitative data on firefly populations are lacking for most species, anecdotal reports suggest that some firefly populations have declined in recent decades. Researchers have hypothesized that North American firefly populations are most threatened by habitat loss, pesticide use, and light pollution, but the importance of these factors in shaping firefly populations has not been rigorously examined at broad spatial scales. Using data from >24,000 surveys (spanning 2008-16) from the citizen science program Firefly Watch, we trained machine learning models to evaluate the relative importance of a variety of factors on bioluminescent firefly populations: pesticides, artificial lights at night, land cover, soil/topography, short-term weather, and long-term climate. Our analyses revealed that firefly abundance was driven by complex interactions among soil conditions (e.g., percent sand composition), climate/weather (e.g., growing degree days), and land cover characteristics (e.g., percent agriculture and impervious cover). Given the significant impact that climactic and weather conditions have on firefly abundance, there is a strong likelihood that firefly populations will be influenced by climate change, with some regions becoming higher quality and supporting larger firefly populations, and others potentially losing populations altogether. Collectively, our results support hypotheses related to factors threatening firefly populations, especially habitat loss, and suggest that climate change may pose a greater threat than appreciated in previous assessments. Thus, future conservation of North American firefly populations will depend upon 1) consistent and continued monitoring of populations via programs like Firefly Watch, 2) efforts to mitigate the impacts of climate change, and 3) insect-friendly conservation practices.","",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.172329,"",,
rayyan-220233116,Habitat niches of bird species along a recovery gradient in the Chocó tropical forest,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Conservation programs need improved tools to measure the recovery of animal diversity across restoration gradients. We used soundscapes and expert identifications of bird species to calculate niche position (i.e., mean of environmental conditions across all areas a species occupies) and niche breadth (i.e., the standard deviation of the species distribution) along a recovery gradient; from agriculture to early (up to 20 yrs) and late (up to 38 yrs) recovery, to old-growth forests. Our survey included 323 bird species and was conducted in 66 plots in the lowland Chocoan tropical rainforest in Ecuador where less than 11% of the forest remains intact, and large areas are currently undergoing regeneration post-abandonment. First, we validated our niche metrics by contrasting them against independent global categories of forest density dependency. We then explained the niche metrics of the bird species with different ecological traits, gathered from the literature, reflecting species-specific primary diet, morphology and distribution, and accounting for the phylogenetic relatedness of species. Finally, we explored the phylogenetic signal present in bird species' ecological traits and recovery niche metrics. Niche position and breadth across the recovery gradient closely followed global categories of forest density dependency. However, our approach provided a more fine-scaled sorting of bird species in forest plots categorized as late recovery and old-growth. Granivorous birds occupied niche positions in active cacao and pasture plots and were replaced by frugivorous birds in older regeneration plots. Along the recovery gradient, tail length and handwing index decreased with niche position, supporting previous observations that birds in old-growth forests are less mobile. Birds in old-growth forests had smaller global distribution ranges than birds in agricultural plots. Finally, the latitudinal distribution of birds in the study area averaged south of the equator, with birds in old-growth plots averaging latitudinal centroids in wet forests north of the equator, whereas birds in agriculture plots averaged latitudinal centroids further south of the country, towards the dry and open Tumbesian forest. Frugivores, invertivores and vertivores had broader niche breadths, but these decreased (marginally) with tail length. We suggest these recovery niche metrics as a potentially powerful tool for the rapid assessment of the recovery process, which might support conservation strategies such as biodiversity credits, compensation payments, and strategic land purchases. With the increasing availability of information-intensive models for bird species identification, such as deep learning artificial intelligence, our new niche metrics open the avenue for rapid assessment of tropical biodiversity and new conservation areas at larger scales.","",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2024.112260,"",,
rayyan-220233130,Harnessing the Power of AI for Climate Change Impact Assessment,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Climate change impact assessment is critical for creating adequate climate change mitigation and adaptation policies and plans. Critical infrastructure systems (e.g., water and energy systems) are particularly at risk for climate change impacts. In fact, a better understanding of climate change impacts on the water and energy systems would facilitate the fulfillment of SDG2 (end hunger), SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation), SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy), SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities), and SDG 13 (climate action), with many indirect benefits across many other areas. Nonetheless, conducting climate change impact assessment, particularly at the community-level, is not an easy task. Often, the impact assessment models require access to substantial computational resources to run the complex models, as well as the expertise to work with those models and interpret their results, which may not be possible for all communities. As such, there is a need to expand climate change impact assessment to include more accessible models that can handle high-resolution, local data that is of interest to communities. Here, we highlight how climate impact assessment studies can benefit from the power of artificial intelligence (AI). The report details the use of AI model to conduct a computationally efficient climate change impact assessment. This model is applied to a case study across the United States of America (U.S.) as an example to showcase the insights it generates in real-world applications. To demonstrate this process, the study will focus on the impacts on coupled water and electricity demand (e.g., the water-electricity demand nexus). To conduct the impact assessment, the report demonstrates two different means of collecting future climate data—Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5 (CMIP5) Earth System Models (ESMs) and contemporary climate analogs. Our results show significant increases across the Midwestern U.S. when using ESM-derived data. Similar results were found through the climate analog-derived data, suggesting that the analogs can be used successfully as proxies for traditional ESM data in communities that might not have access to the larger CMIP suite of models. Understanding the impacts of climate change on critical infrastructure is important for building sustainable and equitable policies for climate change mitigation and adaptation. These infrastructure systems are often interconnected (e.g., the water-energy nexus) and managed by local entities. Thus, while climate change is a global problem requiring cooperation across countries and sectors, many solutions require local action. In this sense, the results presented here can be used to deepen our scientific understanding of climate change impacts on the water-energy nexus, as well as develop novel methodologies that integrate AI with traditional climate change impact assessment to better prepare local communities for the future.","",https://doi.org/10.53328/inr24ror012,"",,
rayyan-220233143,The Benefit of Coralline Algae Science to Elevate Ocean Literacy,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Marine habitats will face a growing number of pressures in the coming decades because of anthropogenically induced climate change, ocean warming and ocean acidification, biodiversity shifts and overexploitation (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 2023). Effective engagement of scientific research beyond academia is crucial for maximising the resilience of nature to these global challenges (Herbert-Read et al. 2022). Ocean literacy is a fundamental first step towards global marine science education, research and effective conservation of ecologically important ecosystems (Santoro et al. 2017; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 2013). Here, we provide some examples (not an exhaustive list) of recent outreach initiatives across multiple media types that were designed to elevate public knowledge about coralline algae—globally distributed calcified red seaweeds—and their associated habitats, known as coralline algae reefs, maerl beds or rhodolith beds. Placed within the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission of UNESCO (IOC/UNESCO) Ocean Literacy Framework (Santoro et al. 2017) and aligned to the seven 'Essential Principles of Ocean Literacy' (Box 1), we show that coralline algae are an excellent basis for elevating ocean literacy at local, regional and global scales and transcending diverse public groups. An ocean-literate person understands the Essential Principles and Fundamental Concepts about the ocean; can communicate about the ocean in a meaningful way; and is able to make informed and responsible decisions regarding the ocean and its resources. Principle 1: Earth has one big ocean with many features. Principle 2: The ocean and life in the ocean shape the features of Earth. Principle 3: The ocean is a major influence on weather and climate. Principle 4: The ocean makes Earth habitable. Principle 5: The ocean supports a great diversity of life and ecosystems. Principle 6: The ocean and humans are inextricably interconnected. Principle 7: The ocean is largely unexplored. Coralline algae are present in all the ocean basins with global distribution. Public engagement centred around coralline algae therefore opens up the opportunity for bringing in global scale ocean literacy concepts. In 2022, Costa et al. published an accessible introduction to rhodoliths in the journal Frontiers for Young Minds (Figure 1a)—an alternative academic journal that includes children as peer reviewers and input from mentors and teachers. This paper provides an accessible introduction to rhodoliths, targeted towards younger audiences (but with relevance for all ages), engaging participation in the scientific process from a young age and inspiring the next generation of scientists. Key concepts and terminologies were introduced, such as the importance and implications of their global distribution, with local context of searching for 'redstones' or 'rhodoliths' at the beach, how coralline algae act as 'bioengineers', their role in 'blue carbon' and the importance of conserving these unique habitats for future prosperity. We suggest that through increasing the number of popular science articles about coralline algal research, it is possible to bolster the public understanding of the occurrence and global significance of coralline algal habitats. Encouraging widespread distribution of these articles via social media and other outlets will enable coordinated global scale reach. Marine science documentaries can inspire, educate and transform complex scientific concepts and serve to be informative tools in science communication (Staaterman et al. 2014). Biogenic maerl beaches are geologically significant, with rhodoliths found frequently in Cenozoic deposits and through the formation of recent sedimentological micro-habitats such as maerl subaqueous dunes (mega-ripples) as well as biogenic gravel beaches composed of fossilised maerl debris (Freiwald 1995; Joshi 2016). Therefore, they have proven to be a useful example to illustrate Principle 2—where biology and geology meet. The Trá an Doílín beach in county Galway, Ireland, is popularly known as the 'Coral Strand' in the local community and frequently mistaken to be composed of coral, not coralline algae. To elevate coralline algae ocean literacy and to preserve local knowledge previously unrecorded, Dr Siddhi Joshi led the direction and production of an hour-long documentary 'Maerl: A Rare Seabed Habitat'. In this, focusing on Ireland's maerl beds, the documentary covered a diverse range of multidisciplinary maerl research spanning botany, zoology, habitat mapping, conservation management, geology, hydrographic surveying and geophysics (Joshi and Documentary Team 2014; Figure 1b). Through a series of interviews with coralline algae/maerl experts, this documentary was able to show how stakeholders and coastal communities are affected by anthropogenic activities that target maerl bed, including commercial extraction, dredging, salmon farming and bottom trawling, now freely available on the 'Seabed Habitats' collaborative research blog (seabedhabitats.org). Through a film screening on Aran Island in county Galway, west of Ireland (at Inisheer Film Festival), the film helped raise local awareness of the presence and conservation significance of maerl, in light of a previous salmon farm proposal in a neighbouring local area. Attendees included local fishermen and conservation groups, tourists and marine scientists. Another locally significant maerl documentary is 'Pink Maerl and Salmon Farms– Scotland's Barrier Reef' (Little Green Island Films 2023), inspired by the rising citizen science movement to protect maerl beds in Scotland (Hall-Spencer and Rasmusson 2024; Figure 1c). Receiving more than 2000 views from around the world, these video documentaries have given regional coralline algal science a global public platform. Biogeochemistry can be easily left behind in public engagement by not being as charismatic or broadly understood as other topics like biodiversity (Sutton et al. 2013). However, their known importance as a globally important pool of dimethylated sulphur (Burdett, Hatton, and Kamenos 2015) has been showcased in public settings, including in a headline talk by Dr Heidi Burdett at the 2019 New Scientist Live—one of the largest science festivals in the world with more than 40,000 attendees, mostly of school age (Figure 1d). Dimethylated sulphur is important for weather and climate because of the role it may play in local-regional climate regulation through the stimulation of cloud formation (Hopkins et al. 2023). The longevity of coralline algae and the complexity of their calcium carbonate skeleton means they are excellent recorders of past climate, allowing us to reconstruct Holocene environmental change and identify the impacts of human activity. Research led by Dr Branwen Williams on Arctic coralline climate reconstruction has been featured by National Geographic, with a video on YouTube (link here) that has received 46,000 views from around the world (Figure 1e; Williams, personal communication). Marine photosynthesis supports almost all ocean life, and coralline algae have been recorded at deeper depths than any other alga in the ocean (Gattuso et al. 2006). The extraordinary ability for coralline algae to photosynthesise under a huge range of light environments has been a recent research focus (e.g., Krieger et al. 2023; Voerman et al. 2023; Voerman et al. 2022). However, photosynthesis—especially in the ocean—can be an abstract concept to understand. Since 2019, Dr Heidi Burdett in collaboration with Dekko Comics (dekkocomics.com) has used science comics as a medium to start conversations and increase knowledge about coralline algal photosynthesis. Drawing on the known benefits of science comics with visual design, narratives and metaphors (Farinella 2018), more than 6000 copies of this comic have been distributed around the world (as of May 2024) in schools, museums, music festivals, and more (Figure 1f). Known to increase engagement, learning motivation and improve understanding of STEM subjects, science comics are a valuable but underexplored genre in science communication. Scientific illustrations have also been suggested by rhodolith researchers in Costa Rica to help communicate the importance of rhodoliths to different age groups and to rangers of marine protected areas (MPAs), so they can identify rhodoliths in their conservation areas. The group is actively involved in talks to university students, courses for the nonscientific population about algae where this topic is included, as well as education for tourism companies so they can recognise the beds and the ecosystem services they provide (Fernández García, personal communication). Coralline algal habitats are one of the ocean's most biodiverse ecosystems (Tuya et al. 2023). They therefore present an opportunity to showcase Nature's biodiversity beyond the more commonly targeted ecosystems such as coral reefs or rainforests. Art–science collaboration, such as Julia Barton's maerl-themed 'Littoral Art Project' and performance exhibition (littoralartproject.com), is one novel example which utilised dance as an art-form to communicate the diversity of coralline algae ecosystems. Using personifications of a crab, sea cucumber and octopus to artistically explore the maerl habitat, the threats of anthropogenic activities such as dredging and the 'sanctuary' can be provided by MPAs. Marine citizen science is a growing method for improving ocean literacy and has now reached out to coralline algae. In Scotland, for example, citizen science initiatives via Seasearch (www.seasearch.org.uk) have helped to increase biodiversity records on maerl beds and improve conservation policy compliance (Hall-Spencer and Rasmusson 2024). Maerl is a celebrated commodity in some parts of the world. For example, the 'Fête du maerl' cultural festival takes place every 4 years in Brittany with more than 5000 attendees. Historically, maerl was used as a soil conditioner for treating acidic soils in the region; extraction of maerl from the seabed therefore had the dual benefit of supporting fertile agricultural land and a fishing industry (Figure 1g). Over time then, maerl has had an inextricable link to human socioeconomic and cultural values that continues to live on in conservation initiatives and museum exhibitions (e.g., Óceanopolis aquarium in Brest; www.oceanopolis.com/en). At a global scale, coralline algae have also been a leading feature of local initiatives around the world within the Global Seaweed-SUPERSTAR Project (https://globalseaweed.org/). For example, the project has capacity-building initiatives in Tanzania, Malaysia and the Philippines to improve seaweed (including coralline algae) taxonomic identification skills in the local community and to identify diseases. These efforts are communicated via policy briefs and guidance videos for publics and industry. Despite their ecological, biogeochemical, socioeconomic and cultural importance and global ubiquity, coralline algae and their associated habitats remain poorly studied (Tuya et al. 2023). Even now, our knowledge about their distribution remains patchy. Public engagement with coralline algae citizen science initiatives hold promise for scaling-up our exploration and distributional recording of coralline algae habitats (Hall-Spencer and Rasmusson 2024). This can be further facilitated by public networks such as the Irish Ocean Literacy Network (irishoceanliteracy.ie) and combined ocean mapping-outreach initiatives such as the 'Real Map of Ireland'—which showcases the tremendous progress we have made in recent years to map our ocean floors and identify new habitats such as maerl beds. Through participation in international conferences (COLACMAR, SOFILAC), data on rhodolith beds in Costa Rica have been translated into maps showing conservation gaps at the national level. This helps to additionally augment the research efforts studying fossil and recent rhodoliths from Central America (Caribbean and Pacific), with the aim of identifying the main species (from a morphological and genetic perspective), analysing their historical biogeography, describing their development environments and generating conservation recommendations (Fernández García, personal communication). Embracing emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence is crucial if coralline algae science is to keep pace with other disciplines. It is here where innovation in coralline algal public engagement can build on its foundation, looking forward to our next generation of coralline algal scientists, conservationists, policymakers and advocates. A first step towards this can be seen in the NASA NeMO-Net videogame (van den Bergh et al. 2021; nemonet.info; Figure 1h) where seabed classification (of, for example, coral reefs and coralline algae) feeds into a neural network to progress and improve habitat mapping. In this citizen science for the digital age, users are trained in seabed classification on virtual dives by a Remotely Operated Vehicle. Having reached more than 300 million people within 7 months of launch (van den Bergh et al. 2021), it is clear that digital engagement holds great potential for widespread engagement in both ocean and technology literacy. We hope to see more innovations in this space with particular emphasis on co-creating with educators' materials, resources and information. Most people only engage with the ocean through the visual of the flat ocean surface, suggesting calm and nothingness underneath (Williams, personal communication). Visualising the ocean as a three-dimensional or more dynamic four-dimensional changing environment is therefore of crucial importance and may be achieved using emerging technologies such as ocean digital twins—a current multimillion Euro priority for the European Commission (European Commission 2022). Activities that highlight how complex the ocean is and integral to our earth science is important. This is done particularly well through engaging storytelling, including high-quality visuals—several examples of which we have highlighted here. Language and illiteracy barriers should be overcome through translation of resources to local language(s) and a focus on non–text-based engagement materials. Coralline algae-specific resources are sparse compared to other habitats and species—here we demonstrate that redressing this balance can help us to advance local–global ocean literacy. Permissions are granted for the use of images in Figure 1, where necessary. The authors would like to thank Cindy Fernández García and Branwen Williams for their contributions to the global examples included for the ocean literacy principles and two anonymous reviewers for improving the quality of the final manuscript.

rayyan-220233161,Probabilistic Estimation of Tropical Cyclone Intensity Based on Multi-Source Satellite Remote Sensing Images,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Estimating the intensity of tropical cyclones (TCs) is beneficial for preventing and reducing the impact of natural disasters. Most existing methods for estimating TC intensity utilize single-satellite or single-band remote sensing images, but they lack the ability to quantify the uncertainty of the estimation results. However, TC, as a typical chaotic system, often requires confidence intervals for intensity estimates in real-world emergency decision-making scenarios. Additionally, the use of multi-source image inputs contributes to the uncertainty of the model. Consequently, this study introduces a neural network (MTCIE) that utilizes multi-source satellite images to provide probabilistic estimates of TC intensity. The model utilizes infrared and microwave images from multiple satellites as inputs. It uses a dual-branch self-attention encoder to extract TC image features and provides uncertainty estimates for TC intensity. Furthermore, a dataset for estimating the intensity of multi-source TC remote sensing images (MTCID) is constructed through the registration of latitude, longitude, and time, along with data augmentation. The proposed method achieves a MAE of 7.42 kt in deterministic estimation, comparable to mainstream networks like TCIENet. In uncertain estimation, it outperforms methods like MC Dropout in the PICP metric, providing reliable probability estimates. This supports TC disaster emergency decision making, enhancing risk mitigation in real-world applications.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/rs16040606,"",,
rayyan-220233174,Controls on spatial and temporal variability of soil moisture across a heterogeneous boreal forest landscape,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract. In the light of climate change and biodiversity loss, modeling and mapping soil moisture at high spatiotemporal resolution is increasingly crucial for a wide range of applications in Earth and environmental sciences, particularly in areas like boreal forests where comprehensive soil moisture datasets are scarce. Soil moisture, though a small fraction of Earth’s water, plays a fundamental role in terrestrial ecosystem dynamics, influencing meteorological processes, plant health, soil biogeochemistry, groundwater fluctuations, and nutrient exchanges at the land-atmosphere interface. However, understanding and modeling soil moisture dynamics is extremely complex due to the non-linear interplay of numerous physical and biological processes, the large number of drivers involved, and the wide range of spatial and temporal scales at play. Here, we focused on a boreal forest landscape in northern Sweden, where we monitored surface soil moisture with dataloggers at 82 locations during the 2022 vegetation period. We described spatial patterns and temporal fluctuations of soil moisture, we explored the relationships between the observed variations in soil moisture and a vast array of environmental and meteorological factors from multiple sources at varying spatial resolutions and temporal scales, and we tested how these relationships changed over time. Soil properties, topographical features, vegetation characteristics, and land use/land cover were all important contributors of spatial variations in soil moisture, suggesting that current soil moisture maps primarily relying on terrain indices could benefit from integrating this diverse range of information. Moreover, different spatial resolutions and user-defined thresholds of these indices largely affected the performance of the predictions, indicating that topographic proxies for soil moisture should be evaluated for the specific area of interest. Hydrological and meteorological conditions over five to seven days preceding soil moisture measurements were essential in explaining daily soil moisture fluctuations, and influenced the predominant mechanisms governing the spatial distribution of soil moisture. Our findings contribute to advancing physically based land surface and hydrological models, developing machine learning models for predicting spatiotemporal variability in soil moisture, and ultimately generating digital dynamic soil moisture maps for forest management and nature conservation.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-2909,"",,

Following recent advancements in deep learning for processing Landsat archive data, prior studies have released high-resolution historical land cover maps on a global scale. However, these works often present prediction results limited to specific periods of coverage, which hinders their utility in conducting time series analysis across different urban agglomerations. To address this issue, we propose deep-learning models for land cover classification from Landsat images at a 30-meter spatial resolution. Our models are specifically designed for urban areas and are trained to be compatible with the sensors used in the Landsat series from 1972 to the present. Experimental results demonstrate that our models are highly effective in predicting land cover maps in new cities, particularly in built-up land and water regions. Our research provides pretrained models for land cover classification, facilitating future studies in related fields.","",https://doi.org/10.2208/journalofjsce.23-16151,"",,

The satellite images of Earth are gathered, evaluated, and processed for use in civil and military applications with a military aim. Satellite images do have a wide range of services. The areas of study of agriculture, fishery, oceanography, and meteorology include geology, biodiversity, cartography, land use planning, and armed conflict. Transformation is the goal of the categorization of satellite images. Transformation of satellite images into information that can be used rather than having an image of a location. This paper classified a scene of the Landsat-8 satellites with specifications (Path=168 and Row=38). This scene was classified into four categories (Water, Vegetation, bare land, and Build-up) based on the unsupervised classification method (ISO Clustering). The ISO Clustering method is found in the Arc Map program.

rayyan-220233278,Discriminating Seagrasses from Green Macroalgae in European Intertidal Areas Using High-Resolution Multispectral Drone Imagery,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Coastal areas support seagrass meadows, which offer crucial ecosystem services, including erosion control and carbon sequestration. However, these areas are increasingly impacted by human activities, leading to habitat fragmentation and seagrass decline. In situ surveys, traditionally performed to monitor these ecosystems, face limitations on temporal and spatial coverage, particularly in intertidal zones, prompting the addition of satellite data within monitoring programs. Yet, satellite remote sensing can be limited by too coarse spatial and/or spectral resolutions, making it difficult to discriminate seagrass from other macrophytes in highly heterogeneous meadows. Drone (unmanned aerial vehicle—UAV) images at a very high spatial resolution offer a promising solution to address challenges related to spatial heterogeneity and the intrapixel mixture. This study focuses on using drone acquisitions with a ten spectral band sensor similar to that onboard Sentinel-2 for mapping intertidal macrophytes at low tide (i.e., during a period of emersion) and effectively discriminating between seagrass and green macroalgae. Nine drone flights were conducted at two different altitudes (12 m and 120 m) across heterogeneous intertidal European habitats in France and Portugal, providing multispectral reflectance observation at very high spatial resolution (8 mm and 80 mm, respectively). Taking advantage of their extremely high spatial resolution, the low altitude flights were used to train a Neural Network classifier to discriminate five taxonomic classes of intertidal vegetation: Magnoliopsida (Seagrass), Chlorophyceae (Green macroalgae), Phaeophyceae (Brown algae), Rhodophyceae (Red macroalgae), and benthic Bacillariophyceae (Benthic diatoms), and validated using concomitant field measurements. Classification of drone imagery resulted in an overall accuracy of 94% across all sites and images, covering a total area of 467,000 m2. The model exhibited an accuracy of 96.4% in identifying seagrass. In particular, seagrass and green algae can be discriminated. The very high spatial resolution of the drone data made it possible to assess the influence of spatial resolution on the classification outputs, showing a limited loss in seagrass detection up to about 10 m. Altogether, our findings suggest that the MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI) onboard Sentinel-2 offers a relevant trade-off between its spatial and spectral resolution, thus offering promising perspectives for satellite remote sensing of intertidal biodiversity over larger scales.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/rs16234383,"",,
rayyan-220233330,Deep Generative Data Assimilation in Multimodal Setting,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Robust integration of physical knowledge and data is key to improve computational simulations, such as Earth system models. Data assimilation is crucial for achieving this goal because it provides a systematic framework to calibrate model outputs with observations, which can include remote sensing imagery and ground station measurements, with uncertainty quantification. Conventional methods, including Kalman filters and variational approaches, inherently rely on simplifying linear and Gaussian assumptions, and can be computationally expensive. Nevertheless, with the rapid adoption of data-driven methods in many areas of computational sciences, we see the potential of emulating traditional data assimilation with deep learning, especially generative models. In particular, the diffusion-based probabilistic framework has large overlaps with data assimilation principles: both allows for conditional generation of samples with a Bayesian inverse framework. These models have shown remarkable success in text-conditioned image generation or image-controlled video synthesis. Likewise, one can frame data assimilation as observation-conditioned state calibration. In this work, we propose SLAMS: Score-based Latent Assimilation in Multimodal Setting. Specifically, we assimilate in-situ weather station data and ex-situ satellite imagery to calibrate the vertical temperature profiles, globally. Through extensive ablation, we demonstrate that SLAMS is robust even in low-resolution, noisy, and sparse data settings. To our knowledge, our work is the first to apply deep generative framework for multimodal data assimilation using real-world datasets; an important step for building robust computational simulators, including the next-generation Earth system models.

This study investigated multiple machine-learning (ML) model approaches for heatwave occurrence prediction with long lead times of one to five months based on explanatory atmospheric and land surface features. Five ML classifiers were built using Google Earth Engine remote sensing datasets to predict heatwaves at national scale (Sweden) based on 16 features referring to the period of 1989–2019. Extreme Gradient Boosting performed best for lead times of one month (F1-score = 0.63, accuracy = 0.81) and four months (F1-score = 0.54, accuracy = 0.79), while K-Nearest Neighbour was best for lead times of two, three and five months (respective F1-score = 0.63, 0.65, 0.49, accuracy = 0.77, 0.79, 0.78). When applying the SHapley Additive exPlanations technique for model interpretation, land surface features emerged as more impactful heatwave predictors than atmospheric features at longer lead times. More frequent heatwave occurrence was associated with places in Sweden characterized by lower values of geopotential height, latitude, topographical slope, evaporation, precipitation and cropland area, and higher values of average temperature, mean sea level pressure, and southerly and westerly winds. The study also concretely exemplifies how use of this multi-model ML method can enhance predictions and further step-wise improve them, thereby facilitating earlier warning in support of better planning of measures to mitigate adverse heatwave impacts, up to several months ahead of their possible occurrence.","",https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-5267311/v1,"",,

This study investigates the integration of spaceborne Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) LiDAR data with optical imagery from Linear Imaging Self Scanning Sensor (LISS IV), Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and PALSAR data for continuous forest canopy height mapping in Kaziranga National Park (KNP), Assam for the years 2018 and 2022. Four machine learning models were trained and evaluated to assess the predictive ability of LISS IV data in conjunction with SAR variables. The mean canopy height was measured at approximately 8.58 m in 2018, which increased to about 9.07m in 2022. Results reveal Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) as the top-performing model, achieving an RMSE of 5.47m and an R2 of 0.55. In comparison, Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) achieved RMSE values of 5.49, 5.51, and 5.73, respectively. Analysis shows a prevalent occurrence of canopy heights below 5 meters in KNP (more than 35% of the area), while taller canopies beyond 20m can be found in less than 5% of the area. This finding underscores the importance of integrating satellite data and machine learning and highlights the novel application of LISS IV data in enhancing canopy height mapping. Furthermore, it represents the first comprehensive attempt to map canopy height in KNP, laying the groundwork for further research on biomass assessment and carbon sequestration in this vital biodiversity hotspot. Overall, the study highlights the potential of leveraging advanced remote sensing technologies and machine learning approaches for improved understanding and management of forest ecosystems.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/isprs-annals-x-3-2024-39-2024,"",,
rayyan-220233420,A comparison of approaches to quantify carbon for ecosystem service assessments through time,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Monitoring of global climate regulation ecosystem services is needed to inform national accounts, meet emission targets, and evaluate nature-based climate solutions. As carbon monitoring is context-dependent, the most useful methodological approach will depend on the spatial extent and resolution, temporal frequency, baseline, available data, funding, and dominant drivers of change, all of which will impact results and interpretation. Here, focusing on above and belowground carbon storage and sequestration, we review four groups of methods for estimating trends in carbon over time: (1) field-based measurements, (2) land cover maps with reference carbon values by land cover type, (3) statistical and machine learning models linking field measurements to remotely sensed data, and (4) mass balance models representing key carbon pools and flows between them. We discuss strengths, limitations, and best practices for each method to assist researchers in implementing an approach or critically evaluating whether an existing carbon dataset can be used for a different project. The best methods often account for spatial variability of carbon, ecosystem interconnections, and temporal stability of carbon stocks against future environmental changes. Effective carbon monitoring can help determine optimal conservation, restoration, and/or land management interventions with win-win outcomes for both conservation and nature-based climate solutions.","",https://doi.org/10.1139/facets-2023-0053,"",,
rayyan-220233432,Explainable Machine Learning to Map the Impact of Weather and Soil on Wheat Yield and Revenue Across the Eastern Australian Grain Belt,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Understanding the causes of spatiotemporal variation in crop yields across large areas is important in closing yield gaps and producing more food for the growing global population. While there has been much focus on using data-driven models to predict crop yield, there is also an opportunity to use these empirical models to understand which factors are driving variations in yield and to quantify their contributions. This study uses a large database of 625 rainfed wheat yield maps from 14 different seasons (2007–2020) across the eastern grain belt of Australia. XGBoost models were used, with predictors including maps of soil attributes (e.g., pH and sodicity), along with weather indices (rainfall, frost, heat, growing degree days). The model and predictors could accurately predict field-scale yield, with a Lin’s concordance correlation coefficient (LCCC) of 0.78 with 10-fold cross-validation. SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP), a form of interpretive machine learning (IML), values were then used to assess the impact of the variables on yield. The SHAP values for each predictor were also mapped onto a grid of the study area for the 2020 season, which showed the impact of each predictor on wheat yield (t ha−1) and revenue (AUD ($) ha−1) in interpretable units. Weather variables, such as rainfall and heat events, had the largest impact on yield. Although generally less significant, soil constraints such as soil sodicity were still important in driving yield. The results also showed that despite their largely temporally stable nature, soil constraints impact yield differently, depending on seasonal conditions. Overall, data-driven models and IML proved valuable in understanding the impact of important weather and soil variables on wheat yield and revenue across the eastern Australian grain belt. This could be used to determine the magnitude and economic impact of soil constraints and extreme weather on crops across regions and to inform policies and farm management decisions.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/agriculture14122318,"",,
rayyan-220233437,Multi-Sensor Satellite Data Analysis for Urban Land Use Pattern Recognition,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract A global phenomenon, urbanization is characterized by the expansion of cities and rapid growth of urban areas. As cities continue to grow, assessing the distribution and trends in land use is increasingly essential to identify, connect, quantify, validate, and predict the negative consequences of urban areas on the environment. In recent decades, the availability of multi-sensor data has revolutionized and emerged as a promising approach for improving efficiency and precision, and each sensor provides distinct capabilities as well as characteristics that make it possible for an in-depth assessment of urban land use. In this context, this research aims to understand the optical data for urban land use mapping using high-resolution remote sensing satellite imagery of different periods. Traditional and machine learning techniques are used to classify urban land use patterns. The results revealed a major land use change with more built-up regions. Urban land area increased from 36.52 % (2012) to 60.23 % (2023), indicating significant urbanization. Additionally, random forest outperformed methods in comparison analysis. Moreover, the significance of this present study is that it offers insightful information into structural and spectral features of urban areas and emphasizes how precise land use classification is crucial for efficient land management, urban planning, and sustainable urban development. The study also exhibits different sources of data from different types of sensors, indicating the possible usage under any condition for emergency monitoring and immediate response.","",https://doi.org/10.1088/1755-1315/1412/1/012032,"",,
rayyan-220233444,Forest types outpaced tree species in centroid-based range shifts under global change,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Introduction Mounting evidence suggests that geographic ranges of tree species worldwide are shifting under global environmental changes. Little is known, however, about if and how these species’ range shifts may trigger the range shifts of various types of forests. Markowitz’s portfolio theory of investment and its broad application in ecology suggest that the range shift of a forest type could differ substantially from the range shifts of its constituent tree species. Methods Here, we tested this hypothesis by comparing the range shifts of forest types and the mean of their constituent species between 1970–1999 and 2000–2019 across Alaska, Canada, and the contiguous United States using continent-wide forest inventory data. We first identified forest types in each period using autoencoder neural networks and K-means cluster analysis. For each of the 43 forest types that were identified in both periods, we systematically compared historical range shifts of the forest type and the mean of its constituent tree species based on the geographic centroids of interpolated distribution maps. Results We found that forest types shifted at 86.5 km·decade -1 on average, more than three times as fast as the average of constituent tree species (28.8 km·decade -1 ). We showed that a predominantly positive covariance of the species range and the change of species relative abundance triggers this marked difference. Discussion Our findings provide an important scientific basis for adaptive forest management and conservation, which primarily depend on individual species assessment, in mitigating the impacts of rapid forest transformation under climate change.","",https://doi.org/10.3389/fevo.2024.1366568,"",,
rayyan-220233513,Deep Learning-Based Automatic Estimation of Live Coral Cover from Underwater Video for Coral Reef Health Monitoring,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Coral reefs are vital to marine biodiversity but are increasingly threatened by global climate change and human activities, leading to significant declines in live coral cover (LCC). Monitoring LCC is crucial for assessing the health of coral reef ecosystems and understanding their degradation and recovery. Traditional methods for estimating LCC, such as the manual interpretation of underwater survey videos, are labor-intensive and time-consuming, limiting their scalability for large-scale ecological monitoring. To overcome these challenges, this study introduces an innovative deep learning-based approach that utilizes semantic segmentation to automatically interpret LCC from underwater videos. That is, we enhanced PSPNet for live coral segmentation by incorporating channel and spatial attention mechanisms, along with pixel shuffle modules. Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed model achieved a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 89.51% and a mean Pixel Accuracy (mPA) of 94.47%, showcasing superior accuracy in estimating LCC compared to traditional methods. Moreover, comparisons indicated that the proposed model aligns more closely with manual interpretations than other models, with an mean absolute error of 4.17%, compared to 5.89% for the original PSPNet, 6.03% for Deeplab v3+, 7.12% for U-Net, and 6.45% for HRNet, suggesting higher precision in LCC estimation. By automating the estimation of LCC, this deep learning-based approach can greatly enhance efficiency, thereby contributing significantly to global conservation efforts by enabling more scalable and efficient monitoring and management of coral reef ecosystems.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/jmse12111980,"",,

IKN as the new capital city of Indonesia has the potential to experience changes in land cover due to massive infrastructure development in the future. Land cover detection using remote sensing and machine learning is growing rapidly because it can monitor environmental conditions in an area. Planet imagery is one of the most recent remote sensing data with sufficient spatial resolution to identify land cover. This research aims to detect vegetation objects and built-up land in the study area. The data used is Planet imagery and the research area is part of the IKN in Kalimantan, Indonesia. The method proposed in this study is the object-based classification (OBIA) Naïve Bayes compared to Nearest Neighbor method. The results show that OBIA using these two machine learnings are able to detect vegetation and built-up land where the overall accuracy with Nearest Neighbor reaches 87.8% and Naïve Bayes obtains a higher accuracy of 98.7%. This research only classifies vegetation and built-up land and in the future research can be developed to see how biodiversity conditions in the IKN area can be detected. These results indicate that the proposed method is effective for detection of built-up land cover and vegetation as a solution for environmental monitoring in IKN. By considering Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats and comparing these two methods, it is concluded that Naïve Bayes is better than Nearest Neighbor to detect vegetation in study area.","",https://doi.org/10.1088/1755-1315/1388/1/012045,"",,
rayyan-220233535,Deriving a Transformation Rate Map of Dissolved Organic Carbon over the Contiguous U.S.,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract. Riverine dissolved organic carbon (DOC) plays a vital role in regional and global carbon cycles. However, the processes of DOC conversion from soil organic carbon (SOC) and leaching into rivers are insufficiently understood, inconsistently represented, and poorly parameterized, particularly in land surface and earth system models. As a first attempt to fill this gap, we propose a generic formula that directly connects SOC concentration with DOC concentration in headwater streams, where a single parameter, the transformation rate from SOC in the soil to DOC leaching flux, Pr, accounts for the overall processes governing SOC conversion to DOC and leaching from soils (along with runoff) into headwater streams. We then derive a high-resolution Pr map over the contiguous U.S. (CONUS) in five major steps: 1) selecting 2595 headwater catchments where observed riverine DOC data are available with reasonable quality; 2) estimating catchment-average SOC for the 2595 catchments based on high-resolution SOC data; 3) estimating the Pr values for these catchments based on the generic formula and catchment-average SOC; 4) developing a predictive model of Pr with machine learning (ML) techniques and catchment-scale climate, hydrology, geology, and other attributes; and 5) deriving a national map of Pr, based on the ML model. For evaluation, we compare the DOC concentration derived using the Pr map and the observed DOC concentration values at another 3210 headwater gauges. The resulting mean absolute scaled error and coefficient of determination are 0.73 and 0.47, respectively, suggesting the effectiveness of the overall methodology. Efforts to constrain uncertainty and evaluate the sensitivity of Pr to different factors are discussed. To illustrate the use of such a map, we derive a riverine DOC concentration reanalysis dataset for more than two million small catchments over CONUS. The map, robustly derived and empirically validated, lays a critical cornerstone for better simulating the terrestrial carbon cycle in land surface and earth system models. Our findings not only set a foundation for improving our predictive understanding of the terrestrial carbon cycle at the regional and global scales but also hold promises for informing policy decisions related to decarbonization and climate change mitigation.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-2024-43,"",,

Coconut palms have a deep history in the Pacific and were planted extensively over the last two centuries to meet the surging demand for coconut oil exports. But despite wide interest in the global footprint of palm crops, the distribution of coconut palms on Pacific atolls has remained unknown. We applied a supervised machine learning classifier to satellite imagery to produce 2 m resolution vegetation maps of 235 of 266 Pacific atolls. Despite the abandonment of many plantations in recent decades, we find that coconut palms surpass native broadleaf trees in terms of canopy area: coconut presently covers 58.3% of the mapped atolls’ total forested area and 24.1% of their total land area. 51.2% of these coconut canopies occur in monocultures indicative of plantation agriculture and drastic ecological changes. Even among atolls with climates equally suitable for coconut palms, coconut canopy coverage is 32.1 percentage points greater on those that historically exported coconut products, demonstrating the significant and persistent effects of plantations on forest compositions in the tropical Pacific. Coconut palms are most dominant on large, wet islands, reflecting their high rates of water use and thus their potential to deplete critical groundwater resources. The spread of coconut plantations also came at the expense of native vegetation critical for wildlife habitat, nutrient cycling, and soil formation. The severe environmental impacts of coconut plantations urge ecosystem management in a region uniquely exposed to climate change.","",https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/ad8c66,"",,

The best results were achieved by incorporating seasonal Sentinel-1 and Landsat features alongside PALSAR data, yielding an R-square of 0.72, RMSE of 3.43 m, and bias of 2.44 m. Using seasonal data instead of summer-only data improved variability by 10%, reduced error by 0.45 m, and decreased bias by 1 m. The deep learning model's weighting strategy notably reduced errors in tall canopy height estimates compared to a recent global model, though it overestimated lower canopy heights. Uncertainty maps highlighted greater uncertainty near forest edges, where GEDI measurements are prone to errors and SAR data may encounter backscatter issues like foreshortening, layover, and shadow. This study enhances canopy height estimation techniques in areas lacking spaceborne LiDAR coverage, providing essential tools for forestry, environmental monitoring, and carbon stock estimation.","",https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2410.18108,"",,
rayyan-220233711,Urban Land Cover and Use Changes in Istanbul Remote Sensing and Hyperspectral Imaging Advances from 2000 to 2025,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"The urban land cover and use changes in Istanbul, Turkey, have been marked by rapid population growth and urbanization, particularly from 2000 to 2025. Istanbul, the largest city in Turkey, has experienced a significant surge in population, from approximately 10 million in 2000 to nearly 16 million by 2020, driving extensive urban development. This growth has led to the encroachment on green spaces and agricultural lands, exacerbating environmental challenges such as the loss of biodiversity, alteration of ecosystems, and increased vulnerability to natural hazards like earthquakes and floods. Remote sensing and GIS technologies have proven vital in monitoring these land cover changes and assessing ecological impacts. The paper explores the socio-economic implications of urbanization, including increased pressure on urban infrastructure, labor market dynamics, and land use conflicts. It highlights the need for sustainable urban planning that integrates ecological conservation, socioeconomic factors, and resilience to climate change. Future research directions emphasize the role of hyperspectral remote sensing, machine learning, and interdisciplinary collaboration in fostering more effective urban development strategies. Achieving a balance between urban growth and environmental sustainability is crucial for Istanbul’s future.","",https://doi.org/10.31219/osf.io/5hstr,"",,
rayyan-220233739,How sensor technologies combined with artificial intelligence increase the efficiency in grapevine breeding (research): current developments and future perspectives,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Viticulture and grapevine breeding programs have to face and adapt to the rapidly changing growing conditions due to the ongoing climate change, the scarcity of resources and the demand for sustainability within the whole value chain of wine production. In times of highly effective and cost-efficient genotyping technologies routinely applied in plant research and breeding, the need for comparable high-speed and high-resolution phenotyping tools has increased substantially. The disciplines of grapevine research, breeding and precision viticulture picked up this demand – mostly independent from each other – by the development, validation and establishment of different sensor technologies in order to extend management strategies or to transform labor-intensive and expensive phenotyping. Although aims, usage and expenses of applying digital tools differ, the requested outcome is similar: objective, precise and reliable data for plant evaluation with high spatial and temporal resolution. For grapevine research and breeding, fast and possibly non-destructive data acquisition is crucial in order to capture phenotypic behaviors throughout the season, e.g. plant health after heat waves (grape sunburn). Depending on the trait of interest, we established pipelines for high-throughput data acquisition under standardized lab conditions and for in-field applications by ground-based platforms. Automated data analysis is furthermore of outstanding importance to reliably extract phenotypic traits from sensor data without the need of permanent user interaction. Therefore, efficient sensors combined with AI-based data analysis are the most powerful tools we used to extract and predict complex traits like yield potential, canopy health (both using field images) or Botrytis bunch rot resilience.","",https://doi.org/10.58233/qivjoi0k,"",,
rayyan-220233754,Analysis of the Effects of Different Spectral Transformation Methods on the Estimation of Chlorophyll Content of Reclaimed Vegetation in Rare Earth Mining Areas,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Ion adsorption rare earths are an important strategic resource, but their leach mining causes post-mining wastelands and tailings to suffer from soil sanding, acidification, and heavy metal contamination. This makes natural vegetation recovery difficult, relying mainly on artificial reclamation; however, the reclaimed vegetation grows poorly due to environmental stress. Hyperspectral remote sensing technology, with its high efficiency, non-destructive nature, and wide-range monitoring capability, can accurately estimate the physiological parameters of reclaimed vegetation. This provides support for environmental regulation in mining areas. In this study, three typical types of reclaimed vegetation in the Lingbei Rare Earth Mining Area, Dingnan County, Ganzhou City, were analyzed. Hyperspectral data and the corresponding chlorophyll content were collected to compare the spectral differences between reclaimed and normal vegetation. The spectral data were processed using mathematical transformation, fractional order differentiation, discrete wavelet transform, and continuous wavelet transform. Sensitive bands were extracted, and multispectral transformed feature bands were integrated. Linear and machine learning regression models were used to estimate chlorophyll content. The effects of different spectral processing methods on chlorophyll estimation were then analyzed. The results showed that reclaimed vegetation had higher spectral reflectance than normal vegetation, with the red valley shifting towards the long-wave direction and a steeper red edge slope. Different spectral transformation methods impact the accuracy of chlorophyll content estimation. Using appropriate methods can improve estimation accuracy. Fusing multi-spectral transformation features can achieve relatively good results. Among the models, the random forest regression model provides the best performance in estimating the chlorophyll content of reclaimed vegetation. This study provides a scientific basis for rapid and accurate monitoring of reclaimed vegetation growth in rare earth mining areas, supporting environmental management and decision-making and contributing to ecological restoration.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/f16010026,"",,

While the tropical forests in the Amazon play a crucial role in the global carbon cycle and are a biodiversity hotspot, they were also shown to suffer from El-Niño related droughts in the past, leading to legitimate concerns about the ecological consequences of the recent climate conditions. To this day, the tools that we have in hand to determine those ecological consequences have lagged behind the present due to the complexity to acquire and process new remote sensing data or run land surface models. In this study, we employed advanced machine learning models trained on state-of-the-art remote sensing and dynamic global vegetation model estimates of gross primary productivity (GPP). The models provide near real-time GPP estimates, revealing significant productivity reductions during the 2023/2024 drought, unmatched in at least the past 30 years. Negative GPP anomalies were more widespread across the Amazon than during any other recent major drought event. The Climate-GPP relationships that emerged from the models suggest that future temperature increases and changes in precipitation will severely challenge Amazon forest resilience.","",https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-4161696/v1,"",,

However, it is challenging to predict these GW anomalies over the long term in agricultural areas due to complicated boundary conditions, heterogeneous hydrogeological characteristics, and groundwater extraction, as well as nonlinear interactions among these factors. To overcome this challenge, we developed an advanced modeling framework based on a recurrent neural network of long short-term memory (LSTM) as an alternative to complex and computationally expensive physical models. GW anomalies were forecast two months in advance (t + 2) based on the evaluation of drivers that influence GW dynamics in densely irrigated agricultural regions.

The modeling framework was developed for the period 1958–2020 by utilizing easily accessible dynamic and static variables to represent hydrometeorological and geological characteristics. GW anomaly observations were acquired from 26 piezometers (wells) installed in the sandy aquifer in WCS over 10–60 years. The subset of GW observations from ∼ 10–60 years, not used in model training, can forecast GW anomalies two months out with a coefficient of determination R2 ∼ 0.8.

rayyan-220233822,Ecosystem heterogeneity is key to limiting the increasing climate-driven risks to European forests,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Science for societyForest mortality due to natural disturbances such as fires, storms, and pests has increased in Europe in recent decades and is expected to increase further due to climate change. Although important forest services may soon be seriously affected, assessments of the negative effects of natural disturbances and possible solutions to minimize them are still scarce. Ecosystem heterogeneity—the diversity of tree species and sizes—has been suggested as an option to increase forest resistance, but its effectiveness remains elusive. Here, we estimate the biomass loss due to natural disturbances on European forests from 1979 to 2018 and evaluate the benefits of increasing forest heterogeneity. We used the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change method for climate risk assessment by integrating disturbance records and satellite data. Results show that enhancing the ecosystem heterogeneity could reduce biomass loss by about 18%, and such action should therefore be fostered to minimize climate-related risks to European forests.Highlights•Forest disturbances have led to a rise in biomass loss in Europe over 1979–2018•Climate change has largely determined the increasing trend in risk•The contribution of insect outbreaks is prominent compared to windthrows and fires•Enhancing ecosystem heterogeneity reduces the climate risks to European forestsSummaryThe rise in forest disturbances due to climate change poses a serious threat to key forest ecosystem services, yet impact and adaptation assessments are scarce at European scale. Here, we estimate the forest biomass loss in Europe due to fires, windthrows, and insect outbreaks over 1979–2018 and evaluate potential adaptation benefits by integrating machine learning with disturbance data and satellite products. Results show an average overall annual biomass loss of 41.6 ± 5.3 Mt at European level subject to a significant rise of 2.3 ± 0.3 Mt year−1, largely influenced by climate change (72%–98%). The contribution of insect outbreaks appears prominent (79%) compared to windthrows (20%) and fires (1%) and linked to their upsurge after the year 2000. However, impacts vary greatly across Europe depending on local environmental conditions. We estimate that enhancing ecosystem heterogeneity could reduce biomass loss by about 18%, and such action should therefore be fostered in forest adaptation policies.Graphical abstract","",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.oneear.2024.10.005,"",,
rayyan-220233842,Soil organic carbon stocks as driven by land use in Mato Grosso State: the Brazilian Cerrado agricultural frontier,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"To address national and global demand for agro-based products, agricultural expansion has rapidly become a norm in Brazil since 1950s to date. In recent decades, agricultural expansion and technological advancement have placed the country among the top producers and exporters of agricultural products. The paradigm shifts in farming system from conventional to integrated approach has brought significant changes in land use, which consequently influenced carbon sequestration and soil organic carbon (SOC). This is more prevalent in the State of Mato Grosso, one of the most producers of food in Brazil. On this background, we hypothesized that though forests have potential for SOC stock, which decreases due to conversion to cropland but in longer-term with sustainable management, carbon might accrual significantly in cropland. Therefore, this paper aimed to unveil the nexus between long term land use and carbon stock changes and estimate future SOC stocks in Mato Grosso State of Brazil. To achieve this aim, a hybridization of machine learning and the InVEST prediction models was applied to estimate the land use changes and the SOC stocks between 1990 and 2020 and estimate for 2050. The study revealed that between 1990, 2020, and 2050, croplands increased significantly by at least 78%, pastures decreased by 32%, while forests decreased marginally by about 4% due to agricultural expansions. However, in 1990 and 2020, the SOC stock was slightly up to 147.34 Mg ha−1, it recorded an increase after a longer-time (i.e., in 2050). This increase was substantially under the forests, and marginally in the croplands. Climate-smart agricultural systems such as crop-livestock forest, integrated crop-livestock, and other conservation agricultural practices have great potential to contribute to sustainable development by increasing the levels of carbon in agricultural soils especially, after a longer period. Therefore, agricultural policies geared towards low carbon agriculture should be fully integrated into the various government decision making processes as this will guarantee food security and maximize soil carbon sequestration and stocks in the long term. Simultaneously, it is crucial to promote the dissemination of best practices for implementing and sustaining conservation efforts, thereby safeguarding the carbon stocks established to prevent their depletion. This will also support the Brazilian government in achieving its Nationally determined contributions (NDCs) through agricultural soils.","",https://doi.org/10.1007/s43621-024-00592-w,"",,
rayyan-220233850,Studying the Impact of LULC Correspondence Between Landsat 8 and Spot 7 Data on Land Surface Temperature Estimation,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Information about land surface temperature (LST) plays a crucial role in environmental studies, as it provides essential data for understanding climate patterns, assessing ecosystem health, and predicting environmental changes. Understanding the relationship between land cover types and LST is crucial across all disciplines that deal with LST data. It helps researchers identify trends in global warming, heatwaves, and cooling effects, which can influence biodiversity, agriculture, and water resources. The accuracy of LST calculations heavily depends on the quality of the data used. However, most satellite thermal data used for LST estimations are in coarse spatial resolution. This study aims to explore the complex interaction between land cover types, considering factors such as proportion and neighboring effects, and LST recalculation by integrating the estimated LST from Landsat thermal band and Spot imagery classification. A machine learning model was employed to quantify the contribution of each Spot pixel to the LST estimated from TIRS data, classifying it as either heating or cooling. The Al Morjan and Al Hamra districts in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, were used as case studies. The results showed that Spot images achieved a classification accuracy of over 95%, whereas Landsat images did not exceed 77%. The average heating and cooling factors from neighboring pixels were 1.06 and 0.96, respectively. The study demonstrates the improved spatial distribution of LST, with overall temperature increases across all land cover classes.

rayyan-220233855,Can we harmonize the monitoring of plants and pollinators?,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Pollution, climate change, and shrinking habitats are driving major changes in flowering plant and pollinator populations. These include shifts in local abundance, population extirpations, range shifts, altered community composition, and reshuffled interactions. To date, evidence for these changes mostly reflect opportunistic efforts to collect occurrence data to document distributions. Coarse-scale perspectives on biodiversity change can be invaluable, especially when threats to rare habitats are widely distributed, but many changes occur slowly (decades) at such scales. Opportunistic occurrence data are therefore generally less useful for detecting short-term trends and monitoring the effectiveness of conservation policies. They are also typically biased for large-scale surveillance monitoring (Boyd et al., 2022) and rarely encompass both plants and pollinators, limiting our ability to estimate broad and fine-scale trends in populations and plant–pollinator interactions. Ecologists often prefer using plot-based methods for systematic surveys and monitoring, as these provide quantitative data on abundance and distributions. Resurveying such plots adds a time dimension, greatly enriching our understanding of how species abundances and distributions shift in response to drivers of global change. Monitoring and resurvey data remain scarce, leaving pictures of ecological conditions and change uncertain. Except for Switzerland and the UK, countries are slow to support systematic programs to monitor plants and pollinators. The 23–24 May Paris symposium on 'New solutions to monitor plants, pollinators and their interactions in a changing world' brought scientists together to assess the state of plant and pollinator monitoring schemes in Europe and to ponder how these might be improved, extended, and coordinated (https://www.college-de-france.fr/fr/agenda/colloque/nouvelles-approches-pour-le-suivi-des-plantes-des-pollinisateurs-et-de-leurs-interactions-dans-un). This group met to review existing schemes, compare the trends and indicators they produce, and outline future needs for research and policy. These needs include expanding the number of plots, species and habitats monitored, the different methods (e.g. by citizen scientists) and how frequently they are surveyed; how to identify and locate plants and insects quickly and reliably (including new technologies); how best to coordinate plant and pollinator sampling; and statistical tools to integrate heterogeneous data and infer causal relationships. Efforts to monitor plants include six schemes launched between 2001 and 2017 that range from regional to national in scope (Fig. 1), plus two international resurvey initiatives with the earliest observations in 1927. These programs share the following: (1) a plot-based design focused on vascular plants; (2) regular resurveys of these plots (at variable frequencies); (3) standardized protocols for collecting data on abundance or frequency; and (4) success in documenting systematic changes in plant abundances, diversity, and/or community composition. Many plant species show declining abundance (e.g. National Plant Monitoring Scheme (NPMS): unpublished; ReSurveyEurope: Jandt et al., 2022), but threatened plants in Northeastern Spain show high stability (Garcia et al., 2021). Population increases and declines are associated with climate change (especially 'thermophilization' – Vigie-flore: Martin et al., 2019; forestREplot: Zellweger et al., 2020), eutrophication (Biodiversity Monitoring Switzerland (BDM): Roth et al., 2013; North America: Clark et al., 2019), and biotic homogenization (BDM: Buehler & Roth, 2011). Plant–animal interactions also alter plant communities. The impacts of herbivory have long been documented; declines in animal-pollinated plants are another apparently widespread, but more recently observed, phenomenon (North America: Wiegmann & Waller, 2006; Novana: Ehlers et al., 2021; BDM: Abrahamczyk et al., 2022; Vigie-flore: unpublished). Although the symposium identified some common changes in diversity across Europe, differences also exist among countries that deserve investigation. Some of them may reflect the lack of a common monitoring system across Europe, as well as other intrinsic biases in design or implementation (e.g. nonrandom distributions of volunteers in space and over time). To supplement our symposium, we organized a survey to collect additional data on European plant monitoring schemes (https://mnhncesco.limesurvey.net/985853?lang=en). This was intended to facilitate a more complete comparison of how schemes vary in spatial, temporal, and ecological coverage and the use of volunteer vs professional staff. The resulting review should highlight conspicuous gaps in monitoring and suggest guidelines to improve existing and proposed monitoring schemes. These guidelines will likely include needs for geographical representativeness, stratification in sampling, ways to include rare species or habitats, and statistical methods to characterize change. Monitoring wild pollinators is even less frequent across most of Europe, reflecting in part their impressive diversity (2138 species of bees, 496 butterflies, 913 hoverflies, plus thousands of uncounted moths, flies, wasps, and beetles). Relatively few specialists exist for many of these groups, and entomological citizen science efforts are more difficult or impossible. Monitoring schemes exist in a few countries (e.g. the UK), but overall, we have few data on abundance except for butterflies. We thus lack trend data for most pollinators and pollination services across the EU, especially in southern and eastern Europe where basic knowledge is lacking even for well-studied groups. However, the symposium was encouraged to learn that a standardized EU pollinator monitoring scheme (EU-PoMS) is under development to overcome current knowledge gaps. The EU's new (2024) Nature Restoration Law may provide an opportunity to implement EU-PoMS. Assuming adequate plant and pollinator monitoring can be implemented, it will still be necessary to link these efforts to document shifts in plant–pollinator interactions. Coordinated joint plant–pollinator monitoring schemes would help us understand how plants affect pollinators and vice versa. In this regard, it was encouraging to learn of the 'Spipoll' program that seeks to document plant–pollinator interactions using large numbers of volunteers' photographs collected according to a standardized protocol. Spipoll data have already been used to characterize how specialized pollinators tend to avoid urban areas (Deguines et al., 2016). Additional programs designed to monitor both plant and insect populations at shared locations would further enhance our ability to detect changes in plant–pollinator interactions. The diversity of goals, methodologies, and data structures among the reviewed programs makes it clear that it will be difficult or impossible to standardize data collection procedures across countries and monitoring schemes. Instead, we might usefully seek to construct a modeling framework to extract similar key information from different data types. In particular, it may be possible to link programs using different types of data at different frequencies and spatial scales using rarefaction and latent variables to capture changes over time and space. Similar hierarchical models have been used elsewhere to extract information from different data types (NPMS: Pescott et al., 2019). For these efforts to succeed, we need to focus on a few key concepts, such as changes in abundance over time, to investigate the combined datasets. Visual analysis techniques to detect and identify species have improved significantly in recent years. They may enable us to improve monitoring programs by automating some aspects of species identification, data entry, and validation. Advancing sensor and analysis (AI) technologies have reduced costs while enhancing capabilities, allowing these technologies to be applied to smaller and more active animals (e.g. pollinators) and diverse small herbaceous species embedded within other vegetation. Photographic traps could be used to detect and monitor insects at flowers and quantify interactions. So far, efforts to identify plant species have mainly used close-up images of flowers and/or leaves. Newer efforts use massive visual learning data derived from citizen science platforms such as iNaturalist (https://www.inaturalist.org) or Pl@ntNet to continually improve accuracy and reliability (Joly et al., 2016). New deep-learning models (e.g. vision transformers) allow new types of analysis (Elvekjaer et al., 2024). Field workers may soon take high-resolution quadrat images (Fig. 2) for subsequent analysis by self-supervised learning models to generate data on species frequency and cover. Eventually, autonomous drones or ground vehicles equipped with cameras might lower costs enough to allow regular systematic monitoring of large areas, greatly enhancing our ability to monitor ecological change. However, care must be taken to keep botanists and citizens in the field, to maintain their knowledge and connection with nature, as well as to collect reference data that are necessary to validate new technologies. Structured monitoring schemes, especially when linked together, can generate sensitive indicators to detect changes in abundance and early-warning signals of impending extirpations. When these efforts are consistent, extensive, and extended over time, they also provide opportunities to test which environmental factors most likely drive these changes (e.g. by using 'natural experiments' that exploit spatial variation in environmental conditions). Consistent and continued monitoring programs are also essential to assess whether public policies and programs are meeting their goals. The EU's new Nature Restoration Law aims to restore at least 20% of the EU's land and sea areas by 2030 and all ecosystems needing restoration by 2050. Harmonized plant monitoring initiatives across Europe along the lines of EU-PoMS would provide a key tool for assessing its success. Coordinating these programs at the international scale will facilitate comparisons among temperate regions, increasing our ability to describe changes and infer causes. It would also serve as a useful model for monitoring ecological change in other biogeographical regions, including the tropics.

In Meherpur District, Bangladesh, limited research has integrated LULC mapping with predictive models, resulting in a gap in knowledge regarding future land use patterns in this fast-changing region. This study addresses that gap by analyzing LULC changes from 2000 to 2024 using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Geographic Information Systems (GIS), and the Cellular Automata (CA) model for predictive analysis. The study reveals significant LULC changes over the 24-year period, including an 18% decrease in vegetation cover, a 6% reduction in agricultural land, and a 4% increase in built-up areas. These trends align with global patterns of urban expansion, often at the expense of agricultural and natural land. Additionally, increases in fallow land (7%) and water bodies (8%) indicate changing land use driven by population growth and infrastructure development. The loss of vegetation, in particular, poses risks to biodiversity, climate regulation, and food security. An innovative aspect of this research is the use of the CA model with the MOLUSCE plugin in QGIS, enabling simulations of future LULC changes up to 2032. This predictive approach offers insights into the impacts of ongoing urbanization, unlike previous studies in Bangladesh that mainly focused on historical LULC changes. The study suggests several future research directions, including investigating the socio-economic drivers of LULC changes, expanding the geographic scope to neighboring regions, and incorporating advanced remote sensing and machine learning techniques to enhance the accuracy of predictions. In conclusion, this research fills a critical gap in LULC studies in Meherpur by combining historical analysis with predictive modeling, offering valuable insights for policymakers to guide sustainable land use planning amidst ongoing urbanization and agricultural development.","",https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-5275701/v1,"",,
rayyan-220233937,Climate challenges: can plants adapt in time?,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"The Earth's climate has continuously fluctuated throughout its recent history, with many of the most significant changes linked to changing levels of atmospheric CO2 and other greenhouse gases such as N2O and CH4 during cycles of glacial and interglacial periods (roughly every 100 thousand years since the Mid-Pleistocene). However, the current rise in CO2 is mainly due to human activities and is unprecedented in both its speed and concentration, now exceeding 400 ppm which is well above the ~ 300 ppm seen in the interglacial periods before anthropogenic pollution. This rapid increase in CO2 levels is far beyond what organisms have experienced over the last million years and poses serious challenges to their existence and functioning.While plants thrive under rising CO2 levels (Ainsworth and Long 2021), rapid and continuous warming consequent to greenhouse gases accumulation could push the Earth into a ""hothouse"" state (Steffen et al. 2018). Rising temperatures, along with concurrent stresses such as prolonged or recurrent droughts and soil salinization, threaten global agricultural productivity, and food security.Organism enduring permanent or recurrent stresses associated with climate change may: a) adapt to the stress; b) migrate to areas more suitable for growth and reproduction, or, in absence of any of these two responses, c) undergo extinction.Plants are sessile organisms. They can migrate through trans-generation seed dispersal, but this process is very slow, limited, and inefficient. Despite observed migration of plant communities in response to warming climates many plants have limited options for migration. Moreover, only migration at speeds greater than one km per year would allow plants to successfully escape the impacts of climate change, as suggested by Corlett and Westcott (2013). The success of the plant migration strategy to cope with climate change is therefore clearly limited.Eliminato: 1 Plants possess the ability to adapt to a wide range of environmental conditions due to their phenotypic plasticity. However, the phenotypes of plants also react rather slowly to environmental pressures. Indeed, any environmental change needs to be sensed first by plants, subsequently activating transcriptional, post-transcriptional or even epigenetic regulatory mechanisms. Those responses lead to phenotypic changes associated with improved tolerance and/or resilience, or with the capacity to escape incoming stress. Is this fast enough to cope with the current pace of climate warming? Previous studies cast doubts on this capacity (Loarie et al. 2009;Ostra et al. 2018). Indeed, a fundamental assumption of paleoecology has been that the rate of evolution is far slower than the rate of current climate change and the faster it occurs, the more extreme phenotypes in populations will likely be lost (Davis et al. 2005) (Figure 1).Additionally, farming might have eroded the capacity for high phenotypic plasticity of agricultural (domesticated) plants. For example, breeding exclusively for high productivity selects for traits that enhance crop yields (e.g. shorter stems, increased fruit and seed size or production). At the same time, it selects against other traits that positively influence plant survival, such as the synthesis of secondary metabolites, including phenolics, which reduce growth and/or produce antinutrients). As a result, plants loose crucial adaptation strategies, leaving them more vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, and to the loss of biodiversity.To allow plants to effectively and timely adapt to climate change may require a ""help"" from our side. In their Frontiers in Science lead article, Palmgren and Shabala (2024) discuss current knowledge about the possibility of reintroducing lost traits from wild relatives of cultivated plants (re-wilding) or, alternatively, of de novo domestication of wild plants.However, adaptation to abiotic stresses by re-wilding plants probably requires re-introduction Eliminato: plants' capacity to keep pace with current 62 changes of a suite of genes, as tolerance to abiotic stresses is a complex trait, entailing activation of multiple metabolic pathways. This is unlikely to result in the fast help that is required. In fact, taking on board the case of plant adaptation to salinity as highlighted in Palmgren and Shabala (2024), and despite considerable progress in understanding plant responses to salt stress, breeding of salt-tolerant cultivars has progressed slowly. Even when salt-tolerance genes have been identified, we have not yet been able to produce commercially relevant salttolerant varieties (Hu and Schmidhalter 2023).Driving accelerated domestication could present a more promising and practical technology for developing plants that can adapt better to climate change. Today, around thirty domesticated species account for a significant portion of dietary diversity, with only three principal cereal grains (rice, wheat, and maize) contributing to more than half of the calories intake worldwide (FAO, 2010). Thousands of edible species have been left out in the course of plant domestication; yet these underutilized species might hold the potential to transform our food systems toward being more nutritious, sustainable, and resilient to climate change (Ray et al. 2020).There are numerous suitable candidates for domestication among wild relative species, especially when stress-related tolerance has already successfully evolved in nature (e.g. in halophytes). However, domestication today often requires conversion of wild plant species into crops not only viable but also producing high yields (Rozema and Flowers 2008). It is unclear whether this goal will be successfully met as any step toward setting final yields (e.g. successful seed germination or propagation, resistance to plant diseases, positive response to farming practices such as harvesting) needs to be tested, and this, if achievable, may require time. Even when domestication of wild relatives can be successfully carried out, will the new crops meet farmers' and consumers' expectations? Tolerance of abiotic stressors often leads High-throughput phenotyping, in particular, has previously been a bottleneck, slowing the selection of suitable plant material for breeding and monitoring resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses. However, significant progress has been made in plant phenotyping by taking advantage of new technologies that merge new sensors availability (especially optical sensors) with robotics and artificial intelligence applications (Watt et al. 2019). Today, plant phenotyping is the main tool scientists use to non-destructively characterize plantenvironment interactions over the plant's lifetime, and breeders use it for high-throughput selection of desirable genotypes for specific traits. However, the massive volume of plant phenotyping data needs harmonization and powerful statistical tools to be useful in the rapid selection of adapted plants.There are other biotechnological tools helping with increasing plants' capacity to adapt to fast changing environments. For example, genomic selection promises to overcome problems experienced when applying marker-assisted selection to select for quantitative traits controlled by multiple genes, such as those involved in climate change adaptation (Budhlakoti et al. 2022). Other technologies, such as directed evolution, may speed up retrieval and insertion of resistance traits, with microbial assistance (Gionfriddo et al. 2019).Significant progress might come from improved knowledge of plant interaction with soil and airborne microorganisms. This emerging field benefits from great advances in microbial genomics, plant-microbe interactions, and the resulting changes in plant physiology and phenotypes. These developments hold great potential for enhancing plant adaptation to changing environments.As a final point, it is important to note that developing crops without accounting for their need to cope with environmental stresses may not be the most effective strategy for future agriculture. While farming practices strive to provide conditions that minimize stress to maximize growth and yield, climate change is expected to exacerbate environmental stresses and crop yield losses, and resources such as water and fertilizers are increasingly limiting plant production (Rezaei et al. 2023). Moreover, farming marginal lands has important economic, environmental, and social consequences, e.g. fighting desertification and migrations of environmental refugees. Finally, secondary metabolites that plants need to selfdefend against stresses, such as many antioxidants and pigments, have positive nutritional properties (Gionfriddo et al. 2019). Thus, breeding plants that successfully cope with stresses can also make our food safer and healthier. The figure, adapted from Davis et. al. (2005) shows changes in phenotypic means and optimal fitness means of populations of a plant species along a climate gradient under (A) a stable climate, (B) a changing climate, and (C) a rapidly changing climate. While optimal conditions follow the shift in the climate gradient, mean phenotypes are unable to follow; the more rapid the shift in climate change is, the more individual of a population will be under a condition favoring their extinction.Note from the Editorial office: publishing this figure will depend on reproduction permission from Davis et al.'s original publisher.","",https://doi.org/10.3389/fsci.2024.1522649,"",,
rayyan-220233938,"Wildlife detection, counting and survey using satellite imagery: are we there yet?",,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Wildlife surveys are key to assessing the health of global biodiversity. Traditional field and aerial methods however have significant limitations, including high costs, substantial time investment, and potentially biased estimates. The increasing availability of high-throughput monitoring sensors in recent years has opened new perspectives for wildlife studies. Very-high-resolution (VHR) satellite sensors promise large spatial and temporal coverage while seemingly being less costly than traditional methods. Deep learning (DL) has shown increasingly impressive capabilities for processing remote sensing imagery, suggesting good prospects for imagery-based wildlife surveys. We reviewed all taxa and geographic area studies that use satellite imagery for wildlife detection, counting and surveys. Through an analysis of 49 peer-reviewed papers, this study examined the sensors and resolutions employed along with the methods used to detect, count and survey wildlife in various biomes. Results have revealed an increasing trend of publications. Mammals and birds are the focus of most of the papers, mainly in polar/alpine and pelagic ocean waters biomes. Visual interpretation is the most common method used for wildlife detection and counting while total count is mostly used for surveying. Most of the papers present a proof of concept to detect, count and survey wildlife. Technological advances are expected to enhance the spatial and temporal resolutions of satellite imagery, as well as image processing capabilities. Three main bottlenecks preventing the development of on-demand operational approaches for wildlife surveys were identified: 1) the business model of VHR satellite imagery providers is not conducive to wildlife studies; 2) satellite imagery is rarely shared; and 3) the training of multidisciplinary highly qualified personnel is underdeveloped. In response, this review presents key research priorities for advancing remote sensing for wildlife monitoring. They include wildlife-dedicated satellite constellations at enhanced spatial and temporal resolutions, increased data accessibility and sharing, adapted survey strategy, development of foundational DL model and multidisciplinary integration. We believe that progress in these directions will foster new survey strategies that are certain to revolutionize wildlife monitoring in the decades to come.","",https://doi.org/10.1080/15481603.2024.2348863,"",,
rayyan-220233958,Cartographie de l’habitat de reproduction du tétras-lyre (Lyrurus tetrix) dans les Alpes françaises,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"The Black Grouse (Lyrurus tetrix) is an emblematic alpine species with high conservation importance. The population size of these mountain bird tends to decline on the reference sites and shows differences according to changes in local landscape characteristics. Habitat changes are at the centre of the identified pressures impacting part or all of its life cycle, according to experts. Hence, an approach to monitor population dynamics, is trough modelling the favourable habitats of Black Grouse breeding (nesting sites). Then, coupling modelling with multi-source remote sensing data (medium and very high spatial resolution), allowed the implementation of a spatial distribution model of the species. Indeed, the extraction of variables from remote sensing helped to describe the area studied at appropriate spatial and temporal scales: horizontal and vertical structure (heterogeneity), functioning (vegetation indices), phenology (seasonal or inter-annual dynamics) and biodiversity. An annual time series of radiometric indices (NDVI, NDWI, BI {\ldots}) from Sentinel-2 has made it possible to generate Dynamic Habitat Indices (DHIs) to derive phenological indications on the nature and dynamics of natural habitats. In addition, very high resolution images (SPOT6) provided access to the fine structure of natural habitats, i.e. the vertical and horizontal organisation by states identified as elementary (mineral, herbaceous, low and high woody). Indeed, one of the essential limiting factors for brood rearing is the presence of a well-developed herbaceous or ericaceous stratum in the northern Alps and larch forests in the southern region. A deep learning model was used to classify elementary strata. Finally, Biomod2 R platform, using an ensemble approach, was applied to model, the favourable habitat of Black Grouse reproduction. Of all the models, Random Forest and Extreme Boosted Gradient are the best performing, with TSS and ROC scores close to 1. For the SDM, we selected only Random Forest models (ensemble modelling) because of their low susceptibility to overfitting and coherent predictions (after comparing model predictions).In this ensemble model, the most important explanatory variables are altitude, the proportion of heathland, and the DHI (NDVI Max and NDWI Max). Results from the habitat model can be used as an operational tool for monitoring forest landscape shifts and changes. In addition, to delimiting potential areas to protect the species habitat, which constitute a valuable decision-making tool for conservation management of mountain open forest.","",,"",,
rayyan-220233999,Disease ecology and pathogeography: Changing the focus to better interpret and anticipate complex environment–host–pathogen interactions,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Over the past 15 years, disease ecology has become a discipline in its own right. It is fundamentally based on training in ecology and evolution, with solid theoretical foundations and skills in computational biology and statistics, and it differs from a medical approach to the interpretation of disease. It is concerned with how species interactions, including host–pathogen relationships and environmental conditions (e.g. temperature and rainfall), affect patterns and processes of disease presence and spread, how pathogens impact host individuals, populations, communities, and ultimately ecosystem function (Ostfeld et al. 2008). Initially rooted in parasite ecology, particularly among researchers working on transmission cycles and host–disease population dynamics, disease ecology mainly focuses on parasitic and infectious diseases but is not exclusive to them (Ostfeld 2018). A booming subfield currently concerns research linking different areas such as infectious transmission, agriculture development, and development aid policies, notably in the world's poorest countries (Ngonghala et al. 2014). Unlike ecologists, disease ecologists focus on understanding the causes and consequences of the maintenance and transmission of pathogens in animal species, including humans, plants, and communities of species. It has become much more widespread in studies among wild animal species, also in their contacts with domestic species, e.g. livestock, and their interactions with human populations, and much less so in plant diseases and their transmission, which in some respects are the focus of more plant-pathology molecular-orientated research (Guégan et al. 2023a). We cannot say that the development of disease ecology has involved the gradual integration of several distinct lines of inquiry because it is the heir of ecology. It has an ecosystem-based approach and takes into account natural complexity (Johnson et al. 2015, Hassell et al. 2021, Petrone et al. 2023); it develops experimental methods in the laboratory or mesocosms and has an essential background in statistical and mathematical analysis. The spatial scales of disease ecology study are experimental or local and, depending on the questions posed, can extend to the most global scales (Guernier et al. 2004, Jones et al. 2008, Allen et al. 2017, Carlson et al. 2022). In the temporal domain, these can be daily or weekly studies or multi-decadal investigations, such as in disease population dynamics (Keeling and Rohani 2007). By definition, disease ecology is concerned with understanding patterns and processes on large spatial and temporal scales. It integrates different levels of life organization, i.e. from genes to the global ecosystem, which is not the case, or only to a limited extent, of medical and veterinary approaches (Ezenwa et al. 2015). Over the years, however, disease ecology has gained the confidence of other disciplines, particularly the medical and veterinary ones, and is now published in top-leading generalist journals (Mahon et al. 2024, Pfenning-Butterworth et al. 2024, Chevillon et al. 2024). Today, disease ecology is also challenging established dogmas in human and veterinary medicine, reconsidering several aspects of infectious transmission in-depth, raising the question of possible larger host species spectra, and questioning the origin and nature of pathogen virulence (Chevillon et al. 2024). We are happy to present this special issue on disease ecology in the journal Ecography. At least two other contributions recently published in Ecography could have contributed to this special issue in disease ecology. Both constitute remarkable illustrations of macro-scale studies on host–parasite interactions. They are: Latitudinal distributions of the species richness, phylogenetic diversity and functional diversity of fleas and their small mammalian hosts in four geographic quadrants by Krasnov and colleagues (Krasnov et al. 2023); and Continental-scale climatic gradients of pathogenic microbial taxa in birds and bats by Xu and coauthors (Xu et al. 2023). As illustrated in the different sections of this special issue, disease ecology is a highly interdisciplinary field, drawing on molecular biology and population genetics, immunology, epidemiology, time-series and spatial biostatistics, and ecological and epidemiological modeling. It takes an interdisciplinary approach, often questioning disease distribution, transmission, and intensity from another angle, and this with the wish to propose methods of surveillance, control, and research that are innovative sometimes breakthrough, and more in line with the complexity of the observations made. In summary, the papers we present in this issue illustrate diverse scientific work and confirm the significant growth of disease ecology in the international research landscape. Climate change is accepted as an important driver of infectious disease emergence and spread for humans, wildlife, and domestic animals (Mora et al. 2022). However, there is considerable controversy as to whether climate change operates directly on the ecology of host–pathogen interactions (Franklinos et al. 2019, Casadevall 2020) or whether it intervenes more indirectly by exacerbating prevailing environmental, socioeconomic, or political conditions (Guégan et al. 2023b). In a disease–biogeography study based on field observations, entitled Climate change linked to vampire bat expansion and rabies virus spillover, Van de Vuurst and collaborators (Van de Vuurst et al. 2023) report the impacts of global warming on the distributional range and expansion of the common vampire bat, Desmodus rotundus, across the Americas over the last century. Through a cogent correlation-based statistical analysis, the authors document the gradual expansion of vampire-borne rabies virus outbreaks in cattle herds in the last 50 years of the multi-decadal study period. The results presented here confirm the numerous observations of vampire-borne rabies cases in livestock on the continent while situating it in a macroecological dimension and pathogeography research perspective (Murray et al. 2018). Then, Garcia-Carrasco and coauthors in an article, Present and future situation of West Nile virus in the Afro-Palaearctic pathogeographic system (Garcia-Carrasco et al. 2024), analyze the impacts of climate change on West Nile virus transmission and spread, a disease system that is highly sensitive to weather conditions and change. This virus is transmitted by insect vectors, genus Culex, and is also hosted by a wide range of bird species, making this zoonotic disease highly sensitive to climatic conditions. Using an innovative machine learning and fuzzy logic approach to model the effects of climate change scenarios for 2040 and 2070, this study evaluates the risk of West Nile virus outbreaks in two biogeographic regions, the Afrotropical and the Western Paleartic. They report that the Afro-Paleartic land masses could experience significant upsurges of epizootic and epidemic West Nile virus, with central and northern European regions at notable risk of disease expansion beyond the current distribution range. This study also confirms a broader comparative study on spillover risk in the context of climate change and wild species range shifts (Carlson et al. 2022). Next, Aliaga Samanez and colleagues, in their article Climate change is aggravating dengue and yellow fever transmission risk (Aliaga-Samanez et al. 2024), model dengue and yellow fever diseases, two severe human infectious diseases, considering for the first time urban and sylvatic vectors, and non-primate hosts, to identify areas where climatic favourability for the two viral agents could change with global warming. Both viruses spilled over into human transmission and were translocated in many regions, opening a path for spillback onto sylvatic cycles mainly for yellow fever (Santos de Abreu et al. 2022, Tuells et al. 2022) and DENV-2 serotype (Hanley et al. 2024). Using the same methodological framework as for previous studies, they obtain projections of future transmission risk for dengue and yellow fever and show that global favourability could increase by 10% for dengue and 7% for yellow fever, providing details of regions and subregions at particular risk for each disease. Furthermore, pathogeographical patterns of viral transmission are discussed in light of both vector and non-human primates' geographical distribution and potential range shifts. Projections of disease spread scenarios within the current context of climate change become particularly relevant since these changes disrupt ecological equilibria among vectors, host reservoirs, and human populations. These three examples illustrate the application of disease ecology and biogeography tools to assess the risk of infectious diseases and anticipate their future spread. Human activities modify, either directly or indirectly, the environments in which host–pathogen interactions take place (Lindahl and Grace 2015), leading to more encounters with reservoirs (Rhyan and Spraker 2010) or changes in the natural dynamics of complex multi-species systems (Hassell et al. 2017). In this section, contributors to the Special Issue investigate how habitat alterations and loss can reshape the risk of disease transmission or emergence. Among the drivers that disease emergence and biodiversity loss share, land use features prominently. In their contribution, García-Peña and Rubio (2024) investigate how reservoirs of pathogenic and non-pathogenic New World Hantaviruses (NWH) respond to disturbances alongside a continent-wide gradient going from primary forest to agriculture. Through multivariate analysis, their results suggest that the prevalence of hosts is increased in rangelands and agricultural landscapes, corroborating global comparative studies exploring drivers of spillover transmission from rodent hosts (Ecke et al. 2022). Increased chances of encountering NWH reservoirs in agricultural lands suggest that ongoing widespread reconversion of the forest into cropland, such as the Brazilian Amazon (Morton et al. 2006), may increase the burden of infectious disease. Remarkably, this analysis also highlights a potential hotspot for reservoirs of NWH in northern Canada, a prediction that is well-supported in, for example, the case records of infections of humans by Sin Nombre virus since 1993 (Warner et al. 2020). The question of how much habitat degradation will reshape the global risk of zoonotic diseases is, likewise, the core of the contribution by (Heckley et al. 2023). Through a meta-analysis of neotropical bat prevalence and seroprevalence, they examine the consequences of various classes of habitat degradation (including forest loss) on infection dynamics. Although sampling biases led to an over-representation of data on D. rotundus and rabies virus (see also Van de Vuurst et al. 2023 in this issue), they report that the highest prevalences (above 50%) were only observed in regions with the greatest extents of forest loss in the year before sampling. Identifying these potential causal mechanisms linking habitat degradation to zoonotic disease spillover is critical for more accurate prediction (Plowright et al. 2017, Mahon et al. 2024). The strength of the study by Heckley et al. (2023) is to show how diffuse these effects can be, even within relatively well-described systems (bats in the Neotropics). One possible explanation is that seasonal dynamics (Kessler et al. 2018) can profoundly change the landscape hosts experience, and these intra-annual variations can only be captured with a significantly larger amount of data. In their contribution, Teitelbaum et al. (2024) look at how wild waterfowl interact with domestic poultry farms and how variations in these interactions shape the risk of transmission of avian influenza. The data used in this study (GPS data at the individual scale for over 400 individuals of ten species) offer a high-resolution view of space, time, and taxonomy; this allows for developing an appreciation of the risk of avian influenza transmission at a very fine scale. Different species of wild waterfowl used the habitats provided by domestic poultry farms at different rates, both across day/night and seasonal changes. Coupled with changes in abundance and influenza prevalence, the (multiplicative) interactions between these factors led to substantial changes in transmission risk, even within the relatively homogeneous study environment of California's Central Valley. These studies highlight the challenges of understanding how habitat alteration will reshape the risk associated with disease. Because the ecological processes linking species (and species interactions) to their habitats play out over heterogeneous space and time, the amount of data required to draw general conclusions remains the main obstacle. Advances in Earth Observation through, e.g. remote sensing or the increased availability of high-resolution data with GPS collars are likely to provide good data to generalize our understanding of these questions in the coming years. In this section, the authors illustrate the inherent complexity in host–pathogen or host–symbiont interactions. Indeed, a microbe cannot cause disease on its own without a host (Casadevall and Pirofski 2014). Still, this host–pathogen interaction is also mediated by the relationships it may maintain with other host and non-host species and with abiotic and biotic environmental conditions. Disease is one of several possible outcomes of an interaction between a host and a microbe, and this section also proposes research on host–symbiont relationships. A first contribution by Clark and contributors entitled Aggregation of symbionts on hosts depends on interaction type and host traits analyzes aggregation patterns in both barnacle–limpet and gill helminth–poecilid fish associations (Clark et al. 2023). The aggregation of symbionts and parasites among hosts is a near-universal pattern, and it also has important consequences for the stability of host–parasite associations and disease impacts (Morrill et al. 2022). Identifying which potential drivers are contributing to levels of observed aggregation in these systems has always been a pillar of parasitological ecology, the precursor of what would become disease ecology. This research has also contributed to developing high-performance biostatistical methods, another feature of disease ecology (McVinish and Lester 2020, Lester and Blomberg 2021). Using null models to analyze aggregation patterns in the two systems, Clark et al. (2023) show that aggregation of barnacles on limpets mirrors random partitioning, with variation observed across sites depending on limpet body size. Differently, helminth worms across fish populations were less aggregated than expected by chance, with aggregation decreasing with host fish size. The authors conclude that stochastic processes can account for the aggregation of symbionts on their hosts but do not explain the levels of aggregation observed in host–parasite interactions for which host traits may help to explain aggregation observations. In a second macroecological study, Pinheiro and colleagues describe a latitudinal specialization gradient for a set of bird-malarial parasite networks that do not conform to the rule of accepted higher specialized interactions towards the equator (Pinheiro et al. 2023). Using bird species communities within different biomes on a gradient of temperate to tropical biomes across South America, they show that while specialization of host-parasite pairs interactions, i.e. network connectedness, increases towards lower latitude, quantitative specialization, i.e. including frequencies of host–parasite interactions and host phylogenetic relatedness, on the opposite, decreases. Overall, this study indicates that, near the equator, despite the fact that each malarial lineage parasitizes a more restricted range of available bird species, infections are more evenly distributed among tropical bird species than in temperate regions. In addition to providing strong arguments against a critical ecological hypothesis about species specialization, this work also echoes recent explanations concerning zoonotic viral infections in Southern America (Thoisy et al. 2024). It also contributes to a tradition in disease ecology of conducting comparative studies of non-human systems to better understand human host–pathogen interactions. In essence, ecology is about understanding complex systems and their dynamics, and disease ecology integrates host–pathogen interactions to understand their origin, balance, and imbalance in host–pathogen equilibria and infectious transmission processes, including to humans. Sundaram and collaborators' contribution to this issue examines the origin of Ebola virus in sub-Saharan Africa, adopting an ecosystem-based approach (Sundaram et al. 2024). Instead of exclusively targeting Ebola virus linked to frugivorous bats, suspected to be the active reservoir hosts, this study investigates the role that multiple factors from bats, primates, fruiting tree species, their spatial habitat suitability, and biometeorological parameters play in driving Ebola virus disease outbreaks. Using sophisticated phylogenetically-based path analyses and comparing different plausible path scenarios, it concludes that the factors most associated with previous Ebola virus outbreaks are spatial habitat suitability for Ficus trees and the diversity of Cercopithecus monkeys in the area. Furthermore, frugivorous species guilds, including bats, primates, and several other mammals, plus Pteropodid bat species richness, are good indicators of local Ebola virus circulation but do not explain zoonotic risk. Recent studies (Pleydell et al. 2024) have highlighted the importance of understanding the phenology of various species and the disturbances natural ecosystems and their biodiversity face. This goes beyond simply observing what is readily visible, as the current research demonstrates. In a third investigation, Wallén and colleagues propose a research work entitled Consequences of repeated sarcoptic mange outbreaks in an endangered mammal population (Wallén et al. 2024). Parasites and infections are major factors influencing the population dynamics of wild animals (Hudson et al. 2002, Keesing et al. 2010). The Scandinavian arctic fox, Vulpes lagopus, is and endangered species showing a fragmented spatial distribution and suffering from inter-species competition, prey scarcity, genetic inbreeding and disease pathogens. Wallén et al. (2024) show that sarcoptic mange, caused by Sarcoptes scabiei, is responsible for repeated outbreaks in the artic fox metapopulation, and introduced by a few red fox specimens. Sarcoptic mange effects are severe and affect arctic fox demography and reproductive output. This case study also demonstrates that implementation of non-invasive treatment against V. scabiei can be effective, but only in the short-term, for spatially complex systems with overlapping species (e.g., see Haydon et al. 2006 for another illustration). In the last part of this section, Hjermann and colleagues propose a study entitled Individual and temporal variation in movement patterns of wild alpine reindeer and implications for disease management (Hjermann et al. 2024), in which they analyze animal movement patterns based on GPS-marked wild reindeer individuals to identify chronic wasting disease transmission and potential behaviour risk. Research on wild animal movements and their health situation is scarce (Calenge et al. 2024), and this work attempts to re-establish the situation. Using an extensive individual-based dataset of surveyed Norwegian alpine reindeer with individuals infected by a fatal prion causing chronic wasting diseases, this work shows that the rut season favors an increase in male home ranges, greater home range overlaps and shorter geographic distance between males, and between males and females. These conditions facilitate individual-to-individual transmission of the prion agent, and management measures to prevent excessively high transmission rates affecting livestock survival are suggested. One of the aims of this study is to propose adequate surveillance systems of wildlife to assess disease risk in the most affected regions and reconcile surveillance in the research agenda (Guégan 2024). The final section of this special issue deals with plant–pathogen interactions in space. Tree pests are a global threat to plant biodiversity (Freer-Smith and Webber 2017) and can have cascading effects on a broad range of ecosystem services (Boyd et al. 2013). As plant health is a core factor in maintaining food security (Flood 2010) and human health more broadly (Hulme 2020), these articles highlight how relevant plant–pathogen interactions are to the conversation about disease biogeography. In their contribution Climatic variability, spatial heterogeneity and the presence of multiple hosts drive the population structure of the pathogen Phytophthora ramorum and the epidemiology of Sudden Oak Death, Kozanitas et al. (2024) investigate how Sudden Oak Death epidemiology changes under the joint effects of climate variation, habitat heterogeneity, and host species turnover. Primarily affecting species from the Quercus genus, the pathogen is transmitted through a mostly unaffected host, the California Bay laurel. This causes an interesting challenge for the distribution of the pathogen, as the range of predictors required involves abiotic factors (here, precipitation is particularly determinant) and biotic ones (the distribution of the transmissive host). This situation is not specific to plants and resembles similar systems like the Cryptococcus complex, where the risk of transmission is shaped by climatic variables and the tree composition (Mak et al. 2010, 2015). Caballol et al. (2024) cover much of the same conceptual ground in their manuscript entitled Climate, host ontogeny and pathogen structural specificity determine forest disease distribution at a regional scale, but consider how different pathogen species (Dothistroma pini and Diplodia sapinea) jointly interact with their host (Pinus nigra) and the climate. Although both diseases cause additive effects (on tree defoliation), they report no evidence of competition in adult trees. Environmental heterogeneity manifested itself by changing which pathogen had the largest impact on tree mortality; Dothistroma resulted in more seedling mortality in cold and moist areas, and Diplodia in dry, warm areas. In addition to their different environmental responses, these two pathogens are likely to differ in the micro-habitat they use within the host at the adult and seedling stages. The combination of these factors resulted in a marked variation in the drivers of forest health within the study region: the host–pathogen interaction was regulated by local bioclimatic conditions, even though both pathogens were widely distributed. This is an intriguing observation, as it highlights the need to consider how coinfection may be mediated (and its outcome determined) by environmental conditions. In the final manuscript of this special issue, Contrasting effects of beekeeping and land use on plant–pollinator networks and pathogen prevalence in Mediterranean semiarid ecosystems, Martínez-López et al. (2023) study the interactive effects between beekeeping and land use on the biotic interactions between plants and pollinators, in the context of the emergence of a novel insect pathogen, Vairimorpha ceranae. V. ceranae can be transmitted during pollination (Zbrozek et al. 2023) and may lead to secondary infections by the bacterial genus Serratia (Braglia et al. 2024). In the semiarid ecosystems studied, the authors report that the prevalence of the pathogen is not predictive of its spread but varies considerably within the year. Although communities with more diverse pollination interactions and more plants tended to show a lower prevalence, this effect was only weakly significant. Yet, this is an interesting observation that should lead to future investigations of how the structure of interactions within communities can shape the potential for dilution effects. A striking takeaway from this article is that several causal relationships may only become apparent once temporal delay is considered; this emphasizes the need for temporal data collection that would re-survey several sites/communities to capture these complex temporal interactions. The interdisciplinary field of disease ecology has significantly evolved over the past 15 years, establishing itself as a distinct discipline within ecology and evolution. This special issue of Ecography underscores the importance of understanding the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of diseases, emphasizing the intricate interactions between hosts, pathogens, and their environments. The studies presented herein reflect the diverse and growing body of research that characterizes modern disease ecology, spanning topics such as climate change, habitat alteration, and the complex interplay of ecological and disease processes. The insights from this special issue suggest several areas warranting further exploration. Future research in disease ecology should prioritize integrating advanced climate models with data on ecological interactions to predict disease dynamics under changing environmental conditions. Such studies are likely to benefit from longitudinal studies tracking disease patterns over time, which are essential for identifying trends and informing management practices. Embracing interdisciplinary research that combines molecular biology, genetics, epidemiology, and ecological modeling will enhance our understanding of disease processes. Such an approach will foster innovative solutions for disease surveillance and control and for maintaining environmental health, for instance, by advancing our understanding of biodiversity's role in disease resilience. Interdisciplinary thinking applied to research on the human–wildlife interface (social science, ecology, and epidemiology) will be critical for mitigating spillover transmission risks to humans as human activities increasingly impact natural habitats. Health geography and, a fortiori biogeography and pathogeography of infectious disease, have suffered a significant loss of importance over the last 30 years in human and veterinary medicine. It is very common in the medical world to speak of ecological studies to describe the finding of spurious correlations, which in medicine are not convincing compared with the gold standard of cohort analysis studies. At the heart of this discrepancy lies the subject of changes in spatial and temporal scales, and scale-dependency, which are major concerns for science in general. Several investigations have been developed to estimate biologically relevant spatial and temporal scales at which environmental conditions impact ecological patterns and processes in ecology (Pease 2024), but this is less common in disease ecology (Becker et al. 2019; but see Halliday et al. 2020, Liu et al. 2022). Temporal and/or spatial varying scales of effect are plausible in host–disease interactions, but they remain largely untested in both theoretical and empirical studies. The debate around the dilution effect is illustrative of this. Disease–biodiversity relationships reveal contrary relationships depending on different parameters, like disease transmission categories, land types or spatial scales. Temporal and/or spatial variation in scales of effect can strongly depend on available variables at scales of interest, making that host–pathogen interactions and changes can be best explained by changes in human development at local scale because these parameters are measured and available, and explained by climatic variables and climate change at largest scale, at which these variables can be obtained, i.e. the Elton's sound hypothesis (Chavy et al. 2019 for an illustration on human leishmaniasis in southern America). This also indicates an important issue about collected data since biotic and human behaviour and attitude data exist at lower scales and quasi-absent at largest scales when abiotic parameters, e.g. meteorological data, dominate. We strongly encourage disease ecologists towards this research avenue in order to elucidate host–pathogen and also tri-trophic interactions at specific scales of effect and deciphering their ecological and evolutionary drivers. This will help disease ecology to be better understood, taught in veterinary and medicine schools, and interpreted by disciplines that are either reticent or still too hegemonic, and to play a part in the process of aiding animal and public health efforts worldwide. Disease ecology is poised for continued growth and impact in a world where change is visible at every observable scale. The advances in our field will be driven by the need to understand and take action to address the complex challenges of infectious diseases. This special issue highlights the current state of knowledge across numerous systems and scales, and sets the stage for future research to further unravel the web of interactions that define disease ecology. – This work was supported by the joint NSF-NIH-NIFA Ecology and Evolution of Infectious Disease program (DEB no. 1911457) to JFG and (NIFA no. 1211-1143-00-A, DEB no. 2308273) to BAH.

rayyan-220234008,"The 2024 “Hacking Limnology” Workshop Series and Virtual Summit: Increasing Inclusion, Participation, and Representation in the Aquatic Sciences",,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"The 4th Aquatic Ecosystem MOdeling Network—Junior (AEMON-J) Hacking Limnology Workshop and 5th Virtual Summit: Incorporating Data Science and Open Science in the Aquatic Sciences (DSOS) convened 15–19 July 2024. During the week, these joint communities engaged in activities at the intersection of big data, open science, modeling, remote sensing, and the aquatic sciences. The weeklong event, with over 100 aquatic science practitioners and enthusiasts, followed a similar structure to previous years, comprising three days of workshops followed by two days of the virtual summit (Meyer and Zwart 2020; Meyer et al. 2021b, 2022, 2023). As in previous years, accessibility for a global audience was a top priority. Both events had no registration fees, thereby enabling broad participation. All recordings and workshop materials were made freely available on the Open Science Framework (OSF) archive (Meyer et al. 2021a) (https://osf.io/682v5/) for asynchronous viewing and access following the event. Relative to the 60 countries represented annually in the 2021, 2022, and 2023 workshops and summits (Meyer et al. 2021b, 2022, 2023), the 2024 workshop and summit experienced an expansion in global representation, with the majority of registrants from newly represented countries such as Nepal and Colombia. All registrants together represented more than 70 countries. With over 600 registrants worldwide, the most represented countries included the United States (30.5% of registrants), Nigeria (10.9%), Canada (9.1%), Germany (5.8%), and Nepal (4.5%). Notably, the 2024 Workshops and Summit had the lowest proportional representation from the United States in comparison to the previous summits (Fig. 1) and was the first year with two countries in Asia being in the top 10 based on the number of registrants (Nepal and India; Table 1). With respect to career-stage, most participants identified as being in early-career positions (i.e., graduate students and post-doctoral researchers; ~50%), as in previous years (Meyer et al. 2023). This year's ""Hacking Limnology"" Workshop series featured three consecutive days of workshops. For each day, the workshop included a short, prerecorded introduction that attendees could watch prior to attending, a 45-minute keynote talk followed by a live question-and-answer session, two hours for the hands-on workshop portion, and finally one hour of breakout and working groups to discuss next steps and potential collaborations. All three workshops allowed for hands-on coding; the first and third workshops were in R (R Core Team 2024), and the second was in Python (Python Software Foundation 2024). The workshops were recorded so they could be watched asynchronously by the large number of international attendees living in different time zones. Following the workshops, all introductory materials, keynote talks, scripts, and workshop recordings were made publicly available on the OSF archive (Meyer et al. 2021a) (https://osf.io/682v5/). The focus of the first workshop was the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project (ISIMIP). ISIMIP is an international modeling initiative that quantifies climate change impacts using earth system models across different sectors and spatial scales, that is, lakes, under different climate change scenarios (Golub et al. 2022). The second workshop centered around remote sensing data from the Surface Water Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite (Biancamaria et al. 2016). The third workshop focused on Ordinary Differential Equation-based ecological modeling using the ""rodeo"" R package (Kneis et al. 2017). Each day of the workshop was well attended (up to 110 people), and engagement remained high throughout each day. Several people participated in the postworkshop breakout and working group meetings as well. Because DSOS operated independently for one year prior to joining forces with AEMON-J, the 2024 Virtual Summit marks the fifth year of DSOS Virtual Summits. As in previous years, the summit consisted of a wide range of presenters, including sessions related to big data, data-intensive models, climate change, and applications of open science. Each session consisted of three to four presenters, where each presenter prepared a 10-minute, prerecorded video of their presentation, which was streamed live during the summit. Presentations spanned a range of topics, including building crowdsourced zooplankton datasets, forecasting ecosystem function over a range of climate scenarios, creating accessible data visualizations for wide audiences, and organizing grassroots communities for expanding open science. As with previous summits, all question-and-answer sessions were live following the streaming of all presentations, where questions were submitted in a written format and presenters could access the questions in real time for better preparation. Questions and answers revolved around a suite of themes, including how to avoid ""parachute science"" (Barber et al. 2014), how to develop grassroots data harmonization efforts, and how to best work with complex spatiotemporal datasets for modeling purposes. In addition to recorded scientific presentations, the summit also hosted a career panel. This year's panel focused on career paths in industry settings, with panelists from corporations, consulting companies, and start-ups. Panelists included Kate Fickas (Esri), Arik Tashie (ClimateAI), Kateri Salk (TetraTech), Leslie Smith (Your Ocean Consulting, LLC), and Tung Nguyen (Jacobs Solutions, Inc). In their discussion, many of the panelists focused on translating science products into a portfolio that could be shared and presented to a range of industry settings. Moreover, panelists emphasized the pervasiveness of imposter syndrome, the need to recognize differences in ""experience thresholds"" across job sectors, and the importance of marketing your skills to hiring managers. As with years prior, the 2024 ""Hacking Limnology"" Workshops and Virtual Summit attracted wide attention from researchers across various career stages, experiences, and locations. Though the format was comparable to previous events, the content has expanded to more inclusively represent the researchers and themes in the nexus of data science, open science, and the aquatic sciences. The ever-popular remote sensing content has expanded from optical to radar and altimetry remote sensing. Big data conversations have expanded from -omics and high-frequency monitoring to include community composition and function databases. Numerical modeling efforts upscaled from local site studies to global climate change assessments. Discussions of career trajectories in data science and open science have arced across a spectrum from academia to government to industry settings. In short, the past 4 years of workshops and 5 year of summits have remained as dynamic as the science that they communicate, and the representation of presenters, panelists, and organizational team members has likewise expanded to showcase and connect the diversity of people engaging in this science (Tables 2 and 3). The fourth joint ""Hacking Limnology"" Workshop Series and DSOS Virtual Summit also provided an opportunity to look back on the successes and challenges of the prior half decade of summits. Meyer and Zwart (2020) highlighted how the inaugural Virtual Summit created an opportunity for a wide community to participate and network in the data-intensive aquatic sciences but had definite needs for improvement in speaker representation. Although an ever-increasing ease in conducting science virtually has enabled for the summits to run more smoothly, the most noticeable improvement for the summits has been the representation of speakers and those involved in the community. Although the first summit strove for diverse representation, the finalized speaker list fell short of those goals. Meyer and Zwart (2020) suggested that more diverse speaker representation could be achieved through inviting speakers further in advance of the summit, creating opportunities for panels, and intentionally focusing on soliciting speakers from a range of backgrounds. Since 2020, the workshops and summits have grown to include speakers and organizers of numerous backgrounds, identities, and experiences (Tables 2 and 3). Likely as a result of our intentional focus on increasing representation, the reach of AEMON-J and DSOS beyond a primarily North American audience has also grown. Although earlier summits had higher synchronous participation (~120–160 people), the previous 3 years have maintained high registration (457–684 people) and synchronous attendance (40–140 people). While opportunity abounds to improve on these foundations, the organizing team is enthusiastic about the overwhelming positive responses the workshops and summits have received. With the growth of data-intensive aquatic science, the organizational team is confident that we have identified a needed space where modelers from numerical, machine learning, and statistical backgrounds can converge, discuss, and share experiences centered on data science and open science topics (Meyer and Zwart 2020). The scale, scope, pace, and dynamism of this workshop and virtual summit are reflections of the interest in this nexus, and we look forward to seeing how it grows in the future.

Fire is also used throughout the world for reducing agricultural waste and clearing land. Wildland fires are one of the largest sources of pollutants to the global atmosphere with major impacts on air quality and climate. Fire also disturbs terrestrial and aquatic systems and poses numerous environmental impacts in areas near the fire and downwind ecosystems. With climate change increasingly driving higher fire activity, understanding the environmental impacts of wildland fires will continue to become more important.As the research community strives to understand the full complexity of fire and its environmental impacts, the research questions continue to expand. To capture the latest scientific developments in this area, the Environmental Science & Technology (ES&T) portfolio of journals (ES&T, ACS ES&T Air, and ES&T Letters) recently launched a new special issue call for papers entitled ""Wildland Fires: Chemistry, Contamination, Climate and Human Health"", with a submission deadline of September 2, 2024. To complement this, we have collated previously published research on this topic from ES&T, ES&T Letters, and ACS ES&T Water from 2020 to present as a virtual collection that highlights nascent wildfire research topics. The papers chosen are grouped by topic and introduced below.Wildland Fire EmissionsClick to copy section linkSection link copied!Nearly half a century of wildland fire emissions research exists. However, due to the complex emissions chemistry of wildland fires, key data gaps remain alongside challenges representing this complexity in emissions inventories and air quality models. Measurements by Peng et al. (1) during the WE-CAN (Western Wildfire Experiment for Cloud chemistry, Aerosol absorption and Nitrogen) Campaign found emitted HONO (nitrous acid) to be the dominant contributor to oxidant radicals during the first few hours of plume age along with ozone (O3) as the dominant radical source downwind. Sekimoto et al. (2) describe a novel approach using VOC (volatile organic compounds) emission profiles from low- and high-temperature pyrolysis integrated into satellite fire radiative power to estimate speciated VOC emissions from western wildfires sampled during the FIREX-AQ (Fire Influence on Regional and Global Environments and Air Quality) Campaign. Pagonis et al. (3) addressed another area of emissions complexity, by accounting for the organic aerosol volatility information to better constrain the estimated particulate matter (PM) emissions in a smoke forecasting model.Wildland Urban Interface FiresClick to copy section linkSection link copied!Increasing fire activity combined with population growth in areas intermixed or adjacent to wildlands, also known as the wildland urban interface (WUI), has led to an increase in the number of wildfires that move into urban areas and burn buildings and vehicles. Petersen et al. (4) have shown that the risk of urban wildfire exposure has increased as climate-driven fire danger has increased. These WUI fires can cause mass destruction and loss of life and pose serious environmental challenges such as emissions of toxic compounds to the air, contamination of water systems, and contaminated soil that can further impact air through wind-blown dust and waterways through runoff. Boaggio et al. (5) identified an increase in the levels of toxic metals in WUI fire smoke, such as copper and lead, that increased with the increasing scale of destruction pointing to the urban materials as the likely source of these compounds. Villarruel et al. (6) identified some of these same toxic metals in the ashes of WUI fires and found them to be in a more bioavailable form than those compounds naturally found in soil.Brown CarbonClick to copy section linkSection link copied!Wildland fires may be the largest source of primary brown carbon (BrC) and BrC precursors to the atmosphere. The concentration, optical properties, and lifetime of BrC remain active research areas. Hettiyadura et al. (7) provided a comprehensive characterization on the composition, volatility, viscosity, and optical properties of laboratory-generated BrC. They used this rich data set to call attention to how BrC fractions with different polarity have different optical and physical properties, suggesting that measurement methods that subject BrC to low-pressure conditions could volatilize the weaker chromophores leaving a darker more viscous particle. Gregson et al. (8) found that BrC viscosity impacted rates of reaction with O3, which may impact atmospheric bleaching rates. Multiple studies examined the variation of optical properties during reaction with oxidants. These studies found that oxygenated hydrocarbons can react with NO3 (nitrate radicals) formed overnight (or HONO in dark plume cores) forming secondary BrC and increasing BrC light absorption, (9−11) in addition to generating more toxic nitroaromatics. (12)The combination of complex chemistry, physical properties, and the propensity to bleach and darken in the atmosphere means it remains challenging to represent BrC in climate models (7) and to monitor for BrC in the atmosphere. Chen et al. (13) developed a novel method for assigning brownness to organic carbon measurements at routine monitoring locations and were able to use this data set to identify BrC trends at a national scale. They observed heightened wintertime brownness and increased urban versus rural brownness, and only moderate brownness of wildfire plumes. These results demonstrate that while wildland fires may be a major source of atmospheric BrC there may be other significant sources and atmospheric processes that are contributing.Atmospheric Evolution of Wildland Fire SmokeClick to copy section linkSection link copied!A major objective of wildland fire research is to differentiate the impact of wildland fire smoke on air quality and health from the impact of other pollution sources. This has proved to be complex because wildfire smoke undergoes numerous changes as it cools, dilutes, and reacts in the atmosphere while simultaneously mixing with atmospheric emissions from other pollutant sources during its atmospheric lifetime. During this process, other harmful pollutants, like O3, can form, further degrading air quality and posing challenges for downwind areas to meet air quality regulations.Recent research has measured plume evolution by different approaches to better understand the key factors controlling O3 formation, including remote sensing, (14) aircraft studies, (15) and ground-based studies. (16) Other important factors determining O3 formation rates include the time of day of emission, (15) the location in the plume, (17) and plume history, including mixing with urban air and other pollutants. (16) In addition, O3 formation can be highly variable depending on the conditions. For example, wildfire plumes are often NOx (nitrous oxides) limited and may have shaded areas with limited photolysis rates, resulting in straightforward O3 formation only at the edges of the plume where sunlight and precursors are abundant. Ozone formation may also be impacted by external factors (e.g., nearby urban NOx sources) as the plume ages and is transported downwind, which results in variable O3 formation as observed in numerous wildland fire plumes. (14)Decker et al. (18) highlighted how radical chemistry differs between daytime and nighttime plume evolution and the importance of the NO3 radicals in driving nighttime chemistry based on observations from the SENEX (Southeast Nexus) Campaign in conjunction with a detailed chemical box model. This was also seen in plumes emitted later in the day (15) as well as in the dark cores of fresh plumes (17) observed during FIREX-AQ. The importance of these other reaction pathways is now being investigated in the laboratory to better understand the NO3-dependent formation pathways for BrC and degradation of BrC from photolysis or O3 oxidation. Atmospheric plume evolution is also important for determining the volatilization of primary organic aerosol (3) and the formation of secondary organic carbon as well as the addition of and eventual loss of organic coatings on black carbon. (19)Air Quality ModelingClick to copy section linkSection link copied!Over the past decade, a proliferation of observational data has emerged with new satellite products, a rapid expansion of lower-cost PM sensors, and the continued advancement of air quality models and modeling approaches. Multiple research groups have taken advantage of these big data sets and statistical methods (e.g., machine learning) to generate air quality data that are impacted by smoke versus air quality data that are not impacted by smoke at high spatial and temporal resolution over extended periods of time. (20−22) Schneider et al. (20) used back trajectory models to identify pollution from satellite fire detects to elucidate a clear increase in the level of PM2.5 from wildfires but a minimal increase in the levels of CO (carbon monoxide) and NO2 (nitrogen dioxide) and mixed effects on the level of O3, once again demonstrating the complex relationship between wildfire smoke and O3 formation.Despite major advances in smoke modeling, Considine et al. (23) show that some commonly used machine learning-based models are not able to predict the very high ground-level concentrations near wildfires. Cleland et al. (24) found that increasing the number of ground-level observations near fires can greatly improve model performance and points to the need for more monitoring data near fires to support statistical model approaches that rely on ambient data as input. Furthermore, Zhang et al. (22) used lower-cost sensor data to show that areas not covered by air quality monitoring stations have higher smoke impacts, meaning that smoke exposures are underestimated by most models and the full extent of public health impacts from smoke is not known.Source ApportionmentClick to copy section linkSection link copied!Source apportionment studies are used to identify the impact of wildfires on air quality or ecosystems. Levoglucosan has long been used as a tracer for biomass burning activities, but recent research in China has reported there are numerous other minor sources of levoglucosan (25) and that the degradation of levoglucosan in the atmosphere (26) can result in an underestimation of the attribution of wildland fire smoke to ambient pollutant concentrations. An alternative approach is to use carbon isotope measurements such as those of Liu et al. (27) that underscored the inaccuracy of levoglucosan as a tracer for wildland fire. Liu et al. (27) also demonstrated the importance of wildland fire as a source of dissolved organic carbon in the Tibetan Plateau just as Kirago et al. (28) identified savanna burning as a major source of background aerosols in sub-Saharan Africa.HealthClick to copy section linkSection link copied!Understanding the relative contribution of wildland fire smoke to ambient air pollution can help to answer another key research question, which is whether wildland fire smoke is more harmful than other types of pollution sources. Additionally, is smoke from some fires more harmful if inhaled than others, such as smoke from wildfires versus prescribed fires, vegetative fires versus WUI fires, high- versus low-intensity fires, etc.? Researchers have probed the complex chemistry of wildland fire emissions in laboratory experiments to better understand the factors that may result in health effects. For example, Koval et al. (29) found that flaming peat emissions were most biologically active as evidenced by changes in the transcriptome of exposed mice, while smoldering peat was least active. Other researchers have found that aged smoke caused increased oxidative potential and inflammation. (30,31) Xu et al. (32) developed a national scale model of PM2.5 oxidative potential (i.e., the ability to cause oxidative damage, which may be related to increased health impacts) in Canada, finding an association between oxidative potential and wildfire smoke. More attention is also being paid to the hazards from the gas phase components of wildfire smoke, with studies by O'Dell et al. (33) and Navarro et al. (34) both showing that some gas phase smoke constituents may pose substantial health risks in addition to that from PM2.5. This risk has important implications for common exposure reduction methods like air cleaners that may be effective in removing only PM.EcosystemsClick to copy section linkSection link copied!The impacts of wildfires on ecosystems has become increasingly important as the scale and severity of wildfires have increased. Paul and co-workers (35) reported clear deficiencies in our understanding of wildfire effects on downwind ecosystems with more information needed on how wildfires impacted endangered species and protected lands. Bhattarai et al. (36) attributed nitrogen deposition in the Tibetan Plateau to wildland fires in South Asia, resulting in levels above the critical load threshold, potentially resulting in adverse ecosystem impacts.Water QualityClick to copy section linkSection link copied!Wildland fires can also have an impact on water quality, including contamination of drinking water systems. This was observed in California following the 2018 Camp Fire, where VOCs in contaminated service lines were studied. Contaminants associated with pyrolysis of PVC (polyvinyl chloride) and polyethylene as well as uncontrolled burning of biomass and waste materials were detected, providing evidence that wildfires can cause contamination by both thermal damage to plastic pipes and intrusion of smoke. (37) Benzene contamination was found to be more abundant in service connections to destroyed structures versus standing homes, likely arising from chemical pyrolysis products being pulled into these lines due to loss of system pressure. Therefore, the ability to quickly shut off sections of water systems that depressurize, coupled with backflow prevention, may help reduce contamination from smoke. (38) In addition, a study by Schulze et al. (39) found that burn severity, as measured by the density of damaged structures, was correlated with the probability of VOC contamination in a water sample exceeding California maximum contamination levels. This could also provide useful information for WUI water utilities regarding the implementation of mitigation strategies and location of vulnerabilities to minimize potential damage from future wildland fires.This Collection of previously published papers across the journals ES&T, ES&T Letters, and ACS ES&T Water highlights the wide range of environmental challenges posed by wildland fire and the progress that has been made in better understanding the impacts of fire on human health, ecosystems, and the climate.We hope you enjoy this curated collection as a useful reference point summarizing recent advances in this important field of research.Author InformationClick to copy section linkSection link copied!Corresponding AuthorsAmara L.

(American Chemical Society) Wildfires are an important source of HONO, a photo-labile radical precursor, yet in-situ measurements and quantification of primary HONO emissions from open wildfires are scarce. Airborne observations of HONO within wildfire plumes sampled during the Western Wildfire Expt. for Cloud Chem., Aerosol Absorption and Nitrogen (WE-CAN) campaign were obsd. ΔHONO:ΔCO ratios close to fire locations were 0.7-17 pptv/ppbv, using a max. enhancement method, with a median similar to previous observations of temperate forest fire plumes. Measured HONO:NOx enhancement ratios were generally factors of 2 or higher at early plume ages vs. previous studies. Enhancement ratios scaled with modified combustion efficiency and certain nitrogenous trace gases, which may be useful to est.

As the climate warms, wildfire activity is increasing, posing a risk to human health. Studies have reported on particulate matter (PM) in wildfire smoke, yet the chemicals associated with PM have received considerably less attention. Here, we analyzed 13 years (2006-2018) of PM2.5 chemical composition data from monitors in California on smoke-impacted days. Select chemicals (e.g., aluminum and sulfate) were statistically elevated on smoke-impacted days in over half of the years studied. Other chemicals, mostly trace metals harmful to human health (e.g., copper and lead), were elevated during particular fires only. For instance, in 2018, lead was more than 40 times higher on smoke days on average at the Point Reyes monitoring station, due mostly to the Camp Fire, burning approximately 200 km away. There was an association between these metals and the combustion of anthropogenic material (e.g., the burning of houses and vehicles). Although still currently rare, these infrastructure fires are likely becoming more common and can mobilize trace metals in smoke far downwind, at levels generally unseen except in the most polluted areas of the country. We hope a better understanding of the chemicals in wildfire smoke will assist in the communication and reduction of public health risks. >> More from SciFinder ®https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A280%3ADC%252BB283kt1Cksg%253D%253D&md5=725b335e7ccdfa2ecea3de248bfd9e406Villarruel, C.

The mol. compn. of these samples was investigated using reversed-phase liq. chromatog. coupled with a photodiode array detector and a high-resoln. mass spectrometer. The results revealed two sets of BrC chromophores: common to all four samples and specific to the ""oily"" fractions. The common BrC chromophores consist of polar, monoarom. species. The oil-specific BrC chromophores include less-polar and nonpolar polyarom. compds. The most-light-absorbing pyrolysis oily phase (PO) was aerosolized and size-sepd. using a cascade impactor to compare the compn. and optical properties of the bulk vs. the aerosolized BrC. The mass absorption coeff. (MAC300-500 nm) of aerosolized PO increased compared to that of the bulk, due to gas-phase partitioning of more volatile and less absorbing chromophores. The optical properties of the aerosolized PO were consistent with previously reported ambient BB BrC measurements. These results suggest the darkening of atm.

Fire is also used throughout the world for reducing agricultural waste and clearing land. Wildland fires are one of the largest sources of pollutants to the global atmosphere with major impacts on air quality and climate. Fire also disturbs terrestrial and aquatic systems and poses numerous environmental impacts in areas near the fire and downwind ecosystems. With climate change increasingly driving higher fire activity, understanding the environmental impacts of wildland fires will continue to become more important.As the research community strives to understand the full complexity of fire and its environmental impacts, the research questions continue to expand. To capture the latest scientific developments in this area, the Environmental Science & Technology (ES&T) portfolio of journals (ES&T, ACS ES&T Air, and ES&T Letters) recently launched a new special issue call for papers entitled ""Wildland Fires: Chemistry, Contamination, Climate and Human Health"", with a submission deadline of September 2, 2024. To complement this, we have collated previously published research on this topic from ES&T, ES&T Letters, and ACS ES&T Water from 2020 to present as a virtual collection that highlights nascent wildfire research topics. The papers chosen are grouped by topic and introduced below.Wildland Fire EmissionsClick to copy section linkSection link copied!Nearly half a century of wildland fire emissions research exists. However, due to the complex emissions chemistry of wildland fires, key data gaps remain alongside challenges representing this complexity in emissions inventories and air quality models. Measurements by Peng et al. (1) during the WE-CAN (Western Wildfire Experiment for Cloud chemistry, Aerosol absorption and Nitrogen) Campaign found emitted HONO (nitrous acid) to be the dominant contributor to oxidant radicals during the first few hours of plume age along with ozone (O3) as the dominant radical source downwind. Sekimoto et al. (2) describe a novel approach using VOC (volatile organic compounds) emission profiles from low- and high-temperature pyrolysis integrated into satellite fire radiative power to estimate speciated VOC emissions from western wildfires sampled during the FIREX-AQ (Fire Influence on Regional and Global Environments and Air Quality) Campaign. Pagonis et al. (3) addressed another area of emissions complexity, by accounting for the organic aerosol volatility information to better constrain the estimated particulate matter (PM) emissions in a smoke forecasting model.Wildland Urban Interface FiresClick to copy section linkSection link copied!Increasing fire activity combined with population growth in areas intermixed or adjacent to wildlands, also known as the wildland urban interface (WUI), has led to an increase in the number of wildfires that move into urban areas and burn buildings and vehicles. Petersen et al. (4) have shown that the risk of urban wildfire exposure has increased as climate-driven fire danger has increased. These WUI fires can cause mass destruction and loss of life and pose serious environmental challenges such as emissions of toxic compounds to the air, contamination of water systems, and contaminated soil that can further impact air through wind-blown dust and waterways through runoff. Boaggio et al. (5) identified an increase in the levels of toxic metals in WUI fire smoke, such as copper and lead, that increased with the increasing scale of destruction pointing to the urban materials as the likely source of these compounds. Villarruel et al. (6) identified some of these same toxic metals in the ashes of WUI fires and found them to be in a more bioavailable form than those compounds naturally found in soil.Brown CarbonClick to copy section linkSection link copied!Wildland fires may be the largest source of primary brown carbon (BrC) and BrC precursors to the atmosphere. The concentration, optical properties, and lifetime of BrC remain active research areas. Hettiyadura et al. (7) provided a comprehensive characterization on the composition, volatility, viscosity, and optical properties of laboratory-generated BrC. They used this rich data set to call attention to how BrC fractions with different polarity have different optical and physical properties, suggesting that measurement methods that subject BrC to low-pressure conditions could volatilize the weaker chromophores leaving a darker more viscous particle. Gregson et al. (8) found that BrC viscosity impacted rates of reaction with O3, which may impact atmospheric bleaching rates. Multiple studies examined the variation of optical properties during reaction with oxidants. These studies found that oxygenated hydrocarbons can react with NO3 (nitrate radicals) formed overnight (or HONO in dark plume cores) forming secondary BrC and increasing BrC light absorption, (9−11) in addition to generating more toxic nitroaromatics. (12)The combination of complex chemistry, physical properties, and the propensity to bleach and darken in the atmosphere means it remains challenging to represent BrC in climate models (7) and to monitor for BrC in the atmosphere. Chen et al. (13) developed a novel method for assigning brownness to organic carbon measurements at routine monitoring locations and were able to use this data set to identify BrC trends at a national scale. They observed heightened wintertime brownness and increased urban versus rural brownness, and only moderate brownness of wildfire plumes. These results demonstrate that while wildland fires may be a major source of atmospheric BrC there may be other significant sources and atmospheric processes that are contributing.Atmospheric Evolution of Wildland Fire SmokeClick to copy section linkSection link copied!A major objective of wildland fire research is to differentiate the impact of wildland fire smoke on air quality and health from the impact of other pollution sources. This has proved to be complex because wildfire smoke undergoes numerous changes as it cools, dilutes, and reacts in the atmosphere while simultaneously mixing with atmospheric emissions from other pollutant sources during its atmospheric lifetime. During this process, other harmful pollutants, like O3, can form, further degrading air quality and posing challenges for downwind areas to meet air quality regulations.Recent research has measured plume evolution by different approaches to better understand the key factors controlling O3 formation, including remote sensing, (14) aircraft studies, (15) and ground-based studies. (16) Other important factors determining O3 formation rates include the time of day of emission, (15) the location in the plume, (17) and plume history, including mixing with urban air and other pollutants. (16) In addition, O3 formation can be highly variable depending on the conditions. For example, wildfire plumes are often NOx (nitrous oxides) limited and may have shaded areas with limited photolysis rates, resulting in straightforward O3 formation only at the edges of the plume where sunlight and precursors are abundant. Ozone formation may also be impacted by external factors (e.g., nearby urban NOx sources) as the plume ages and is transported downwind, which results in variable O3 formation as observed in numerous wildland fire plumes. (14)Decker et al. (18) highlighted how radical chemistry differs between daytime and nighttime plume evolution and the importance of the NO3 radicals in driving nighttime chemistry based on observations from the SENEX (Southeast Nexus) Campaign in conjunction with a detailed chemical box model. This was also seen in plumes emitted later in the day (15) as well as in the dark cores of fresh plumes (17) observed during FIREX-AQ. The importance of these other reaction pathways is now being investigated in the laboratory to better understand the NO3-dependent formation pathways for BrC and degradation of BrC from photolysis or O3 oxidation. Atmospheric plume evolution is also important for determining the volatilization of primary organic aerosol (3) and the formation of secondary organic carbon as well as the addition of and eventual loss of organic coatings on black carbon. (19)Air Quality ModelingClick to copy section linkSection link copied!Over the past decade, a proliferation of observational data has emerged with new satellite products, a rapid expansion of lower-cost PM sensors, and the continued advancement of air quality models and modeling approaches. Multiple research groups have taken advantage of these big data sets and statistical methods (e.g., machine learning) to generate air quality data that are impacted by smoke versus air quality data that are not impacted by smoke at high spatial and temporal resolution over extended periods of time. (20−22) Schneider et al. (20) used back trajectory models to identify pollution from satellite fire detects to elucidate a clear increase in the level of PM2.5 from wildfires but a minimal increase in the levels of CO (carbon monoxide) and NO2 (nitrogen dioxide) and mixed effects on the level of O3, once again demonstrating the complex relationship between wildfire smoke and O3 formation.Despite major advances in smoke modeling, Considine et al. (23) show that some commonly used machine learning-based models are not able to predict the very high ground-level concentrations near wildfires. Cleland et al. (24) found that increasing the number of ground-level observations near fires can greatly improve model performance and points to the need for more monitoring data near fires to support statistical model approaches that rely on ambient data as input. Furthermore, Zhang et al. (22) used lower-cost sensor data to show that areas not covered by air quality monitoring stations have higher smoke impacts, meaning that smoke exposures are underestimated by most models and the full extent of public health impacts from smoke is not known.Source ApportionmentClick to copy section linkSection link copied!Source apportionment studies are used to identify the impact of wildfires on air quality or ecosystems. Levoglucosan has long been used as a tracer for biomass burning activities, but recent research in China has reported there are numerous other minor sources of levoglucosan (25) and that the degradation of levoglucosan in the atmosphere (26) can result in an underestimation of the attribution of wildland fire smoke to ambient pollutant concentrations. An alternative approach is to use carbon isotope measurements such as those of Liu et al. (27) that underscored the inaccuracy of levoglucosan as a tracer for wildland fire. Liu et al. (27) also demonstrated the importance of wildland fire as a source of dissolved organic carbon in the Tibetan Plateau just as Kirago et al. (28) identified savanna burning as a major source of background aerosols in sub-Saharan Africa.HealthClick to copy section linkSection link copied!Understanding the relative contribution of wildland fire smoke to ambient air pollution can help to answer another key research question, which is whether wildland fire smoke is more harmful than other types of pollution sources. Additionally, is smoke from some fires more harmful if inhaled than others, such as smoke from wildfires versus prescribed fires, vegetative fires versus WUI fires, high- versus low-intensity fires, etc.? Researchers have probed the complex chemistry of wildland fire emissions in laboratory experiments to better understand the factors that may result in health effects. For example, Koval et al. (29) found that flaming peat emissions were most biologically active as evidenced by changes in the transcriptome of exposed mice, while smoldering peat was least active. Other researchers have found that aged smoke caused increased oxidative potential and inflammation. (30,31) Xu et al. (32) developed a national scale model of PM2.5 oxidative potential (i.e., the ability to cause oxidative damage, which may be related to increased health impacts) in Canada, finding an association between oxidative potential and wildfire smoke. More attention is also being paid to the hazards from the gas phase components of wildfire smoke, with studies by O'Dell et al. (33) and Navarro et al. (34) both showing that some gas phase smoke constituents may pose substantial health risks in addition to that from PM2.5. This risk has important implications for common exposure reduction methods like air cleaners that may be effective in removing only PM.EcosystemsClick to copy section linkSection link copied!The impacts of wildfires on ecosystems has become increasingly important as the scale and severity of wildfires have increased. Paul and co-workers (35) reported clear deficiencies in our understanding of wildfire effects on downwind ecosystems with more information needed on how wildfires impacted endangered species and protected lands. Bhattarai et al. (36) attributed nitrogen deposition in the Tibetan Plateau to wildland fires in South Asia, resulting in levels above the critical load threshold, potentially resulting in adverse ecosystem impacts.Water QualityClick to copy section linkSection link copied!Wildland fires can also have an impact on water quality, including contamination of drinking water systems. This was observed in California following the 2018 Camp Fire, where VOCs in contaminated service lines were studied. Contaminants associated with pyrolysis of PVC (polyvinyl chloride) and polyethylene as well as uncontrolled burning of biomass and waste materials were detected, providing evidence that wildfires can cause contamination by both thermal damage to plastic pipes and intrusion of smoke. (37) Benzene contamination was found to be more abundant in service connections to destroyed structures versus standing homes, likely arising from chemical pyrolysis products being pulled into these lines due to loss of system pressure. Therefore, the ability to quickly shut off sections of water systems that depressurize, coupled with backflow prevention, may help reduce contamination from smoke. (38) In addition, a study by Schulze et al. (39) found that burn severity, as measured by the density of damaged structures, was correlated with the probability of VOC contamination in a water sample exceeding California maximum contamination levels. This could also provide useful information for WUI water utilities regarding the implementation of mitigation strategies and location of vulnerabilities to minimize potential damage from future wildland fires.This Collection of previously published papers across the journals ES&T, ES&T Letters, and ACS ES&T Water highlights the wide range of environmental challenges posed by wildland fire and the progress that has been made in better understanding the impacts of fire on human health, ecosystems, and the climate.We hope you enjoy this curated collection as a useful reference point summarizing recent advances in this important field of research.Author InformationClick to copy section linkSection link copied!Corresponding AuthorsAmara L.

(American Chemical Society) Wildfires are an important source of HONO, a photo-labile radical precursor, yet in-situ measurements and quantification of primary HONO emissions from open wildfires are scarce. Airborne observations of HONO within wildfire plumes sampled during the Western Wildfire Expt. for Cloud Chem., Aerosol Absorption and Nitrogen (WE-CAN) campaign were obsd. ΔHONO:ΔCO ratios close to fire locations were 0.7-17 pptv/ppbv, using a max. enhancement method, with a median similar to previous observations of temperate forest fire plumes. Measured HONO:NOx enhancement ratios were generally factors of 2 or higher at early plume ages vs. previous studies. Enhancement ratios scaled with modified combustion efficiency and certain nitrogenous trace gases, which may be useful to est. HONO release when HONO observations are lacking or plumes have photochem. exposures >1 h, since emitted HONO is rapidly photolyzed. HONO photolysis was the dominant contributor to hydrogen oxide radicals (HOx = OH- + HO2) in the early stage (<3 h) wildfire plume evolution.

As the climate warms, wildfire activity is increasing, posing a risk to human health. Studies have reported on particulate matter (PM) in wildfire smoke, yet the chemicals associated with PM have received considerably less attention. Here, we analyzed 13 years (2006-2018) of PM2.5 chemical composition data from monitors in California on smoke-impacted days. Select chemicals (e.g., aluminum and sulfate) were statistically elevated on smoke-impacted days in over half of the years studied. Other chemicals, mostly trace metals harmful to human health (e.g., copper and lead), were elevated during particular fires only. For instance, in 2018, lead was more than 40 times higher on smoke days on average at the Point Reyes monitoring station, due mostly to the Camp Fire, burning approximately 200 km away. There was an association between these metals and the combustion of anthropogenic material (e.g., the burning of houses and vehicles). Although still currently rare, these infrastructure fires are likely becoming more common and can mobilize trace metals in smoke far downwind, at levels generally unseen except in the most polluted areas of the country. We hope a better understanding of the chemicals in wildfire smoke will assist in the communication and reduction of public health risks. >> More from SciFinder ®https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A280%3ADC%252BB283kt1Cksg%253D%253D&md5=725b335e7ccdfa2ecea3de248bfd9e406Villarruel, C.

The mol. compn. of these samples was investigated using reversed-phase liq. chromatog. coupled with a photodiode array detector and a high-resoln. mass spectrometer. The results revealed two sets of BrC chromophores: common to all four samples and specific to the ""oily"" fractions. The common BrC chromophores consist of polar, monoarom. species. The oil-specific BrC chromophores include less-polar and nonpolar polyarom. compds. The most-light-absorbing pyrolysis oily phase (PO) was aerosolized and size-sepd. using a cascade impactor to compare the compn. and optical properties of the bulk vs. the aerosolized BrC. The mass absorption coeff. (MAC300-500 nm) of aerosolized PO increased compared to that of the bulk, due to gas-phase partitioning of more volatile and less absorbing chromophores. The optical properties of the aerosolized PO were consistent with previously reported ambient BB BrC measurements. These results suggest the darkening of atm.

Retrieving useful information and insights from images taken by satellite or any other aerial imagery system requires a good understanding of the information present in the images itself. This work focuses on the design and implementation of an automated model to extract semantic maps of waterways, roadways, buildings to track urban cities growth of satellite imagery. As it is a machine learning problem, a deep neural network is implemented and evaluated experimentally. Open source, publicly available frameworks and datasets are used in this work. The result of this work is a pre-processing image model, which enables the user to take an input image with different quality and resolution and apply the semantic segmentation on it. U-Net is used as the underlying architecture for this project, because of many advantages and functionalities it provides, as an example, we can say less computation time, which can help starters in the field of AI and computer vision to build their prototype and models fast without the need of too much hardware (GPU, Processor, and RAM). To get a better result and decrease the amount of pressure on machine, FCN (Fully Connected Neural Network) is used along with U-Net. As FCN has skip layer function and it also makes the network to learn faster and give more accurate results than CNN due to normalizing the pooling layers which in CNN it makes the network to lose lots of information about the data. The primary purpose of this work is to implement Semantic Segmentation on satellite images taken from urban areas, SpaceNet dataset provides such a data. The data selected for this project is from Khartoum (Capital of Sudan), it is a developing and deserted city. The result of this work will help in managing resources such as agriculture, natural energy, and water, checking on natural disasters and responding to it, like floods, earthquakes, and tsunamis checking on environmental use such as deforestation and monitoring urban development.","",https://doi.org/10.1109/iccmc48092.2020.iccmc-00069,"",,

To develop cost-effective agricultural solutions, 90% intensification of technological farming is required for achieving agricultural inputs and market demands. Today, the agricultural sector is affected by various factors like increased labor costs, increased population, crop failures, unpredictable yields, extreme weather, climate change, market fluctuations, etc. All these factors have directly or indirectly affected the socioeconomic status of farmers. With such a large number of challenges and increasing demands there is a need to implement an artificial intelligence-based approach for developing smart farming environment for the real-time monitoring and management of agricultural issues. According to a UN report, two-thirds of the world population will migrate to urban areas, resulting in a major decline in the agricultural workforce. This chapter proposes a smart farming environment based on artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain technology (BCT). Artificial Intelligence can be harnessed to automate and manage the agricultural and related tasks while blockchain technology can help in intensifying agri-food and supply chains. A sensational AI-based approach will help in developing the smart farming environment that can efficiently gather and monitor data for the real-time monitoring to address the uncertain issues faced by the agricultural community. BCT can handle issues related to the increased demands for agricultural products with transparency and trust. It will also accompany a variety of certifications schemes on branded agricultural products that face issues related to claims, labels and adulterations. BCT can prove to be an efficient solution for agricultural products’ safety, quality and sustainability. It will ensure the permanency of records during data sharing. The use of ICT in the agricultural sector will provide more efficient solutions for effective water and land usage resulting in maximum agricultural yields.

In Ukraine by official data, by 2019 118000 square meters of trees were cut illegally. The total losses this year due to illegal logging were 814 million of hryvna. This problem is still actual, because in Ukraine there is no tool for independent monitoring of forestry at the state level. It can be solved by the use of machine learning and deep learning approaches and satellite data, that can produce in the operational mode actual data about forest state in the country. This research demonstrate the result of deforestation detection with use of state-of-the-art approaches: multi-layer perceptron, long short term memory recurrent neural network. These neural networks were trained using various satellite data: 10 meters spatial resolution Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 images. Results obtained with the use of the different methods and data collections show that the best accuracy can be obtained by the combination of SAR and optical data using time series of satellite and recurrent neural networks. However, performance of the state-of-the-art deep learning approaches is insufficient for fully automated deforestation detection system that works on the country level.

rayyan-220234224,A deep learning based approach for inferring the distribution of potential extreme events from coarse resolution climate model output,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Frequency based climate change attribution of extreme weather events requires thousands of years worth of model output in order to obtain a statistically sound result. Additionally, extreme precipitation events in particular require a high resolution model as they can occur over a relatively small area. Unfortunately due storage and computational restrictions it is not feasible to run traditional models at a sufficiently high spatial resolution for the complete duration of these simulations. Instead, we suggest that deep learning could be used to emulate a proportion of a high resolution model, at a fraction of the computational cost. More specifically, we use a U-Net, a type of convolutional neural network. The U-Net takes as input, several fields from coarse resolution model output and is trained to predict corresponding high resolution precipitation fields. Because there are many potential precipitation fields associated with the coarse resolution model output, stochasticity is added to the U-Net and a generative adversarial network is employed in order to help create a realistic distribution of events. By sampling the U-Net many times, an estimate of the probability of a heavy precipitation event occurring on the sub-grid scale can be derived.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu2020-7559,"",,

Recently developed fully reversible networks can mostly avoid memory limitations by virtue of having a low and fixed memory requirement for storing network states, as opposed to the typical linear memory growth with depth. Fully reversible networks enable the training of deep neural networks that take in entire data volumes, and create semantic segmentations in one go. This approach avoids the need to work in small patches or map a data patch to the class of just the central pixel. The cross-entropy loss function requires small modifications to work in conjunction with a fully reversible network and learn from sparsely sampled labels without ever seeing fully labeled ground truth. We show examples from land-use change detection from hyperspectral time-lapse data, and regional aquifer mapping from airborne geophysical and geological data.","",,"",,

The data from remote sensing satellites provide opportunities to acquire information about land at varying resolutions and has been widely used for object studies. The importance of the exponential increase in the image data volume and multiple sensors and associated challenges on the development of object detection techniques are highlighted. Object detection is the task of detecting objects in an image in the form of a bounding box. Challenges faced in object detection include non-trivial noisiness, blurring and lower resolutions compared to aerial images. Objects may overlap and have different textures or alternately, adjacent objects may have similar texture, which can prevent identification of contours separating them. This task can either be carried out by a domain expert (manually) or automatically by employing machine learning. Machine learning techniques if implemented properly may give results better than a human and can also reduce the expenditure to a very large extent. To get a more accurate information about the object, more than a rectangle (bounding box), maybe a polygon which represents the object more tightly is preferred. But that’s still not the best way. The best way would be to assign each pixel inside the bounding box which actually has the object. This task is called as Instance segmentation, where the object instances are segmented. This project implements Instance Segmentation using deep learning to extract geographical features from satellite maps. It’s called Mask R-CNN, assumes a basic understanding of deep learning and CNNs for object detection.","",,"",,

Motivated by the pressing need to understand, from a hydro-ecological perspective, how the dynamic nature of the hydrologic cycle will impact the environment in water-stressed regions, we implemented a novel approach that predicts precipitation spatio-temporal trends over the drought-burdened region of East Africa, based on other major hydrological components, such as vegetation water content (VWC), soil moisture (SM) and surface temperature (ST). The spatial patterns and characteristics of the inter-relations among the four aforementioned hydrologic variables were investigated over regions of East Africa characterized by different vegetation types and for various precipitation intensity rates during 2003-2011. To this end, we analyzed multi-year satellite microwave remote sensing observations of SM, ST, and VWC (derived from Naval Research Laboratory's WindSat radiometer) as well as their response to precipitation patterns (derived from NASA's TRMM 3B42 V7). We categorized precipitation into four bins (ranges) of intensity and trained five different state-of-the-art machine learning models for each of these categories. The models were then applied to predict the spatiotemporal precipitation dynamics over this complex region. Specifically, the Random Forest and Linear Regression models outperformed the others with the normalized mean absolute error being less than 27% for all of the categories. The characteristics of the predicted precipitation were in turn used to classify vegetation regimes in East Africa. Our results indicate significant discrepancies in the performance of the models with varying values in the predicting skill as well as their ability to accurately classify vegetation into different types.

However, they are also highly vulnerable to pollution, water abstraction and land use change. Here, we aimed to develop a “dirty‐water” predictive model that could be used to create recovery scenarios and analyze the effect of measures on the biological quality of reservoirs. Accordingly, we constructed a machine learning predictive model that was trained with environmental and macroinvertebrate community data from 129 sites, sampled in six reservoirs in Northeast Brazil. Two different rehabilitation scenarios were simulated (D1 = lower improvement, 25% change; and D2 = higher improvement, 75% change), and three initial levels of disturbance were considered based on PCA analyses: least disturbed, moderately disturbed and severely disturbed. The effects were analyzed in terms of changes in expected taxa (E), observed/expected taxon ratio (OE), biotic and trophic status indices and the spatial distribution of sensitive taxa . The simulations resulted in significant improvements ( p &lt; .001) for all disturbance levels and indicators analyzed. Furthermore, rehabilitation measures in artificial systems, such as reservoirs, could result in a higher biodiversity, biological quality and water quality, also in the least disturbed sites. Thus, this approach has the potential to provide information on management and conservation measures, since the simultaneous predictions of many taxa can be used, including: mapping the distribution of species; monitor the population dynamics of species at risk of extinction; and determining the best rehabilitation measures to improve disturbed ecosystems, allowing the determination of the most cost‐effective restoration measures.","",https://doi.org/10.1002/rra.3641,"",,

In Southeast Asia, tropical peatland forest fires are a major environmental issue having a significant effect on the climate and causing extensive social, health and economical impacts. As a result, forest fire prediction has emerged as a key challenge in computational sustainability. Existing forest fire prediction systems, such as the Canadian Forest Fire Danger Rating System (Natural Resources Canada), are based on handcrafted features and use data from instruments on the ground.

The maximum likelihood classifier, the decision tree and the artificial neural network are the three most popular supervised classifiers used by the remote sensing community for land cover/land use mapping. The maximum likelihood classifier is one of the most popular methods of classification in remote sensing, in which a pixel with the maximum likelihood is classified into the corresponding class. Land cover/land use are two important indicators of the Earth surface's (bio)physical and socioeconomical characteristics. Monitoring and assessing the Land cover/land use change can be used as a decision support system to evaluate landscape usage and future planning.

However, these numerical simulators have difficulties representing precipitation events accurately, mainly due to limited spatial resolution when simulating multi-scale dynamics in the atmosphere. To improve the prediction of high resolution precipitation we apply a Deep Learning (DL) approach using an input of CM simulations of the model fields (weather variables) that are more predictable than local precipitation. To this end, we present TRU-NET (Temporal Recurrent U-Net), an encoder-decoder model featuring a novel 2D cross attention mechanism between contiguous convolutional-recurrent layers to effectively model multi-scale spatio-temporal weather processes. We use a conditional-continuous loss function to capture the zero-skewed %extreme event patterns of rainfall. Experiments show that our model consistently attains lower RMSE and MAE scores than a DL model prevalent in short term precipitation prediction and improves upon the rainfall predictions of a state-of-the-art dynamical weather model. Moreover, by evaluating the performance of our model under various, training and testing, data formulation strategies, we show that there is enough data for our deep learning approach to output robust, high-quality results across seasons and varying regions.","",,"",,
rayyan-220234628,Slavery from space: an analysis of the modern slavery-environmental degradation nexus using remote sensing data,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Modern slavery has been connected to degradation of the environment, and has been found to contribute to anthropogenic climate change. Three sectors have been investigated using satellite Earth Observation (EO) data in order to provide a unique insight into the modern slavery-environmental degradation nexus. Remote sensing affords a unique ability to measure and understand these ecological changes over large timescales, and vast geographical areas. A local, regional, and global assessment of sectors known to heavily use modern slavery practices within their workforce has been undertaken using a variety of remotely sensed data sources and products. Fish-processing, brick kilns, and tree loss associated with multiple sectors, have all been analysed.
Levels of environmental damage in the affected sectors have been noted, and measured using satellite EO data. These effects have included: tree loss of mangroves and tropical forests for fish-processing camps and oil palm plantations; the emission of pollutants which contribute to atmospheric climate change; the extraction of resources, such as groundwater and good-quality topsoil; and changes to landcover and land-use in areas that are important for production of food and economic support for large populations.
Over the course of this investigation, ten post-harvest fish-processing camps have been located, and the first replicable methodology for estimating the number of brick kilns in the South Asian ‘Brick Belt’ region has been provided – where open access satellite EO data enabled the estimation of 55,387 brick kilns. The latter has since enabled machine learning methodologies to provide accurate locations and kiln ages which have assisted in the environmental assessment of this large-scale transnational industry. Furthermore, if modern slavery practices were eliminated from this industry, the environmental impact of the brick-making could be reduced by the equivalent of almost 10,000 kilns. Finally, tree loss has been quantified and the policy implications of deforestation and forest degradation as a result of modern slavery have been explored in four countries. Ultimately, there are a large variety of environmentally degrading activities known to use modern slavery practices that may be explored using satellite EO data. Remote sensing throughout this thesis has enabled the exploration of these implications for some sectors, and proved the proof of concept that additional data acquisition from remotely sensed sources, can support in the overall goal of assisting in the understanding and eradication of modern slavery. 
Satellite EO is an underutilised methodology within the antislavery community and, as shown within this thesis, there is the power to investigate the environmental implications of these sectors which have had numerous documented cases of modern slavery. In order to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) – particularly target 8.7 which aims to end modern slavery by 2030 – multiple avenues of investigation are required to understand, locate, and eradicate modern slavery. Applying remote sensing to assess the ecological impact of these cases is one such avenue that can provide information to assist in this achievement, and support the success of multiple SDGs.

Using remote sensing data combined with machine learning techniques (k-means clustering and artificial neural networks), we show that in the wettest parts of the Amazon rainforest, gross primary production and evapotranspiration continue to increase alongside atmospheric dryness, i.e. vapor pressure deficit, despite reductions in ecosystem conductance. On the other hand, Earth system models have the opposite photosynthetic response to vapor pressure deficit in the wettest part of the Amazon, overestimating its reductive effect on tropical vegetation photosynthesis and evapotranspiration, leading to an exaggerated carbon source to the atmosphere. As vapor pressure deficit is expected to increase with climate change, our study highlights the importance of reframing how we understand and represent the response of ecosystem photosynthesis to atmospheric dryness in the wettest ecosystems, to accurately quantify the future land carbon sink and atmospheric CO2 growth rate.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu2020-5195,"",,

In Alpine regions, fires are often at the start of cascading risks including avalanches, mudslides or rock fall due to the loss of forest and vegetation layers. Additionally, wildfires are expected to occur more frequently in the future as a result of a warming climate, which is estimated to affect alpine regions in particular.&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span&amp;gt;Fire danger forecasts, such as the commonly used Fire Weather indices, indicate the danger of forest fires based on numerical weather forecasts. Such indices are typically available at coarse spatial resolutions and, hence, have limited use in mountainous regions with their highly variable weather and other environmental conditions. Stakeholders, such as fire departments and forest managers, require more detailed forecasts in order to make robust decisions and efficiently plan their resources. The CONFIRM project, which started in December 2019 with funding from the Austrian Research Promotion Agency (FFG) under the Austrian Space Applications Programme (ASAP), addresses this gap by using high-resolution earth observation data provided by the European Copernicus programme to develop a pre-operational fire danger forecast system.&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span&amp;gt;Data from both optical and microwave sensors aboard satellites are known to be sensitive to changes in soil and vegetation water content. Exploiting this sensitivity, satellite data with high temporal and spatial resolutions from the Copernicus Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 missions will be used to estimate fuel moisture state. The estimates will be integrated with airborne Laser-scanning (LiDAR) data, high-resolution weather forecasts, socioeconomic and topographic data to develop a novel, high-resolution integrated forest fire danger system (IFDS) for Austria. The project team will apply its expertise in forest management, remote sensing, fire science and machine learning to estimate fire danger using the Austrian fire database, an extensive record of historic fire events, as a training dataset. Key stakeholders from national weather services (ZAMG, DWD), fire brigades, state forest administrations and infrastructure providers (Austrian Railways &amp;amp;#214;BB) are continuously involved in the project to develop the IFDS according to their requirements.

These canals are used to control water table depth and make the soil suitable for planting, but their presence has the negative impact of drying out peat soils near the ground surface. Drier soils in turn cause elevated fire risk, increased carbon release to the atmosphere, and subsidence. Although canals directly impact local peat hydrology, the effect of drainage intensity (i.e. canal density) in peatlands has not been quantitatively investigated, due to a lack of reliable canal maps in the region.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;In this study, we trained a machine learning model to identify drainage canals and map their density throughout Southeast Asian peatlands using remote sensing imagery. Specifically, a fully convolutional neural network was applied to RGB 5m resolution Basemap imagery from Planet. Training data was generated by hand-labeling canals from satellite images, and validation of canal density was performed via comparison to independently labeled maps. A map of canal density was then produced across ISEA peatlands using images from 2017. We compared canal density with land use type and found that mean canal density is highest in industrial plantations. We also compared canal density with fire occurrence and subsidence data. This new dataset has potential applications for studies of peatland hydrology, land use change, and fire risk.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu2020-12505,"",,

As direct monitoring of biodiversity is not possible, proxy variables have been used to indicate site&amp;amp;#8217;s species richness and quality. In boreal forests, European aspen (Populus tremula L.) is one of the most significant proxies for biodiversity. Aspen is a keystone species, hosting a range of endangered species, hence having a high importance in maintaining forest biodiversity. Still, reliable and fine-scale spatial data on aspen occurrence remains scarce and incomprehensive. Although remote sensing-based species classification has been used for decades for the needs of forestry, commercially less significant species (e.g., aspen) have typically been excluded from the studies. This creates a need for developing general methods for tree species classification covering also ecologically significant species.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#160;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Our study area, located in Evo, Southern Finland, covers approximately 83km&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;, and contains both managed and protected southern boreal forests. The main tree species in the area are Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.), Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.)

We test and compare different machine learning methods (Support Vector Machines, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Machine) and deep learning methods (3D convolutional neural networks), with specific emphasis on accurate and feasible aspen detection. The results will show, how accurately aspen can be detected from the forest canopy, and which bandwidths have the largest importance for aspen.

rayyan-220234677,Multi-temporal mapping of pantropical post-loss land cover using dense earth-observation time series and global pre-existing maps,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Deforestation remains one of the largest contributors to global greenhouse emissions. Despite the efforts in monitoring forest change, there is still a lack of pan-tropical spatially-explicit data informing the subsequent land cover (LC) changes over deforested areas (also known as post-loss LC). Based on this premise, this research focuses on predicting post-loss LC over deforested areas as detected by Terra-i, an early warning system of pantropical forest change providing alerts every 16-days from 2004 to present at spatial resolution of 250 m. A supervised deep neural network model suited to extract spatio-temporal patterns from dense earth observation time series data was leveraged in this work by using 16-day MODIS images of 2015. The model was trained according to nine labelled datasets representing different number of LC classes and complexity. These datasets were generated from pre-existing global LC maps with a native spatial resolution ranging from 100 m to 500 m. The effectiveness of the trained models in producing accurate predictions of post-loss LC was assessed over the Amazon region, the largest continuous region of tropical forest in the world. A two-stage assessment approach was conducted to determine the most suitable labelled datasets to predict post-loss LC over Terra-i&amp;amp;#8217;s areas. For the first stage, traditional metrics for the assessment of the quality of LC thematic data &amp;amp;#8212; e.g. overall accuracy, per-class mapping accuracy, area (or quantity) disagreement and allocation disagreement &amp;amp;#8212; were computed according to the test partitions from the labelled datasets. A second stage consisted in using the trained models in 2015 to make predictions for all available years of MODIS satellite imagery, from 2001 to 2018, across seven representative areas distributed in the Amazon. The observed LC predictions were masked using annual aggregated data of Terra-i from 2004 to 2010. The post-LC data by trained model, which represents a given labelled dataset, was verified by i) visualising the temporal and spatial distribution of the most frequent subsequent LC changes; and ii) comparing with Mapbiomas Amazonia, a regional-tuned multi-temporal LC dataset from 2000 to 2017 for the whole Amazon. The results showed that one out of the nine labelled datasets allowed the supervised deep learning model to produce reasonable spatial predictions and classification accuracies (overall accuracy of 86.36&amp;amp;#177;0.64, area disagreement of 5.34&amp;amp;#177;0.39 and allocation disagreement of 8.31&amp;amp;#177;0.64) according to the test partition data. Moreover, the trained model provided similar patterns of post-loss LC as informed by the Mapbiomas dataset. Due to the nature of the model (i.e. neural network) and input data (i.e. global), it is expected the model is scalable to other pantropical areas. The insights and products derived throughout this study are targeted to reduce current uncertainties and challenges in the calculation of global and regional drivers and impacts of deforestation in tropical forests and landscapes.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu2020-389,"",,

rayyan-220234733,EarthNet2021: A novel large-scale dataset and challenge for forecasting localized climate impacts,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Climate change is global, yet its concrete impacts can strongly vary between different locations in the same region. Seasonal weather forecasts currently operate at the mesoscale (> 1 km). For more targeted mitigation and adaptation, modelling impacts to < 100 m is needed. Yet, the relationship between driving variables and Earth's surface at such local scales remains unresolved by current physical models. Large Earth observation datasets now enable us to create machine learning models capable of translating coarse weather information into high-resolution Earth surface forecasts. Here, we define high-resolution Earth surface forecasting as video prediction of satellite imagery conditional on mesoscale weather forecasts. Video prediction has been tackled with deep learning models. Developing such models requires analysis-ready datasets. We introduce EarthNet2021, a new, curated dataset containing target spatio-temporal Sentinel 2 satellite imagery at 20 m resolution, matched with high-resolution topography and mesoscale (1.28 km) weather variables. With over 32000 samples it is suitable for training deep neural networks. Comparing multiple Earth surface forecasts is not trivial. Hence, we define the EarthNetScore, a novel ranking criterion for models forecasting Earth surface reflectance. For model intercomparison we frame EarthNet2021 as a challenge with four tracks based on different test sets. These allow evaluation of model validity and robustness as well as model applicability to extreme events and the complete annual vegetation cycle. In addition to forecasting directly observable weather impacts through satellite-derived vegetation indices, capable Earth surface models will enable downstream applications such as crop yield prediction, forest health assessments, coastline management, or biodiversity monitoring.

rayyan-220234734,Projection and prediction of heat waves for an arid region in the context of climate change,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Forecasting temperature extremes especially heat waves are extremely important for developing preparedness and planning mitigation measures, particularly in the context of climate change. The major objective of the present study was to assess the ongoing changes and possible future changes in heat waves and development of robust statistical model for forecasting heat wave which can adapt with changing climate. Pakistan, which is one of the most affected countries of the world to heat waves in recent years was considered as the study area. Novelties of the study are the methods proposed for defining heat waves, reliable projection of heat waves with associated uncertainties, and development of robust forecasting models which can adapt with climate change. Available in-situ temperature records, gauge-based gridded temperature data and temperature simulations of general circulation data (GCM) of Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) were used for defining heat waves and assessment of historical changes and future projections of temperature extremes and heat waves, while the reanalysis atmospheric data of National Centres for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) was used for the development of heat wave forecasting models. A threshold-based approach which able to demarcate the historical heat wave affected area is proposed for defining heat waves, GCMs were selected based on their capability to simulate different characteristics of heat waves and different state-of-the-art machine learning methods (ML) were used for the development of the seasonal and daily heat wave forecasting models. The study revealed that the daily maximum temperature more than 95-th percentile threshold for consecutive five days or more can well reconstruct the spatial pattern of heat wave in Pakistan. The assessment of trends in heat waves based on the derived definition revealed increase in heat wave duration and affected area in Pakistan at a rate of 0.71 days/decade and 1.36% of the total area of Pakistan per decade respectively. Four GCMs namely, CCSM4, CESM1(BGC), CMCC-CM and NorESM1-M were found to have better ability for the projection of all the characteristics of heat waves. The projection of heat waves using the selected GCMs revealed a high increase in the heat wave indices particularly for representative concentration pathways (RCP) 8.5. Heat wave frequency was projected to increase up to 12 events per year in most parts of the country, while some areas would experience heat waves for more than 100 days in a year. The higher increase in heat waves indices was projected in highly populated eastern and southern coastal regions which are already prone to high occurrence of heat waves. Forecasting models were developed for the prediction of triggering date and seasonal number of heat waves days in order to aid in coping and mitigation capacity revealed that the Quantile Regression Forests (QRF) models were able to forecast the triggering and departure dates of heat waves with an accuracy of up to ±5 days. On the other hand, the Support Vector (SVM) model was found to have the higher skills in forecasting number of heat wave days with a month time-lag (R2: 0.89- 0.9, NRMSE%: 32.6-31.8, rSD: 0.98-0.96, and md: 0.8). The analysis of synoptic patterns revealed that the wind vectors, relative humidity and geopotential height are the most potential indicators of heat waves in Pakistan. The forward-rolling based forecasting model proposed for the prediction of heat waves to accommodate the changing pattern of the atmospheric variables responsible for heat waves due to the changes in climate was found to forecast heat waves reliably.","",,"",,
rayyan-220234830,Monitoring of levee breaching through remote sensing and artificial intelligence,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The study of flooding events resulting from bank over-flooding and levee breaching is of large interest for both society and environment, because flood waves, resulting from levee failure, might cause loss of lives and destruction of properties and ecosystems. Understanding the subsoil mechanics and the fluid-solid interplay allows the stability condition estimate of dams, embankments and slopes and the development of early warning alarm systems. Changes in soil and hydraulic parameters are usually monitored by geotechnical and geophysical investigations that also provide the basic assumptions for developing hydraulic models. Nowadays, remote sensing approaches, including satellite techniques, are mainly used for flooding simulation studies. Indeed, remote sensing observations, such as discharge, flood area extent and water stage, have been used for retrieving flood hydrology information and modeling, calibrating and validating hydrodynamic models, improving model structures and developing data assimilation models. Although all these studies have contributed significantly to the recent advances, uncertainty in observations, as well as in model parameters and prediction, represents a critical aspect for using remote sensing data in the flooding defence. Compared to past and current methods for monitoring the fluvial levee failure, we propose a new procedure that provides a wide and fast alert system. The proposed methodological path is based on presumed relationships between ground level deformation and hydrological and surface soil properties, due to physical mechanisms and exhibited by geodetic and hydrological time series. The procedure is accomplished first through multi-methodological comparative analyses applied to geodetic, hydrological and soil-properties patterns, then through the mapping of the river zones prone to failure. Since the input consists of time series satellite-derived data, the geospatial Artificial Intelligence is applied for extracting knowledge from spatial big data and for increasing the performance of data computing. In particular, machine learning is initially developed for selecting the relevant geographical areas (i.e. rivers, levees and riverbanks) from large geo-referential datasets. Then, since the spatial-distributed points are also time-dependent, the trends of different datasets are compared point by point by selected analytical techniques. Finally, in accordance with the acquired knowledge from previous steps, the system extracts information on the correlation indexes in order to make sense of patterns in space and time and to identify hierarchic orders for the realization of hazard maps. The proposed method is &amp;amp;#8220;wide&amp;amp;#8221; because, unlike other direct surveys, it is able to monitor large spatial areas since it is based on satellite-derived data. It is also &amp;amp;#8220;fast&amp;amp;#8221; because it is based on the Earth&amp;amp;#8217;s surface observation and is not connected with Earth&amp;amp;#8217;s inland investigations (such as the geotechnical and geophysical ones) or with forecasting models (e.g. hydraulic and flooding simulations). Due to these peculiarities, the method can support flood protection studies and can be used for driving the localization of river portions prone to failure, where focusing detailed geotechnical and geophysical surveys.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu2020-3324,"",,

Thus, generating high-resolution spatiotemporal products of carbon fluxes remains a major challenge. Machine Learning (ML) techniques are a promising approach to upscale this information to regional and global scales and can thereby help to produce better NEE datasets for earth-system modelling.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Our approach uses statistical relationships between NEE, vegetation indices and meteorological variables to train a Random Forest model with spatial feature selection to predict daily NEE values at 1 km spatial resolution for the Rur-catchment area (ca. 2400 km&amp;amp;#178;) in western Germany. Data from twelve Eddy stations of different land use types of the TERENO Network Eifel/Lower Rhine Valley between 2010 and 2018 were used to train and test the ML model. Factors potentially affecting NEE such as vegetation indices (NDVI, EVI, LAI) extracted from MODIS products, incoming solar radiation from Heliosat (SARAH-2) and additional meteorological variables from COSMO REA6 reanalysis products served as independent variables, which were further evaluated in regard to their relative importance for NEE prediction.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;A novel spatial cross-validation scheme has been applied and compared to a conventional random k-fold cross-validation. This is important for the assessment of the model performance regarding spatial predictions beyond the scope of training locations in contrast to mere data reproduction. Results indicate a lower model performance evaluated with spatial cross-validation and that conventional random cross-validation hence leads to an overoptimistic view of the prediction skills.

In this study, a method was proposed to generate 250m spatial resolution LAI product from Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer(MODIS) surface reflectance data using general regression neural networks (GRNNs). A dataset from MODIS surface reflectance product (MOD09Q1), MODIS observation geometry data, and Global Land Surface Satellite (GLASS) LAI product during the period from 2001-2017 was used to train the GRNNs in this study. Because the spatial resolution of these data are inconsistent, we proposed a downscaling method based on pure pixels to unify the spatial resolution of these data to 250m. we can get the GRNNs by training these datasets. Then, the MOD09Q1 surface reflectance and the corresponding observation geometry are entered into the GRNNs to retrieve LAI values. The retrieved LAI values were compared with the Geoland3 (GEOV3) LAI product and validated by ground measured LAI values.

rayyan-220234934,A machine learning assessment of multi-resolution remote sensing data for Natura 2000 dune habitat classification,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Coastal dunes habitats are in the transition zone of marine and terrestrial ecosystems and therefore have high biodiversity in terms of animal and vegetation species. These species provide important ecosystem services to the human kind. Due to the development and operation of Maasvlakte 2, an increase of nitrogen emission is expected in the province Zuid-Holland of the Netherlands. When this is taken up by the vegetation and soil in the dunes, encroachment by shrubs will dominate. This will lead to a decrease in species diversity of dune habitats in protected areas of the Natura 2000 network, which is an unfavourable situation conforming to the Nature Protection Law (Wet Natuurbescherming). The main loss is expected to be in grey dunes and humid dune slacks of the Natura 2000 areas nearby Maasvlakte 2. This research focuses on the classification of grey dunes, white dunes, humid dune slacks, woody vegetation, water and their sub-classes in the Natura 2000 areas Solleveld a Kapittelduinen, Voornes Duin and Goeree a Kwade Hoek. Remote sensing in combination with machine learning have been proven to be useful in the monitoring of dune habitats. Open access satellite data provide high temporal and geographic coverage, but are often limited in their spatial resolution. Contrarily, high spatial resolution products are limited in their spectral resolution. In this thesis, the effects of spatial resolution, spectral features and feature combinations on the classification of dune habitats using aerial images and a Landsat-7 image (2012) are analysed. The classifications are performed with a Random Forest classifier, using both a pixel-based and region-based approach. In contrast to the traditional pixel-based method, the region-based method incorporates spectral and statistical information of neighbouring pixels. The best performance is achieved with the region-based approach on a 4m resolution aerial image with an accuracy of 87%. The 10m region-based classification is the second best with an accuracy of 83%. The misclassified pixels are mostly classified as the other sub-class of the same main-class. The region-based method should not be applied to satellite images with low spatial resolution as it causes more loss of detail. More spectral bands contribute to a better classification performance, but they contribute less than the spectral bands that were already used. Also, Landsat-7 images were used to create yearly habitat maps for 2012 and 2019 to subsequently analyse the habitat changes between those years, although the accuracies of the Landsat-7 maps are an issue. The main changes in habitat are found in the woody vegetation (shrubs, trees) and humid dune slacks. The woody vegetation decreased in area, causing an increase in grey dunes area in Voornes Duin and Goeree a Kwade Hoek, whereas the opposite has happened in Solleveld a Kapittelduinen. Loss of area in humid dune slacks is detected in all three regions of interest. The local dune manager confirmed that the detected changes in woody vegetation are mostly correct and caused by dune management activities. The perceived changes in humid dune slacks are less reliable. Finally, a modified training dataset is used to classify Sentinel-2 images in 2019. These results compared reasonably well with the few locations we visited during our fieldwork campaign.","",,"",,

The development of reliable methods for flood simulation have greatly improved our ability to predict floods thereby reducing damages and loss of life in flood-prone regions. However, there is still a lot of room for improvement and innovation to provide better predictions, especially for flash floods, particularly in urban areas &amp;amp;#160;This is addressed in the present study, the goal of which it is to improve simulation and prediction of flash floods and to develop a spatial decision-making model for implementing flood protection measures. In this regard, different approaches for flood simulation and flood protection should be applied. The proposed methodology links flood hazard modeling, remote sensing and machine learning methods. Combining these physical models and data driven methods will result in a more reliable hybrid model that can be employed for prediction of (flash) floods and event analysis. In order to achieve the research goal of present study we: i) add more functionality to a hydrodynamic model code; ii) complement the latter with data driven methods ;iii) develop a spatial decision-making model framework for defining flood protection measures, iv) validate process-based and data driven methods, and finally v) cross-evaluate Light Detection And Radar (LiDAR) topography with available local super-resolution drone data to assess the ability to incorporate local flood defenses into the models. The most important outcome is the creation of valuable flood maps in areas where it matters - while accounting for effects of land use and climate change. This will serve scientists as well as land and risk management authorities with better actionable flood risk information in locations where people and assets are located and in danger. It also develops innovative methodologies for estimating the changing risk from flash floods based on land use scenarios and climate change projections. Moreover, developing spatial multi-criteria decision making (SMCDM) can help decision makers to determine suitable locations and methods for flood protection measures. These methods will be particularly valuable in the context of solving current challenges of accounting for and mitigating flash floods and the effects of climate change.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu2020-13319,"",,

Transverse Aeolian Ridges (TARs), periodic bedrock ridges (PBRs), dust devils, dust devil tracks, and/or windstreaks are common within the rover&amp;#8217;s landing ellipse. These aeolian features can be used to characterize the paleo and contemporary aeolian environment of the landing region before the start of rover operations. Here we present new measurements of the orientation, morphologies, and directionality of TARs, PBRs, windstreaks, and active dust devils, in order to better understand the wind regime at the landing site, on a continuum of spatial and temporal scales. &amp;#160;Methods We used machine learning (Novelty or Anomaly Hunter &amp;#8211; HiRISE [NOAH-H])[1] and manual mapping-derived TAR and PBR distributions, as well as feature orientation and crest-line lengths to elucidate regional wind patterns in a 640 km2 area of Oxia Planum (Fig.1). The area was gridded into 160 four km2 quadrants, with every second quadrant analyzed. TAR crestlines were manually digitized as continuous and discontinuous ripples, based on NOAH-H ontological classes (Barrett et al., in prep). Continuous ripples are found at a variety of scales (metres to tens of metres in across-bedform length) and consist of patches of parallel ripples which merge into one another. Discontinuous ripples are features in which the aeolian bedforms are separated by areas of non-aeolian material, including those that are isolated on the surface and those which form part of a sparse patch overlying any non-aeolian material. PBRs were identified based on NOAH-H bedrock classes, as well as their morphology and texture, similar to PBRs found elsewhere on Mars[2] and Earth[3].We used multiple change detection techniques on HiRISE, HRSC, and CaSSIS imagery to determine migration rates of TARs and to track active dust devils and analyze wind streaks [4-8].Results and DiscussionWe digitized the crestlines of 7989 continuous ripples and 2764 discontinuous ripples. TAR along-crestline lengths range from 1.1 m to 556 m. Meter-scale TARs are common across the study area but decameter-scale TARs are uncommon, and are primarily found in topographic lows. Irrespective of the scale of the bedform, we found crestline azimuths to be consistent across the study area. Based upon terrestrial megaripple research using the difference in albedo to determine the stoss and lee slopes of ripples in the Argentinian Puna[9], coupled with the crestline azimuths determined from digitizing the landforms, we posit that the winds responsible for the expression of TARs in Oxia Planum blew from the NW-NNW towards the SE-SSE (Fig.2). Crestlines for 457 PBRs were digitized, and found to be longer than TAR crestline-lengths: PBRs have ridge-crests that range in length from ~4 m to just over 600 m. Azimuths of PBRs were found to be substantially different than TARs, requiring winds to have blown from the N-NNE or the S-SSE, accounting for 180&amp;#176; ambiguity. However, analysis of coregistered and orthorectified repeat HiRISE imagery over 11 Earth years showed no appreciable movement in TAR fields in the study area.Two active dust devils were identified in the study area using HRSC images. One dust devil moved from the NW to the SE, while the second travelled from the SW to the NE. From a pair of CTX images taken 50 Earth days apart, 6 active dust devils and 649 dust devil tracks and/or windstreaks were identified. The features are predominantly oriented in a WNW-ESE direction with a secondary NEN-SWS noted for a few of the tracks (Fig.2).The computed azimuths for TARs, PBRs, dust devils and dust devil tracks and/or windstreaks are markedly different (Fig.2), suggesting that different formative winds would have been necessary to result in the directionality of bedforms, landforms, and dust devils we currently see in Oxia Planum. These results pose important questions about the wind regime in this area. When were the winds responsible for TARs and PBRs active?&amp;#160; And if contemporary winds are not responsible for TAR and PBR orientation, when did the wind regime shift? To begin answering these questions, our work will focus on comparing the results from this morphological study with modelled climate data in order to help determine when and why the wind regime changed.Looking forwards to the surface mission, the surface platform for the Rosalind Franklin rover will carry a meteorological package that will provide in situ wind measurements. We can compare those data to our morphologically- and modelled-derived results. The rover itself will be able to analyze the granulometry of TARs and the bedrock strata of PBRs using imaging data, further assisting us to characterize the winds from a geomorphological standpoint. These datasets will provide further understanding of the aeolian regime of the Oxia Planum area and provide valuable insight into the climatic history of Mars.&amp;#160;References[1] Barrett et al.

rayyan-220234970,Using a model-of-models approach and remote sensing technologies to improve flood disaster alerting,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Floods are happening regularly in almost all places of the world and impact people, societies and economies, causing widespread devastation that can be hard to recover from. Yet, accurately predicting and alerting for floods is challenging, primarily since flood events are very local in nature and processes causing a flood can be very complex. In an era of open-access geospatial data proliferation as well as data and model interoperability, it makes sense to leverage on existing data and models, many of which are underutilized by decision-making applications. Thus, the objective of the project is to develop an open-access rapid alerting and severity assessment component for global flooding based on existing models and observation data sources. We do this within the DisasterAWARE platform of the Pacific Disaster Center (PDC).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This paper will outline the proposed concept of model-of-models that will leverage existing flood-hazard modeling capabilities, illustrating products that we will leverage, such as: GLOFAS (Global Flood Forecasting Feeds) probabilistic hydrologic data, IMERG (The Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for GPM) observed precipitation grids, GDACS (Global Disaster Alerting Coordination System) anomaly points, GFMS (Global Flood Monitoring System) depth above baseline grids, the NASA MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) and Dartmouth Observatory flood maps, as well as new models as they are developed. We will further combine the flood hazard data with existing exposure data to estimate property loss using a probabilistic fragility approach. With the use of an end-to-end deep learning framework, structural damage will be detected using different remote sensing data. The approach will further incorporate other, non-routinely-generated remotely-sensed products for ground-truthing for areas and events where and when such products are available.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The existing resilience and capacity of communities to rapidly respond to and recover from flood impacts will be incorporated into the severity determination on an administrative area and watershed risk basis. This model-of-models approach will leverage major efforts, improve reliability and reduce false triggers by ensuring two or more models agree.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu2020-13113,"",,
rayyan-220234995,Uncertainty in soil hydraulic properties limits the predictability of global water and carbon dynamics,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Water transport at the land surface and in the soil &amp;amp;#8211; the critical zone - is highly dependent on the soil hydraulic properties. Such properties influence simultaneously the terrestrial water and carbon cycles as they determine the water fluxes in the soil and the soil&amp;amp;#8217;s water holding capacity, ultimately affecting runoff production, groundwater recharge, and the amount and temporal variability of plant available water (i.e. plant water stress). Despite their paramount importance, limited global information concerning the spatial distribution of soil hydraulic properties currently exists. Information at the global scale, commonly used in Earth System Models, mostly originates from pedotransfer functions (PTFs). PFTs are empirical relations that express the dependence of soil hydraulic properties on easily measured attributes as soil properties. Several PFTs currently exist, which adopt different formulations, spanning from simple linear regressions to elaborate machine learning, and are trained with different datasets, yielding different soil hydraulic properties for the same soil texture. &amp;amp;#160;&amp;amp;#160;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The question we ask in this study is: how does uncertainty in the soil hydraulic parameters propagate in global ecosystem responses? To achieve this, we deploy a numerical experiment covering many different ecosystems. The terrestrial ecosystem model T&amp;amp;C is used to model energy, water, and carbon dynamics at 80 locations worldwide, spanning all climatological regimes, major biomes and soil types. Soil hydraulic properties at each site were estimated using six widely used PTFs starting from local soil textural information. Uncertainty propagation from soil hydraulic properties to modelled ecosystem dynamics was evaluated for all sites and its dependence on soil textural properties and local topography was quantified.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Our results highlight that uncertainty propagation from hydraulic properties to ecosystem dynamics is much stronger for hydrological fluxes (e.g. infiltration, groundwater recharge and runoff production) than carbon dynamics (e.g. gross and net primary productivity and leaf area dynamics) or energy fluxes (net radiation, sensible and latent heat). Uncertainty in hydrological fluxes can be up to 400% using different PTFs, whereas uncertainties in carbon and energy fluxes are typically less than 20%. The largest uncertainties were observed for slow draining soils, containing large fractions of clay, located in regions with intermediate values of wetness (i.e. annual precipitation &amp;amp;#8776; annual potential evapotranspiration). Complex topographic features further enhance the role of uncertainty in soil hydraulic properties. Lateral water redistribution affects both runoff production and soil moisture dynamics increasing the effects on both hydrological and carbon dynamics.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu2020-7127,"",,

Pattern recognition tasks such as classification, object detection, and segmentation (i.e. pixel-level classification) have remained challenging problems in the weather and climate sciences. Deep learning has shown remarkable success in similar problems in computer vision, robotics, and other domains. In this chapter we take a look at various deep learning models which attempt to solve identification, detection, localization and segmentation as applied to climate data.

rayyan-220235080,Deep Learning for the Parametrization of Subgrid Processes in Climate Models,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Earth system and climate models are fundamental to understanding and projecting climate change. Although they have improved significantly over the last decades, considerable biases and uncertainties in their projections still remain. A large contribution to this uncertainty stems from differences in the representation of clouds and convection (i.e., deep clouds) occurring at scales smaller than the resolved model grid resolution that is typically in the order of 100 km in the horizontal. These long-standing deficiencies in cloud parametrizations have motivated developments of high-resolution cloud- and turbulence-resolving models that can explicitly resolve clouds and convection, yet are computationally extremely expensive and can therefore only be run for a short time and/or only over a small region. However, together with the recent developments in machine learning, and especially deep learning, these simulations can be used and harvested to develop new ML-based parametrizations for clouds and convection that have the potential to eliminate some of the long-standing systematic errors in climate models. Recent research demonstrated that deep convection explicitly simulated by a cloud-resolving climate model could be correctly emulated by a deep neural network that then replaced the original parametrization in the climate model. In this chapter we describe the principal approaches for ML-based cloud parametrizations with deep neural networks and advocate that these ML algorithms need to be guided both by data and by physical knowledge. Many challenges in this new interdisciplinary field of research remain that are also discussed.","",https://doi.org/10.1002/9781119646181.ch21,"",,

rayyan-220235090,An Approach to Mapping Deforestation in Permanent Forest Reserve Using the Convolutional Neural Network and Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Forests are essential for the protection of biodiversity and provide essential ecosystem services to humankind. Globally, 1.6 billion people depend on forests as fuel sources, construction materials, medicine, food, and freshwater sources. However, according to the monitoring service Global Forest Watch, our world lost 12 million hectares (30 million acres) of tropical tree cover in 2018, equal to 30 football pitches a minute. Surprisingly, Malaysia was among the top six countries that year with tremendous losses. Therefore, stern action is needed to increase public knowledge of ecosystem threats, improve strategic forest management decisions, and enforce land-use policies. This study aims to map deforestation in Permanent Forest Reserve (HSK) Yong in Pahang between 2017 and 2020 using satellite images of Sentinel-1 SAR. We further automate the classification of forest and non-forest by using a small and straightforward Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model architecture. Our model used an open-source machine learning framework, namely Orfeo ToolBox TensorFlow (OTBTF). As well as machine learning, deep learning can be applied by OTBTF without image size restrictions and is computationally efficient, regardless of hardware configuration. The methodology includes data pre-processing, RGB composition, patches sampling, TensorFlow model train, TensorFlow model serve, and verification. Results show that the CNN approach with the Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) was 81.57 percent of the overall accuracy and the Kappa index was 0.6313. In brief, the approach mentioned in this study provides an alternative and reasonable approach for the HSK deforestation mapping in Peninsular Malaysia.","",https://doi.org/10.1109/camp51653.2021.9498144,"",,
rayyan-220235125,Hybridizing Machine Learning and Physically-based Earth System Models to Improve Prediction of Multivariate Extreme Events (AI Exploration of Wildland Fire Prediction),,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Focal Areas: This project responds to two focal areas identified in the DOE Call for AI4ESP White Papers: 1) Predictive modeling through the use of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, and 2) insights gleaned from complex data using explainable AI and big data analytics. Science Challenge: Large wildland fires (hereafter wildfires) appearing as high-impact compound climate extreme events are closely related to hydroclimate and water cycle extremes that modulate surface fuel supply and combustibility. These compound events have multivariate climatic features (e.g., temperature, precipitation, relative humidity, wind, lightning) and societal drivers (e.g., forest management, land use change, human caused ignitions). Meanwhile, they induce strong feedbacks to the coupled atmosphere, biosphere, and hydrosphere by perturbing regional and global radiation budget as well as ecological, biogeochemical, and water cycles across multiple spatiotemporal scales. The nonlinear interactions between these natural and anthropogenic components of the Earth system are too complex to be completely and adequately represented in today’s Earth system models (ESMs). The inherent stochastic nature of fire activity at all scales further increases the difficulty of its prediction using ESMs that are usually developed from deterministic equations and parameterizations. Besides, concurrence of long-term (decadal to interdecadal) global climate change and fire regime shifts overlapping with short-term (intraseasonal to interannual) variations of regional fire weather and burning activity confound predictability of these compound extreme events. We propose to address the above scientific challenges by using machine learning (ML)-based data-driven modeling techniques to integrate observations and physically-based ESMs’ simulations in a computationally efficient hybrid prediction system. This prediction system is supposed to characterize the wildfire’s sensitivity to climate and exogenous drivers at high resolution (~ 0.25°) on subseasonal to seasonal (S2S) timescales providing improved predictability and explainability. We will use the system to help identify: (1) What are the computational elements of a hybrid system needed to predict compound climate extreme events such as global wildfires? (2) What are the key drivers (either natural or anthropogenic) that modulate short-term variations of multivariate fire weather and burning activity over different regions? How can one take advantage of those driver-response relationships to improve the predictability of large wildfires on S2S time scales? (3) What are the underlying physical mechanisms and sources of improved predictability? Which ML techniques are optimal in revealing and adapting these mechanisms?","",https://doi.org/10.2172/1769718,"",,

This book shows how cutting-edge technologies such as artificial intelligence, including neural networks and deep learning, can be applied for processing satellite data for Earth observation. One of the objectives of this book is to explain how to develop a set of libraries for the implementation of artificial intelligence that could overcome some limits and encompass different aspects of research, ranging from data fusion to speckle filtering.

rayyan-220235172,Deforestation Prediction using Ensemble of Convolutional Neural Network Models,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Deforestation is the destruction of forest due to for a non-forest purpose [1]. The disadvantages due to deforestation are an increased amount of carbon dioxide emissions and soil erosion. Increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere increases temperature of the earth, leading to climate change. Also the destruction of forest habitat and the loss of biological diversity of both plants and animals occurs. With increased deforestation earth will lose its top fertile soil layer and get converted into desert. The ecological balance will get disturbed and floods and drought will become more frequent. Wildlife will also be affected. As of now there only one habitable planet, and we need to conserve all life and environment. The surface area of earth is around 510.1 million km2. In this about 29.2% is earths land area. And in that land area only around 30% is the Forest area [2]. There are several studies taken to monitor the deforestation happening in all over the world as well as India. One of the notable ones is which gives the data of loss of 28% forest covers over eight decades. The major deforestation has occurred due to conversion of forests to agricultural lands, timber product, construction of major projects such as reservoirs in dams, road construction etc. Several global, legally binding instruments (LBIs) have instituted requirements for national-level inventory and reporting (UNFF 2004c:7). The recently effective Kyoto Protocol requires the inventorying of land use-related deforestation, afforestation, and reforestation in developed country Parties. For afforestation to occur, it requires more active coordination to support, the environmental objectives of global conventions, such as the conservations on biodiversity and wetland protection [3].
There are many management challenges associated with global forest health. Conversion of forest land to commercial usage, constructions, etc. will not only decrease the forest health but also leads to extinction of many biodiversity’s. In terms of accounting systems for forest yields, global accounts of forest production are based on national reports and contain substantial gaps, particularly in respect to non-timber resources. So, there is no accurate measurement or number to count the number of trees lost. First step in addressing forest deforestation is to monitor and report changes in forest cover in areas that are reserved for forest in the country [4]. Manual labour checking of the land area is time consuming and never ending. In order to overcome this challenge high resolution satellite imaging are utilized. Once again, the manual labour is recurring and tiresome [5].  Use of machine learning methods has emerged in recent days to predict accurately how much of the land has undergone deforestation over the years. utilizing mathematical models and training the systems will result in automatic detection and less human labour for detecting the large amount of satellite data [6]. 
Tarazona, Yonatan, et al focuses on mapping tropical deforestation using time series and machine learning algorithms and were able to classify forest, cropland, bare soil, and water with more than 90% accuracy [7].  Large areas under deforestation and degradation threat, and location of suitable areas for regeneration were predicted by Grinand, Clovis, et al. through machine learning algorithms combined with high-resolution data sets to provide simultaneous and spatial forecasts of deforestation, land degradation, and regeneration for the next two decades [8]. Bavaghar et al. utilised logistic regression on satellite imagery data to estimate the location and extent of deforestation which achieved 75% accuracy [9]. Hyandye et al. used multinomial logistic regression to determine how land use/land cover class in Tanzania was influenced by a set of variables. The authors used the multinomial model, run on Landsat of data across multiple years, to obtain the probable change in land use/land cover.[10]. Szuste et al. [11] used Support Vector Machines for land use and land cover classification in tropical coastal zones achieved decent results.
Kavzoglu and Mather [12] used artificial neural networks to identify land use/land cover for remote sensing data in England, and provide a set of guidelines for practitioners for designing and using artificial neural networks in remote sensing image classification. Some examples of classification using neural networks for remote sensing data are provided by Srivastava et al. [14], Shao and Lunetta [13], and Wang et al. [15]. Kong et al.  [16] apply a long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network to predict forest fire based on a time series of Modis satellite images. They have used a composite time series instead of a single-pixel time series and examined changes to detect fire events. Convolutional neural networks have been successfully applied on multimedia approaches and used to create a system able to handle the classification without any human’s interactions. In [17], for satellite image classification that are based on deep learning convolutional neural network for features extraction used AlexNet, VGG19, GoogLeNet and Resnet50 pretraining models.  Akshay, S., et al, proposed a system for satellite image processing that detects unused land. Here remote sensing earth images are taken as the dataset where the pre-processing step includes converting image into greyscale image, compression and noise removal. Segmentation is done to partition the region of used and unused lands. Random forest is used to segregate two landscapes as used and unused land which gives accuracy better than the existing systems [18]. In the work for recognition in high-resolution, multi-spectral satellite imagery, Pritt, Mark, and Gary Chern [19] have described a deep learning system for classifying objects and facilities from the IARPA Functional Map of the World (fMoW) dataset into 63 different classes. The system consists of an ensemble of convolutional neural networks and additional neural networks that integrate satellite metadata with image features.
The proposed work addresses the detection of the forest cover areas as an important and holistic studies related to ongoing forest cover changes. The outline of the proposed work is shown in Fig.1 It consists of following steps. Preparing Input images acquired from the datasets. In this step the image is acquired, Pre-processed and augmented. Defined two classes for prediction, i.e. 0 is for “No Deforestation happened” and 1 is for “Deforestation”. Labelled the images accordingly and passed it to the pre-trained models for training the models. Pre-trained weights help to overcome the overfitting of the model with a smaller number of datasets. Feature extraction and classification using AlexNet, ResNet18 and DenseNet121 was done individually and all the results were ensembled. We have used Sentinel-2 datasets that is publicly available in Kaggle. 500 original images were used and four different data augmentation techniques were applied to generate more images. A total of 2500 images were utilized to train the models. Data was split into 80% training datasets and 20% validation datasets. 200 separate test sets were taken to verify the test accuracies.
In this proposed approach, all models used Adam optimizer with decreasing learning rate after every 10 epochs. All the graphs were plotted in TensorBoard. The training accuracies are shown in Fig2(a) and losses are shown in Fig 2(b).
After analysing the obtaining of the predictions of all three models, we combined the results of 3 models: AlexNet, ResNet18 and DenseNet121, and predicted the class which was most frequently predicted by all the models. This combined by the proposed Grid searched weighted average ensemble model gave the remarkable best performance and achieved a test accuracy of 90.12% and sensitivity of 95.06%.

rayyan-220235210,Semi-automated Design of Artificial Intelligence Earth Systems Models,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Prediction and observation of water cycles at various scales involve not only patterns isolated in space and time, but also modeling of complex spatio-temporal relationships across multiple domains. For instance, evapotranspiration (ET) and leaf area indexes (LAI) are two parameters that are needed to accurately model and understand land-atmosphere processes. Accurate assessments of ET and LAI are critical for understanding hydrological processes, deforestation, crop yield, and irrigation impacts. However, ET estimates for global simulations are available at very coarse spatial resolution. They are usually derived from satellite data based on broad plant functional types (PFTs), which fail to capture fine-scale variations because of changes in vegetation type across the globe. Similarly LAI estimates have typically been derived from vegetation indices at global scales or estimated locally using physical models, both of which suffer from a range of uncertainties that impact model sensitivity. The new era of AI model development for Earth systems (ES) calls for data-driven methods that provide domain scientists with uncertainty-aware estimations of biophysical parameters such as ET and LAI in a generalizable, interpretable, and discoverable manner.","",https://doi.org/10.2172/1769777,"",,

Therefore, the agriculture industry has been challenged in its processes and products, resulting in a surge of application of novel technologies and practices to maintain itself sustainable. Despite that, this industry is still responsible for 37% of the worldwide workforce, consumes 34% of the global arable land, utilizes 70% of the total water, and emits up to 30% of greenhouse gases (GHG). Progressively widespread in the sector, smart farming is a high-tech, efficient, and sustainable approach achieved by applying integrated technologies within the agricultural value chain processes. It includes increasing feed and food production and decreasing of their waste, prediction of diseases, better estimation of product yields ahead of time, determination of the best harvest time, monitoring of plants-growth cycles, etc. The results are going to yield a sustainable use of soil and water resources while maintaining the green landscape and biodiversity of nature. Emerging remote-sensing technologies and artificial intelligence applications have become essential tools to address these challenges. Drones, also known as Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are among the most promising industry 4.0 (I4) applications for the next generation of agriculture. This paper is a forehead into applications of drones from the innovation economy's standpoint as a viable tool and an effective manpower replacement in the agro-industry. In such a field, artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to be the engine for automation of processes to be integrated into cyber-physical systems and enhanced modeling towards improved agriculture, more efficiently than the previous stages of the applications of technologies in this sector. Agricultural communities and businesses must take a strategic approach for continuous improvement production processes by implementing quicker, safer, and cheaper plans through data analytics and farming as a service (FaaS).","",https://doi.org/10.1109/esmarta52612.2021.9515736,"",,

Therefore, the present study aims at (i) using the Landsat imagery to prepare land use- cover (LULC) maps for 2000 and 2014; (ii) assessing Land use changes on the basis of land change modeler (LCM) for the period from 2000 and 2014, and (iii) predicting the plausible land cover pattern in the region of Behbahan using an algorithm based on ANN for 2028.
Design/methodology/approach- Hybrid model consisting of neural network model, Markov chain (MC), and cellular automata (CA Markov) were designed to improve the performance of the standard network model. The modeling of transfer power is done by multilayer Perceptron of artificial neural network and six variables. The change allocated to each use and the forecasting is computed by Markov chain and CA Markov. Operation model calibration and verification of land use data at two points, was conducted in 2000 and 2014
Finding- Modeling results indicate that the model validation phase, has a good ability to predict land use change on the horizon is 14 years old (2028). The comparison between modeling map and map related to 2013 show that residential area and agricultural land continue to their own growth trend so that residential area will be increased from 3157 hectares in 2014 to 4180 hectares in 2028 and it has 2% growth that this level of growth has been 2% from 2000 to 2014.

The current agricultural problems include timely estimation of crop yield, detection of crop disease, and assessment of damages due to natural disasters such as flood, drought, etc. Any proposed solution to these problems will require accurate classification of crops. In this perspective, UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) data are proving to be crucial in providing images of the land surface in multispectral channels such as blue (B), green (G), red (R), near infrared, red edge and long wave infrared thermal bands. Once the UAV images have been obtained, segmentation and classification of crops can be performed using deep learning techniques. The objectives of this work is to apply U-Net convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture to (i) find the best combination of input spectral bands for various crop classification such as wheat, cotton, maize, grass, and soil, (ii) to analyse the role of including vegetation indices (NDVI and EVI) in crop classification, and (iii) to analyse the role of textural parameters in performing semantic segmentation of the multiple crops in the scene. Average accuracy of the trained model was 83.35% with RGB bands and 74.61% with CIR (Colour Infrared) composite images. Results indicated that inclusion of NDVI in CIR input dataset yield high segmentation accuracy of 83.85% while dealing with the five classes' separation problem.","",https://doi.org/10.1109/ingarss51564.2021.9792009,"",,

This chapter provides an insight into the relevance of memory effects in the Earth system and presents an experimental case study to use an Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model to emulate a physical model. In addition to introducing an experimental design suitable for such purposes, we demonstrate that an RNN is largely capable of learning the memory effects encoded in a physical model. A non-temporal fully connected model cannot reproduce such memory effects, especially during anomalous conditions (e.g. climate extremes).

Hence, efforts to accurate land use and land cover (LULC) monitoring in this region are strategic, due to its role in Brazil's food, environmental, and economic security policy. Thinking on planning and technical sovereignty in the spatial sector, the China–Brazil Earth Resources Satellite (CBERS) Program was launched to provide useful data for decision-makers to manage the Brazilian territory independently of external policies. Their data, especially from CBERS-4 Wide-Field Imager (CBERS-4/WFI), are largely applied in deforestation monitoring by remote sensing specialists but less applied than data from other image providers for machine learning-based LULC mapping due to the small number of spectral bands and limitations related to clouds and shadows detection. However, with advances in orbital data analysis, data cubes enabled storing and accessing large spatio-temporal analysis-ready data. Within this scope, the Brazil Data Cube Project (BDC) creates multidimensional data cubes from orbital sensors' data for all Brazilian territory. We applied BDC CBERS-4/WFI data cubes to generate LULC classifications for the Extremo Oeste Baiano agricultural belt correspondent to the 2017/2018 and 2019/2020 harvest periods, at two levels of detail: broad and crop type, incorporating ground truth samples, crop calendar knowledge, and vegetation indices to a dense time series analysis approach. Overall Accuracies were equal to 0.87 and 0.89 for broad, and 0.91 and 0.94 for crop type classifications.

rural and largely nomadic region into a hub of irrigated agriculture. In 2010 Mohamed
Bouazizi sparked the Tunisian revolution by lighting himself on fire int he city of Sidi
Bouzid, with some blaming the inequality and water scarcity created by this rapid expansion in the irrigation farming as an important cause (Bayat, 2017; Malka, 2018). Sweden
has aided in this development from 1972-1992, and as part of an evaluation project by
Martensson et al (2019) a change detection analysis of the area around the Jabal al Kbar
mountain was requested.
In this thesis two different object based classification methods (supervised random forest
on a segmented image and unsupervised ISODATA on a segmented image) were tested to
map and detect land use changes in a semi-arid environment in 4 areas around the Jabal
al Kbar over the years 1972 to 2021 based on 30m and 60m LANDSAT imagery in 10-year
intervals. Random Forest proved to have the highest accuracy of the two methods tested,
with a total accuracy of 72% and Cohen’s κ of 0.57 in a 60m resolution scene and 73% and
κ of 0.54 for a 30m resolution scene. ISODATA was not deemed adequate as it produced
too few classes with a standard number of iterations to be useful. A map produced with
a low number of iterations had an accuracy of only 51% and κ of 0.13. The resolution
was a limiting factor as it made identification of features difficult in the sampling process.
Nevertheless, the historic development of the study area from the literature in terms of
irrigation development and urbanization could be detected using Random Forest. Most
notably a rapid development in irrigation farming from 2004 to today in the area Hichria
was detected as well as decrease in the same period of irrigated area in the Sidi Bouzid
depression. for all 4 areas, starting trends observed from 2004 to to 2011 continued into
2021, thus not showing any noticeable effect of the revolution in the development.","",,"",,

In the present work, the land change model for Greece, a typical Mediterranean country, has been developed, based on historical information from remotely sensed land cover data. Land cover types based on the International Geosphere-Biosphere Program (IGBP) classification were obtained from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) land cover product, i.e. MCD12Q1, provided annually from 2001 to 2018 at a spatial resolution of 500 m. Initially, the dominant land cover changes and their driving variables for the decade of 2001 to 2011 were determined and the transition potential of land was mapped using a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural network. Four dominant land-cover transformations were found in Greece from 2001 to 2011, i.e. land transformation from Savannas to Woody Savannas, from Savannas to Grasslands, from Grasslands to Savannas, and from Croplands to Grasslands. Driving variables were found to be the Evidence Likelihood of Land Cover, i.e. the relative frequency with which different land cover categories occurred within the areas that transitioned, the Altitude as realized in the Digital Elevation Model of Greece from ASTER GDEM, the Distance from previously changed land and two climate variables i.e. Mean Annual Precipitation and Mean Annual Minimum Temperature. After the model was calibrated, its predictive ability was tested for land cover prediction for 2018 and was found to be 96.7%. Future land cover projections up to 2030 were developed incorporating CMIP6 climate data under two Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs), i.e SSP126 corresponding to a sustainable future and SSP585, which describes the future world based on fossil-fueled development. The results indicate that major historical land transformations in Greece, do not correspond to land degradation or desertification, as it has been reported in previous works. On the contrary, the land cover transitions indicate that the Woody Savannas gain areas constantly, whereas Grasslands and Croplands lose areas, and forested areas of all types demonstrate moderate gains. Concerning future land cover, the present work indicates that the direction of historical changes will also prevail in the next decade, with the most severe scenario, i.e. SSP585 slowing down the rate of changes and the most sustainable one, i.e. SSP126, accelerating the rate of expansion of woody vegetation land cover type.","",https://doi.org/10.1080/15481603.2021.1885235,"",,

While traditional in situ or aerial campaigns for forest assessments provide accurate data for analysis at regional level, scaling them to entire countries and beyond with high temporal resolution is hardly possible. In this work, we propose a Bayesian deep learning approach to densely estimate forest structure variables at country-scale with 10-meter resolution, using freely available satellite imagery as input. Our method jointly transforms Sentinel-2 optical images and Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar images into maps of five different forest structure variables: 95th height percentile, mean height, density, Gini coefficient, and fractional cover. We train and test our model on reference data from 41 airborne laser scanning missions across Norway and demonstrate that it is able to generalize to unseen test regions, achieving normalized mean absolute errors between 11% and 15%, depending on the variable. Our work is also the first to propose a Bayesian deep learning approach so as to predict forest structure variables with well-calibrated uncertainty estimates. These increase the trustworthiness of the model and its suitability for downstream tasks that require reliable confidence estimates, such as informed decision making. We present an extensive set of experiments to validate the accuracy of the predicted maps as well as the quality of the predicted uncertainties. To demonstrate scalability, we provide Norway-wide maps for the five forest structure variables.","",,"",,

When such models become more robust and used in real-life applications, they might help decision makers and early responders to choose the best actions to sustain the wellbeing of society, natural resources and biodiversity.

Jiaozhou Bay is the largest bay-type coastal wetland with high biodiversity in Shandong Peninsula. In recent years, the wetland of Jiaozhou Bay has been reduced dramatically due to urban expansion. It is significant to study the characteristics and causes of the wetland changes in the past 40 years for the rational exploitation and sustainable development of coastal wetland resources. The types, spatial distribution, and area information of the wetland from 1983 to 2019 are obtained by artificial visual interpretation and supervised classification using ten Landsat remote sensing images, assisted by Google images. The research analyzes the conversion of land use types and the change rule of landscape pattern in the wetland, as well as the driving forces of the wetland evolution and the uncertainty factors affecting the analysis results. The results indicate that the wetland area shows an overall decreasing trend from 1983 to 2019, 77% of which are converted into nonwetland. The wetland area increases initially, followed by a decrease from 1990 to 2000, but then continues to decrease slowly from 2000 to 2019. There are many types of land use changes from coastal tidal flats to other land use types such as construction land or pond, and the landscape pattern has been gradually fragmented. The continuous increase in temperature is the main natural cause for the degradation of the wetland. Population factor is the most important driving force for the change of the wetland. The main uncertain factors affecting the analysis results are the capture time of remote sensing image, tidal level correction, wetland classification system, and method. The results provide a basis for the decision-making of wetland protection. The quantitative data will provide a reference for the construction of a multiyear wetland dataset in Jiaozhou Bay.","",https://doi.org/10.2112/jcoastres-d-21-00075.1,"",,

Traditional climate and hydrologic models rely on the numerical simulation of detailed physical processes. Therefore, running these simulations is time-, labor-, and computation-intensive. Improving the spatial and temporal resolution in these modeling outputs could lead to cubic increases in both the simulation time and computational demands, rendering high-resolution hydrometeorological predictions expensive and impractical. Many past studies apply the super resolution (SR) technique to downscale climate models using deep learners. However, deep learners are deemed “black-boxes,” as their derivation processes from low-resolution outputs to high-resolution outputs are often hidden. Their results are difficult for domain scientists to interpret and validate. Thus, there is a need for an exploratory machine learning approach that can partially integrate domain-specific theory and knowledge into the data-driven mapping process between simulation outputs of different spatial scales. The domain-specific theory and knowledge can be incorporated into the data model through an inductive approach in which process-related environmental variables are used and analyzed as key drivers (i.e., environmental surrogates) to reflect the complex physical processes. Many of these variables, such as land use land cover, soil types, topography, digital elevation, air temperature, and various watershed characteristics, can be directly measured through sensors or remote sensing techniques. Additionally, SR applications that can downscale hydrological and hydrodynamics models to efficiently produce high-resolution (1 m) flood depth grids are still rare. Since the flood depth grid can be used to support critical decisions for flood control operation at hydroelectric power plants, it is crucial to enable an SR-based capability for interpolating high-resolution flood inundation maps.","",https://doi.org/10.2172/1769644,"",,
rayyan-220235782,Artificial Intelligence and machine learning model for spatial and temporal prediction of drought in the Colombia Caribbean region.,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Drought is one of the most critical hydrometeorological phenomena in terms of impacts to society because it affects soil water content, and consequently, crop production and human diets, in some cases under critical conditions, drought produces starving and people migration. Although Colombia is a tropical country, there are areas of the territory that have periods of drought that cause important economic damages such as fires, death loss in cattle, reduction of the capacity to supply water to persons, impacts to agriculture and fish farming.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Due to recent advances in terms of spatial and temporal resolutions of remote sensing and Artificial Intelligence techniques, it is possible to develop Automatic Learning Models supported on historic information. In this research was built a classifier&amp;amp;#160; Random Forest (RF) and Bagged Decision Tree Classifier (DTC) model to predict, spatial and temporal drought occurrence in Colombia, using remote sensing data as land surface temperature, precipitation, soil water contentl, and evapotranspiration, and macro climatic variables information as ONI, MEI and SOI.&amp;amp;#160; It was used the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) with 3-month time scale, that allows identifying agricultural drought events. The results showed that Random Forest provides the best outcomes. In terms of recall and precision, RF produced 0.84 and 0.59 and DTC brought a 0.8 and 0.33, respectively, to predict drought. The above, evidence that models could overestimate the number of times where drought occurs, in contrast with normal or humid conditions. On the other hand, False Positive and False Negative rates are important facts for measuring the development of models. In this case, the FP and FN rates are 7.5% and 2% for RF and 21% and 2.5% for DTC respectively, that means that both models made fewer mistakes predicted real drought events, but had more errors forecasting real normal or humid condition, especially, DTC model. RF can provide a better performance predicting drought and normal/humid conditions in contrast with DTC. The implementation of the developed model can allow governmental entities assessment and monitor agricultural drought over time.

Different proxy variables indicating species richness and quality of the sites are essential for efficient detecting and monitoring forest biodiversity. European aspen (Populus tremula L.) is a minor deciduous tree species with a high importance in maintaining biodiversity in boreal forests. Large aspen trees host hundreds of species, many of them classified as threatened. However, accurate fine-scale spatial data on aspen occurrence remains scarce and incomprehensive.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#160;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We studied detection of aspen using different remote sensing techniques in Evo, southern Finland.

We collected high-resolution airborne hyperspectral and airborne laser scanning data covering the whole study area and ultra-high resolution unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) data with RGB and multispectral sensors from selected parts of the area.

Both climate modeling and remote sensing have limitations, particularly in the most crucial areas with intense surface melt.&amp;amp;#160; The motivation of our study is to investigate the opportunities and challenges in improving the accuracy of surface melt estimation using a deep neural network. The trained deep neural network uses meteorological observations from automatic weather stations (AWS) and surface albedo observations from satellite imagery to improve surface melt simulations from the regional atmospheric climate model version 2.3p2 (RACMO2). Based on observations from three AWS at the Larsen B and C Ice Shelves, cross-validation shows a high accuracy (root mean square error = 0.898 mm.w.e.d&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#8722;1&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;, mean absolute error = 0.429 mm.w.e.d&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#8722;1&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;, and coefficient of determination = 0.958). The deep neural network also outperforms conventional machine learning models (e.g., random forest regression, XGBoost) and a shallow neural network. To compute surface melt for the entire Larsen Ice Shelf, the deep neural network is applied to RACMO2 simulations. The resulting, corrected surface melt shows a better correlation with the AWS observations in AWS 14 and 17, but not in AWS 18. Also, the spatial pattern of the surface melt is improved compared to the original RACMO2 simulation. A possible explanation for the mismatch at AWS 18 is its complex geophysical setting. Even though our study shows an opportunity to improve surface melt simulations using a deep neural network, further study is needed to refine the method, especially for complicated, heterogeneous terrain.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu21-908,"",,

Today, numerical weather models are able to forecast weather patterns on a scale of several kilometers. However, the extreme weather impacts materialize at a finer scale, interacting with highly local factors such as topography, soil or vegetation type. The relationship between driving variables and Earth&amp;amp;#8217;s surface at such local scales remains unresolved by current physical models and is partly unknown; hence, it is a source of considerable uncertainty. Most current efforts to predict the local impacts of extreme weather rely on weather downscaling as an intermediary step. However, weather impacts at high resolution are observed and analyzed on satellite imagery. Thus, we can bypass the weather downscaling step by directly forecasting satellite imagery. This is inherently similar to video prediction, a computer vision task that has been tackled with machine learning models. Here we introduce EarthNet2021, a machine learning challenge to forecast the spatio-temporal evolution of the Earth&amp;amp;#8217;s terrestrial surface. The task can be summarized as translating coarse weather projections into high-resolution Earth surface imagery encompassing localized climate impacts. EarthNet2021 is a carefully prepared dataset containing target spatio-temporal Sentinel-2 imagery at 20 m resolution, matching with high resolution topography and mesoscale (1.28 km) weather variables. Comparing multiple Earth surface forecasts is not trivial. Thus, we design the EarthNetScore, a novel ranking criterion for Earth surface models. EarthNet2021 comes with multiple test tracks for evaluation of model validity and robustness as well as model applicability to extreme events and the complete annual vegetation cycle. In addition to forecasting directly observable weather impacts through satellite-derived vegetation indices, capable Earth surface models will enable downstream applications such as crop yield prediction, forest health assessments, coastline management or biodiversity monitoring.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu21-1612,"",,

rayyan-220235937,Irrigation in JULES Land-Only Simulations over South and East Asia,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Capturing soil moisture-atmosphere feedbacks in a weather or climate model requires realistic simulation of various land surface processes. However, irrigation and other water management methods are still missing in most global climate models today, despite irrigated agriculture being the dominant land use in parts of Asia. In this study, we test the irrigation scheme available in the land model JULES (Joint UK Land Environment Simulator) by running land-only simulations over South and East Asia driven by WFDEI (WATCH Forcing Data ERA-Interim) forcing data. Irrigation in JULES is applied on a daily basis by replenishing soil moisture in the upper soil layers to field capacity, and we use a version of the irrigation scheme that extracts water for irrigation from groundwater and rivers, which physically limits the amount of irrigation that can be applied. We prescribe irrigation for C3 grasses in order to simulate the effects of agriculture, albeit retaining the simpler, widely used 5-PFT (plant functional type) configuration in JULES. Irrigation generally increases soil moisture and evapotranspiration, which results in increasing latent heat fluxes and decreasing sensible heat fluxes. Comparison with combined observational/machine-learning products for turbulent fluxes shows that while irrigation can reduce biases, other biases in JULES, unrelated to irrigation, are larger than improvements due to the inclusion of irrigation. Irrigation also affects water fluxes within the soil, e.g. runoff and drainage into the groundwater level, as well as soil moisture outside of the irrigation season. We find that the irrigation scheme, at least in the uncoupled land-atmosphere setting, can rapidly deplete groundwater to the point that river flow becomes the main source of irrigation (over the North China Plain and the Indus region) and can have the counterintuitive effect of decreasing annual average soil moisture (over the Ganges plain). Subsequently, we will explore the impact of irrigation on regional climate by conducting coupled land-atmosphere simulations.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu21-12213,"",,

Current land management challenges, including conserving rare species and habitats, illustrate a growing need for spatially extensive and rapidly updatable biodiversity information; a need that can best be met through remotely sensed imagery combined with the remarkable data processing potential of machine learning. We assess the potential for optical satellite data to classify complex upland habitat types in the Scottish Highlands, following two UK national habitat classification frameworks. We explore how the differences in spatial and spectral resolution of satellite sensors affects the accuracy of derived habitat maps. Specifically, we contrast the performance of open-source Sentinel-2 data (20 m spatial resolution) against higher spatial-resolution data from the commercial Worldview-2 satellite (0.5 m resolution). We then compare the results produced with these satellite datasets against equivalent results obtained with high-resolution (25 cm) colour airborne photographs, to better inform users on the utility of available optical data before subsequent analysis, e.g. natural capital assessments, in comparable settings. We demonstrate that high-fidelity habitat maps (93% overall accuracy) can be produced using high resolution optical satellite data (Worldview-2). This level of accuracy exceeded that of maps derived from airborne surveys (~75%) and is deemed sufficient to be useful to ecologists in-situ. In contrast, the capacity of Sentinel-2 data was considerably more limited (~50% overall accuracy). This highlights the importance of spatial resolution for characterising habitat mosaics at scale, especially in settings such as upland Scotland where shifts in habitat and species composition of importance to land managers may occur at relatively fine length scales (<10m).

Despite harbouring 18 percentage of the global population, India only accounts for 4 percentage of the world’s water resources. Although India has made improvements over the past decades to both the availability and quality of municipal drinking water systems, its large population has stressed planned water resources and rural areas are left out. India is also a major grain producer with a great need for water to support the commodity. As with all countries with large agricultural output, excess water consumption for food production depletes the overall water table. Also, regardless of improvements to drinking water, many other water sources are contaminated with both bio and chemical pollutants, and over 21 percentage of the country’s diseases are water-related. Other concern is that India may lack overall long term availability of replenishable water resources. India’s water crisis is often the result of a lack of government planning, limited business closure, industrial and human pollution, and government corruption. In addition, India’s water shortage is expected to increase as population growth is expected to rise to 1.6 billion by 2050. Niti Aayog estimates that around 100 Million Indians are expected to run out of water by 2030. To that end, global water scarcity is expected to become a leading cause of national political conflict in the future, and the prognosis for India is no different. In such scenario rain-water harvesting and desalination becomes inevitable. On a positive note, some areas of India are fortunate to have a relatively wet climate, even in the most arid regions. However, with no rain catchment programs in place, most of the water is displaced or dried up instead of used. In these areas, rain harvesting could be one solution for water collection. Collected water can be immediately used for agriculture, and with improved filtration practices to reduce water-borne pathogens, also quickly available for human consumption. Whatever the means, India needs solution. Children in 100 million homes in the country lack water, and one out of every two children are malnourished.

Science challenges: How do we maximally leverage big-data observations to improve hydrobiogeochemical process description and parameterization so that such modules more realistically capture hydrologic and vegetation responses and feedbacks under the future climate? For example, how can we leverage physics, limited observations of vegetation and streamflow to better estimate evapotranspiration, and, relatedly, net primary productivity, especially for drought areas? Vegetation plays a critical role in regional and global water cycles; however, existing vegetation models have failed to predict vegetation response to droughts (McDowell & Xu, 2017) , arctic greening (Keenan & Riley, 2018) , and critical transitions between forest and savanna (Hirota et al., 2011) . These studies suggest that when we build process-based models (PBM) parameterized from regional and global plant traits, we tend to poorly describe plant adaptation and local-scale competition processes. The models and their associated parameters assigned for different regions in the world are not capturing essential heterogeneity in vegetation responses at finer spatial scales. Many parameters of the land surface models control hydrology and vegetation dynamics at the same time. The heterogeneity in vegetation response is a function of (i) plant type, (ii) plant size, (iii) competition and succession, (iv) environmental controls, and (v) local variations due to the unique ecological community that are very difficult to describe (e.g., the size of gaps resulting from fire that facilitated the coexistence of pioneering species). In the demographic models, only factors (i) and (iv) were captured, and plant types were generally described only by leaf phenology and climate zones. With current demographic models, we generally consider more traits to define plant types (i) and calibrate these traits to consider factors (ii), (iii) and (iv); however, it is substantially challenging to scale to regional and global simulations due to trait variations across space (Ali et al., 2016). Moreover, it has been noted that hillslope processes, including ridge-to-valley flow and sunny vs. shady slopes are primary organizers of water, energy, and vegetation (Clark et al., 2015; Fan et al., 2019) . Although gradual improvements in the hydrologic model component in earth system models may reduce this error (at a remarkably slow pace), the long-term, gradual impact of hydrology on plant traits are not well captured. Recent work showed that the hydrologic controls exerted by groundwater and lateral flow are primary regulators of rooting depth (Fan et al., 2017) . Such hydrologic controls have seldom been reflected in vegetation model parameterizations.","",https://doi.org/10.2172/1769724,"",,

Next, within the error limits of the results for the 2017 neural network area prediction and the space center of gravity for each land type, we predicted the land-use changes for 2017 and determined the final land type for all grid units based on the set evolution rules and land conversion threshold. Finally, the land-use prediction simulation map for 2017 and actual land-use conditions were verified for quantitative and spatial accuracy. The results reveal that the model simulated the land-use changes for Yucheng District relatively accurately. It was also found that selecting the appropriate thresholds and random variable parameters improved the model's simulation accuracy and that the land use in the study area exhibits a clear urbanization trend.","",https://doi.org/10.1061/(asce)up.1943-5444.0000905,"",,

We evaluate past uses of radar, multispectral, and LiDAR datasets in Northwest Belize across well-studied wetland field complexes that occur under different vegetation conditions. Next, we compare topographic products derived from LiDAR data commonly used for archaeology and geomorphology. Lastly, we train a machine learning algorithm to detect ancient canals with LiDAR data and test the algorithm on a newly rediscovered field system. The spatial resolution of any dataset must be sufficiently high (2-m or finer resolution) to detect most of these canals reliably. High resolution multispectral sensors can detect canals in open areas, but most wetland complexes are under dense tropical forest impenetrable to multispectral instruments. LiDAR data were the most useful due to the high spatial resolution (0.5-m) and the ability to penetrate canopy, but still have limitations under certain conditions. The intensity of the LiDAR returns with multispectral LiDAR systems can reveal differences in soil and vegetation between ancient canals and fields in places leveled by modern farmers. The algorithm successfully maps ancient canals but has many false positives in natural depressions and drainages. Although the machine learning approach tested here cannot be used on its own, we used it with the LiDAR visualizations to refine the canal estimates from previous studies, mapping nearly 50% more canals in the Central Rio Bravo floodplain than originally published.","",https://doi.org/10.1177/03091333221134185,"",,

However, traditional species distribution models cannot detect rapid, local plant species changes due to their low spatial and temporal resolution 3,4 , and remote sensing models can only identify changes in coarse vegetation categories 5,6 . Here we combine open-access remote sensing imagery, citizen science observations, and deep learning to create a multi-species prediction model at high spatial and temporal resolution. We train a novel deep convolutional neural network using ∼half a million observations within California to simultaneously predict the presence of over 2,000 plant species at meter-level resolution. This model— deepbiosphere —accurately performs many key biodiversity monitoring tasks, from fine-mapping geographic distributions of individual species and communities, to detecting rapid plant community changes in space and time.

They are a recurrent, creeping meteorological hazard that may endanger the water and food security of large regions. The frequency and severity of droughts are expected to increase with climate change, especially in Africa, Central America, and also in Europe where annual losses may multiply by 7 and represent up to 2 times the size of the European economy in the medium-long term.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Drought Early Warning Systems (DEWS) are key pillars of a risk-based, proactive management strategy. The increasing number of sources of EO data has remarkedly improved the monitoring capabilities of DEWS. Despite there are good examples of global and regional drought monitoring systems, these tools still lack of seasonal forecasting capabilities able to provide enough accurate and specific predictions of drought impacts at the subregion level (e.g. basin, district). These deficiencies constitute a challenge for the scientific community and provide an opportunity to improve the current services.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;To address this gap in the DEWS landscape, the InfoSequia DEWS is developed to integrate the strengths of spatial, satellite-derived data with machine learning techniques for seasonal forecasting.

The present study focused on estimating the current situation and simulating the future LST patterns in Lahore using remote sensing data and machine learning models. The semi-automated classification model was applied for the estimation of LST from 2000 to 2020. Then, the cellular automata-artificial neural networks (CA-ANN) module was implemented to predict future LST patterns for 2030 and 2040, respectively. Our research findings revealed that an average of 2.8 °C of land surface temperature has increased, with a mean LST value from 37.25 °C to 40.10 °C in Lahore during the last two decades from 2000 to 2020. Moreover, keeping CA-ANN simulations for land surface temperature, an increase of 2.2 °C is projected through 2040, and mean LST values will be increased from 40.1 °C to 42.31 °C by 2040. The CA-ANN model was validated for future LST simulation with an overall Kappa value of 0.82 and 86.2% of correctness for the years 2030 and 2040 using modules for land-use change evaluation. The study also indicates that land surface temperature is an important factor in environmental changes. Therefore, it is suggested that future urban planning should focus on urban rooftop plantations and vegetation conservation to minimize land surface temperature increases in Lahore.","",https://doi.org/10.14358/pers.22-00071r2,"",,

While multiple satellite types provide data to monitor surface temperature, geostationary (GEO) sensors provide near-continuous, continental-scale observations which can better capture the diurnal variability of land surface temperature (LST) than intermittent observations from low-earth orbit (LEO) sensors. However, standard products from GEO satellites are available at coarsened spatial and temporal resolutions compared to the native sensor resolution. Using datasets from the NASA Earth Exchange, we leveraged co-located, co-temporal observations from LEO and GEO satellites to learn a data-driven mapping using a convolutional neural network. The resulting NASA Earth eXchange Artificial Intelligence LST (NEXAI-LST) achieved a mean absolute error of 1.73 K relative to the target LEO product and improves on both spatial and temporal resolution [2 km, 10 minute] compared to the GEO full disk standard product [10 km, hourly]. In validation against measurements from a ground-based sensor network, NEXAI-LST achieves similar or better fit than both LEO and GEO standard products, while depending none of the prior knowledge of land surface and atmospheric states required by physical-statistical models. Further, application of the model to unseen LEO and GEO satellites demonstrates robust generalization of the model across spatial region, time of day, and sensor. In support of NASA's open-source science initiative, we make our NEXAI-LST product, model, and codes available to facilitate data exploration and further studies.","",https://doi.org/10.1109/access.2022.3198673,"",,
rayyan-220236590,Analysis of Agricultural Toolset based on Artificial Intelligence,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"One of the industries that are most crucial to humanity is agriculture. Agriculture mechanization is the major issue facing all countries today. As the world's population is expanding at an incredibly fast rate, there is an increasing demand for food. To fulfill the expanding demand, farmers will need to apply chemical pesticides more often than they already do. The soil is harmed by this. The land continues to be unproductive and barren as a result of this having a substantial influence on agricultural activities. Several mechanization strategies, including deep learning, machine learning, and artificial intelligence, are covered in this article. It is crucial to use new technologies at various stages of the agro-based supply chain due to several long-term challenges for the agricultural industry and various factors, such as population growth, global warming, technological advancement, and the condition of environmental assets (water, etc.). Examples include automated farm equipment processes, the use of sensing devices and satellite data for distant locations, artificial intelligence, and machine learning for forecasting weather patterns. Crop diseases, inadequate storage management, chemical usage, weed control, insufficient irrigation, and poor water management are just a few problems the agricultural sector is facing. Using the range of strategies covered, each of these problems might be handled. It has been demonstrated that automating farming procedures increases soil productivity and improves soil fertility. To get a quick overview of how automation is currently being used in agriculture, this paper examines the work of numerous researchers. In the current study, we highlight the key uses of AI and Ml techniques in farming and highlight the undeniably rising trend in the implementation of these techniques to advance the agriculture sector.","",https://doi.org/10.1109/smart55829.2022.10047391,"",,

As a result, farmers rely on accurate weather forecasts to run their businesses. Agriculture is interwoven with other industries, including the sugar industry, which relies on sugarcane farmers. They may be able to better organise their logistics by employing machine learning or artificial intelligence to estimate agricultural production. As a result, both AI and connected IoT devices have a lot of potential in agriculture. When estimating agricultural yields, there are various elements to consider. Weather trends, satellite images, soil quality, and the potential of an infestation are all investigated in this location. When all of these criteria are taken into account, a complete picture of when crops should be planted emerges. In the event that unanticipated problems develop, there are also ""what-if"" scenarios and backup plans in place. Climate change can affect agricultural production in a variety of ways, including changes in average temperatures, precipitation amounts, heat waves, CO2 levels in the air, and ozone levels at ground level. Climate change has a wide range of affects from country to country. Lower-elevation countries are more prone to have difficulties producing crops. Equipment capable of accurately predicting the evolution of weather patterns is required Weather forecasts based on statistics look at previous data to see if there are any patterns between seasons. As a result, the winter data can be used to forecast summer temperatures. Winter temperatures will almost probably alter if summer temperatures change. In the published literature, researchers have detailed their confirmed solutions to various problems. If prior concepts are used without first receiving a qualified review, future researchers will not get the desired results. If the researchers don't first undertake a thorough investigation of the most recent indications of performance, it's likely that they won't be able to find evidence of future growth in the direction of excellence.

The main effect of this must be resolved by detecting and evaluating certain methods to protect the area of the forest. For example, deforestation has become a significant contributor to biodi versity loss and environmental problems. A model which may provide interpretable forecasts of deforestation is a significant tool for preventing the loss of forest area such as unlawful logging and grazing or planting. Advances in the study of satellite data and artificial neural networks have resulted in several ways to develop such a model. This article discusses the most commonly used machine learning methods. The primeval aim of this research is to develop a framework for comparing several evaluation metrics in order to enhance the existing solution and provide interpretable temporal predictions. This means that the image processing technique have tremendous promise for predicting deforestation in forests. The findings of this research will help to improve forest observation and policy initiatives for rehabilitation. This research deals with the vandalur forest area and detects the prediction of how much deforestation has been happened from 2008 to 2021 using satellite images. By comparing various models, the efficacy amongst the most frequently used assessment measures is investigated. The research finding suggests that different model for forecasting degradation may be used, as well as the areas lost throughout the research period. According to the data, 50% of the land cover area was deteriorated between 2008 and 2021. By 2030, it is predicted that 75% of the land cover area would have been damaged by constructions, condominiums, and parks.","",https://doi.org/10.1109/icssit53264.2022.9716492,"",,

Therefore, the present study focused on understanding the spatiotemporal variations of hydroclimatic variables namely rainfall, surface runoff, water yield, and the Aridity Index (AI) of the Krishna River Basin (KRB) under combined impact of climate and Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) change scenarios. From trend analysis, the best model (CNRM-CM5 driven RCM) projected an increasing trend in rainfall under both RCP 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios for the entire century. Results indicated that, except for the central part, most of KRB experiences high runoff and water yield conditions under both RCP 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios in the mid and end centuries, conversely it may face low runoff and water yield conditions in the early century. Most of the central part is in arid and semi-arid conditions and, the eastern part of the basin is in dry sub-humid conditions, while the Western Ghats, Palleru, and Munneru regions of the basin fall under humid and hyper humid regions under RCP 4.5 scenario. Whereas the majority of the basin falls under humid and hyper humid regions under RCP 8.5 scenario except for the central and few other parts of the basin.

These agro-ecosystem services also provide significant economic benefits to people and the socio-economic development of a country. However, the sustainability of agro-ecosystem services is threatened by climate change and variability. Agro-ecosystem models have been recognized as a potential tool to understand the interaction between climate and other components of an agro-ecosystem and identify the best management practices for sustainable management of the system. This chapter presents the application of the agro-ecosystem models to simulate some of the water-regulating agro-ecosystem services under climate change scenarios in India. Simulation models have been successfully applied for the infiltration, groundwater recharge, evapotranspiration, evaporation, runoff, water storage, and soil erosion as the water-regulating agro-ecosystem services. The application of various infiltration models developed in India has effectively been demonstrated for both constant and variable depth of water for a variety of soils. A large variation in potential groundwater recharge both in time and space has been recorded for the soybean [ Glycine max (L.) Merr.] cropping system under different soils using the HYDRUS-1D model. Simulated potential groundwater recharge from water harvesting structures (WHS) by the integrated potential groundwater recharge simulation (IPGRS) model ranged from 83.0 to 90.2% of the accumulated surface runoff in the WHS. Different hydrological models, such as the Precipitation Runoff Modeling Systems (PRMS), and the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) have been applied successfully to various river basins of India for modeling climate change impact on water resources. Simulation of soil erosion—using the revised universal soil loss equation (RUSLE) model under HADCM3 model simulated climate change scenarios under SRES A2 emission scenarios—showed an increase in soil erosion from 58 to 59% for the different land-use systems with an increase of 58% in annual rainfall during the 2080s (2071–2099). Simulation studies conducted on some water-regulating agro-ecosystem services using hydrological models with different climate change projections and downscaling approaches showed varied hydrological responses of land-use systems and river basins in agro-ecosystems of India to the future climate change scenarios. In conclusion, these agro-ecosystem modeling applications tested in the semi-arid region of India can be extended to other agro-ecological regions of the world for better understanding and quantifying water-regulating agro-ecosystem services.

rayyan-220236874,Deep‐learning‐based harmonization and super‐resolution of near‐surface air temperature from CMIP6 models (1850–2100),,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract Future global temperature change will have significant effects on society and ecosystems. Earth system models (ESM) are the primary tools to explore future climate change. However, ESMs have great uncertainty and often run at a coarse spatial resolution (usually about 2°). Accurate high‐spatial‐resolution temperature dataset are needed to improve our understanding of temperature variations and for many other applications. We apply Super resolution (SR) in computer vision using deep learning (DL) to merge 31 ESMs data. The proposed method performs data merging, bias‐correction, and spatial downscaling simultaneously. The CRU TS (Climate Research Unit gridded Time Series) data is used as reference data in the model training process. To find a suitable DL method, we select five SR methodologies with different structures. We compare the performances of the methods based on mean square error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE) and Pearson correlation coefficient ( R ). The best method is used to merge the projected monthly data (1850–1900), and monthly future scenarios data (2015–2100), at the high spatial resolution of 0.5°. Results show that the merged data have considerably improved performance compared with individual ESM data and their ensemble mean (EM), both spatially and temporally. The MAE shows significant improvement; the spatial distribution of the MAE widens along the latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere. The MAE of merged data is ranging from 0.60 to 1.50, the South American (SA) has the lowest error and the Europe has the highest error. The merged product has excellent performance when the observation data is smooth with few fluctuations in the time series. This work demonstrates the applicability and effectiveness of the DL methods in data merging, bias‐correction and spatial downscaling when enough training data are available.

rayyan-220236945,Conservation Status of Forest Types Vary Greatly in Myanmar - the Most Forested Country in the Indo-burma Biodiversity Hotspot,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract Diverse forests with distinct forest types, harbor exceptional biodiversity and provide many ecosystem goods and services, making some forest types more economically valuable and prone to exploitation than others. The high rates of deforestation in Southeast Asia endanger the existence of such vulnerable forest types. Myanmar, the region’s largest forest frontier provides a last opportunity to conserve these vulnerable forest types. However, the exact distribution and spatial extent of Myanmar’s forest types has not been well characterized. To address this research gap, we developed a national scale Forest Type map of Myanmar at 20m resolution, using moderate resolution, multi-sensor satellite images (Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2 and ALOS-PALSAR), extensive field data, and a machine learning model (RandomForest). We mapped nine major forest types and developed a Conservation Status Score to evaluate the conservation status of the mapped forest types. Swamp, Mangrove, Dry Deciduous, Lowland Evergreen and Thorn forests were ranked as the five least conserved forest types. We also identified the largest remaining patch for each of the five least conserved forest types and determined their protection status to inform future forest conservation policy. In most cases, these patches lay outside protected areas indicating areas that may be prioritized for future conservation.","",https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1171476/v1,"",,
rayyan-220236951,"Recent Advances in Deep Learning for Spatio-Temporal Drought Monitoring, Forecasting and Model Understanding",,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Droughts constitute one of the costliest natural hazards and have seriously destructive effects on the ecological environment, agricultural production and socio-economic conditions. Their elusive and subjective definition, due to the complex physical, chemical and biological processes of the Earth system they involve, makes their management an arduous challenge to researchers, as well as decision and policy makers. We present here our most recent advances in machine learning models in three complementary lines of research about droughts: monitoring, forecasting and understanding. While monitoring or detection is about gaining the time series of drought maps and discovering underlying patterns and correlations, forecasting or prediction is to anticipate future droughts. Last but not least, understanding or explaining models by means of expert-comprehensible representations is equally important as accurately addressing these tasks, especially for their deployment in real scenarios. Thanks to the emergence and success of deep learning, all of these tasks can be tackled by the design of spatio-temporal data-driven approaches built on the basis of climate variables (soil moisture, precipitation, temperature, vegetation health, etc.) and/or satellite imagery. The possibilities are endless, from the design of convolutional architectures and attention mechanisms to the use of generative models such as Normalizing Flows (NFs) or Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), trained both in a supervised and unsupervised manner, among others. Different application examples in Europe from 2003 onwards are provided, with the aim of reflecting on the possibilities of the strategies proposed, and also of foreseeing alternatives and future lines of development. For that purpose, we make use of several mesoscale (1&amp;amp;#8201;km) spatial and 8 days temporal resolution variables included in the Earth System Data Cube (ESDC) [Mahecha et al., 2020] for drought detection, while high resolution (20 m, 5 days) Sentinel-2 data cubes, extracted from the extreme summer track in EarthNet2021 [Requena-Mesa et al., 2021], are considered for forecasting.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#160;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;References&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Mahecha, M.

rayyan-220237012,Widening the lens of population-based health research to climate change impacts and adaptation: The Climate and Health Surveillance and Response System (CHES-RS) (Preprint),,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"<sec> <title>BACKGROUND</title> Even though climate change is one of the most significant global health challenges, empirical population-based data on its impacts and adaptation measures to protect population health are still limited. The 56 long-term health cohorts in Africa and Asia, called Health and Demographic Surveillance Systems (HDSSs) are excellent for monitoring climate impact on health and adaptation measures as they: (i) follow quality controlled protocols of data collection across all sites, (ii) provide long-term continuous data, (iii) cover diverse climate hotspots, including coastal areas, rainforests, savannah and highlands, and, (iv) capture about 100-million-person years of data. However, HDSSs have not leveraged their potential for climate and health research and policy, as (i) local meteorological data or remotely sensed data is not incorporated; (ii) there are limited links to downscaled climate impact models for HDSSs; (iii) and at its core, demographic dynamics are captured, with cause of death being the major health indicator tracked over time. </sec> <sec> <title>OBJECTIVE</title> We introduced major improvements in data collection, database architecture, data transmission, as well as links to locally downsized climate models to capitalize on the strong potential of HDSSs sites for measuring health impacts of climate change, identifying particularly vulnerable groups, and testing the costs and effectiveness of adaptation interventions and policies to protect populations from these climate impacts. This bundle of methods called Climate and Health Surveillance and Response System (CHES-RS) aims to provide a consistent set of climate and health data which are routinely collected. </sec> <sec> <title>METHODS</title> The CHES-RS has already been piloted in the HDSS at the Nouna Health Research Center in Burkina Faso, and it is currently being rolled out to two other HDSS sites, one in sub-Saharan Africa, respectively in the Siaya HDSS, Kenya, and the other in the South East Asia Community Observatory (SEACO) HDSS in Malaysia. CHES-RSs are ready to conduct research in the following major health sectors: climate/weather, land use and coverage/biodiversity, agriculture/household harvest, food security, household economics, as well as research in the field of one health, including zoonotic disease surveillance. CHES-RS uses digital sensors to measure three levels of exposure: (i) Individual-level data: consumer-grade wearable devices yield objective measures in vulnerable and rural populations, and an expanded HDSS questionnaire includes a full morbidity evaluation (ii) Household-level data comprises both indoor temperature measurements and remote sensing data captured through satellites (iii) Community-level data: comes from fully automated weather stations that record temperature, precipitation, solar radiation, wind speed, and direction. To handle heterogeneous data, we leverage graph databases for data management. </sec> <sec> <title>RESULTS</title> NA </sec> <sec> <title>CONCLUSIONS</title> To address current and emerging global health challenges over the next few decades, CHES-RSs will serve as a novel architecture for existing HDSSs and similar infrastructures of population-based surveillance cohorts. They may encourage ecosystems for climate change and health research, as well as big data analysis using artificial intelligence (AI), potentially providing the foundation for calculating climate change-induced disability-adjusted life years (cDALYs) and loss and damages. Using a routine morbidity panel survey and objectively measured health data, CHES-RS generate data-rich cohorts in countries where good quality health data is scarce, allowing for early interventions and earlier detection of risk factors for illnesses. </sec>","",https://doi.org/10.2196/preprints.44278,"",,
rayyan-220237020,Geospatial Techniques to Quantify Urban Change,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Rapid urbanization is threating the security of resources due to increasing demand. The influx of people into urban areas is causing changes to urban landscapes, as well as resulting in high unemployment and crime rates, pollution and urban sprawl. In addition, urban landscapes are encroaching and disturbing ecological infrastructure. Changes in the built-up area in Harare, Zimbabwe, between 1986 and 2018, were quantified using multispectral remote sensing. Land-use classification was done using Landsat images (urban and non-urban areas) using the random forest machine learning classifier. The developed land-use images were overlaid on population maps to compare urban growth with population increase. The influence of urban growth on climate change was assessed through an analysis of the changes in land surface temperature (LST), which was derived from a transect of different Landsat images over the review period. There are notable spatio-temporal, demographic and environmental transformations evidenced by the increasing urban population, land-use changes and rising temperatures. The built environment increased by more than 185 per cent between 1986 and 2018, at a rate of more than 5 per cent per annum. There were positive trends in landscape metrics, with the number of patches decreasing from 20,877 to 9,865. Significant increase in LST occurred due to the increase of impervious surfaces.","",https://doi.org/10.1201/9781003224624-13,"",,

However, this rapid and uncontrolled expansion poses risks to the coastal environment, economic development and biodiversity conservation. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) remote sensing can overcome the limitation of weather and has the advantage of all-day observing, which can effectively image the floating aquaculture area (FAR). In this study, we applied various deep learning methods to extract FAR by high-resolution Gaofen-3 (GF-3) SAR data. The trained and predicted datasets were constructed and trained by using U-Net, FCN, and SegNet networks. The results show that the U-Net and SegNet networks are more suitable than FCN, SegNet, and DeeplapV3+ networks for mariculture raft extraction in different scenarios.

rayyan-220237101,Mapping Sweden&amp;#8217;s drainage ditches using deep learning and airborne laser scanning,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Drainage ditches are common forestry practice across northern European boreal forests and in some parts of North America. Ditching helps with lowering the groundwater level in the wet parts of the forest to improve soil aeration and to support tree growth. However, the intensive ditching practice pose multidimensional environmental risks, particularly for degradation of wetland and soil, greenhouse gas, increased nutrient and sediment loadings to water bodies, as well as biodiversity loss. At the same time there is a discrepancy between the potential significance of artificial water bodies, such as drainage ditches and their low representation in scientific research and water management policy. A comparison with a national inventory of Sweden showed that only 9 % of drainage ditches are present on the best avalible map of Sweden. The increasing understanding of the environmental risks associated with forest ditches together with the poor representation of ditch networks in existing maps of many forest landscapes makes detailed mapping of these ditches a priority for sustainable land and water management. Here, we combine two state-of-the-art technologies &amp;amp;#8211; airborne laser scanning and deep learning - for detecting drainage ditches on a national scale.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#160;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;A deep neural network was trained on airborne laser scanning data and 1607 km of manually digitized ditch channels from 10 regions spread across Sweden. 20 % of the data was set aside for testing the model.&amp;amp;#160; The model correctly mapped 82 % of all small drainage channels in the test data with a Matthew's correlation coefficient of 0.72. This approach only requires one topographical index, a high pass median filter calculated from a digital elevation model with a 1 m spatial resolution. This made it possible to scale up over large areas with limited computational resources and the trained model was implemented using Microsoft Azure to map ditch channels across all of Sweden. The total mapped channel length was 970 00 km (equivalent to 24 times around the world). Visual inspection indicated that this method also classifies natural stream channels as drainage channels, which suggests that a deep neural network can be trained to detect natural stream channels in addition to drainage ditches. The model only required one topographical index which makes it possible to implement this approach in other areas with access to high resolution digital elevation data.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu22-4639,"",,
rayyan-220237104,Deforestation and climate change: The multiple pressures over Amazonian forests,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Amazonia is under significant stress from both deforestation and climate change. Multiple pieces of evidence show that the links between the hydrological and carbon cycles are fast changing. Deforestation is increasing in Amazonia, and in 2021, about 13,35 km&amp;amp;#178; of forests were converted, a value 22% larger than 2020. On the deforestation side, the government's recent public policies favor illegal occupation of public lands and invasion of indigenous territories protected by the Brazilian constitution. Deforestation brings forest degradation to the edges of deforested areas, increasing carbon emissions. The impact of climate change is less clear, with changes in the hydrological cycle and increased temperature, promoting forest degradation that makes parts of the Amazon Forest become a carbon source.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The Amazonian forest is a very complex system with multiple anthropogenic and climate change pressures. It is hard to know where a possible Amazonian tipping point could be and which variables or values could be the indicators for this possible tipping point. The role of intensified climate extremes is another critical variable, with Amazonia under increased intense droughts/inundation cycles in the last 30 years. Remote sensing measurements show that vapor pressure deficit is increasing for both perturbed Eastern and at the pristine Northern Amazonia. Several different studies show that the carbon uptake by undisturbed forests is not equilibrating the carbon emissions by deforestation for parts of Amazonia. CO&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; emissions associated with deforestation are increasing. The MapBiomas system provides detailed land-use change maps linked to meteorological information to apportion carbon emissions to forest degradation or deforestation. The role of soil emissions is not fully quantified for the overall Amazonia. We are developing a basin-wide system using big data strategies with machine learning, artificial intelligence, and other advanced techniques to address drivers for land-use changes in Amazonia and carbon and methane emissions and sinks. Flooded areas in Amazonia show significant methane emissions, and the effects of increasing floods and droughts cycles have an important impact on methane emissions.

rayyan-220237109,Subdomain Style Compensation Network for Remote Sensing Cross-Domain Scene Classification,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"High spatial resolution (HSR) imagery scene classification has been the subject of increased interest in recent years, and has great potential for many applications, such as urban planning and land cover classification. Deeping learning has been widely exploited in scene classification and achieved high classification accuracy. However, current the scene classification method based on deep learning depends on a large number of datasets for training, and the feature distribution of the default testing datasets is the same as that of the training datasets. In practical application, it is not only time-consuming and laborious to obtain a large number of training data, but also difficult to meet these needs due to the data shift between different domain. In addition, directly use of features extracted by the convolutional neural network (CNN) will lead to limited performance owing to the influence of domain migration. Therefore, how to effectively reduce the domain offset between the training data and the testing data, and discover discriminative information to scene classification is a challenging task. In this paper, the SSCN is proposed for HSR remote Sensing cross-domain scene classification. In SSCN, we introduce DSAN in which the local maximum mean discrepancy (LMMD) is first introduced for scene classification to capture the fine-grained information for each category and reduce the domain migration between training data and testing data. To extract more discriminative information from HSR images, a style normalization and restitution module (SNR) is developed, and an attention mechanism is added to the module to improve the performance of the model. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed SSCN framework is superior to the state-of-the-art methods <sup xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"">1</sup> and performs well for cross-domain scene classification.","",https://doi.org/10.1109/igarss46834.2022.9884646,"",,
rayyan-220237129,Predicting climate change impacts to peatland soil moisture in Southeast Asia,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Soil moisture is a key hydrologic variable that determines peat flammability and predicts burned area. In recent decades, there has been a rise in deadly peat fires across Southeast Asia, indicating the presence of dry conditions. This has largely been attributed to the extensive deforestation, drainage, and conversion to agricultural use that has occurred in the region. Climate also plays a role in mediating soil moisture, and the most severe fire years have previously only occurred when there are droughts during strong El Ni&amp;amp;#241;o years. Thus, climate change threatens drier peat soil moisture conditions which would increase peat fire risk. Here, we assess these potential impacts by modeling soil moisture responses to predicted climate change. To overcome the lack of regional-scale data for hydrologic variables and peat properties necessary to parametrize a physical model, we used for a statistical modeling approach. Specifically, we used an artificial neural network to relate remotely sensed observations of soil moisture (SMAP) to climate reanalysis forcings (ERA5) and other datasets that characterize peatland degradation such as tree cover and canal density. After training the neural network on data from 2015-2020, we then compared moisture regimes under recent and future climate from state-of-the-science regional climate model projections (CORDEX-CORE) under RCP 8.5. Our findings suggest that reduced precipitation and increased evaporative demand, as predicted by the regional climate models, may cause significantly drier soil moisture regimes in the future. Future mean dry season soil moisture is found to be similar to that during 2015 and 2019 El Ni&amp;amp;#241;o years, suggesting higher baseline fire risk. We further explore geographic differences in soil moisture responses, as mediated by differences in climate sensitivity between land use types.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu22-10763,"",,
rayyan-220237162,A deep learning approach for mapping and monitoring glacial lakes from space,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Climate change intensifies glacier melt which effectively leads to the formation of numerous new glacial lakes in the overdeepenings of former glacier beds. Additionally, the area of many existing glacial lakes is increasing. More than one thousand glacial lakes have emerged in Switzerland since the Little Ice Age, and hundreds of lakes are expected to form in the 21st century. Rapid deglaciation and formation of new lakes severely affect downstream ecosystem services, hydropower production and high-alpine hazard situations. Day by day, glacier lake inventories for high-alpine terrains are increasingly becoming available to the research community. However, a high-frequency mapping and monitoring of these lakes are necessary to assess hazards and to estimate Glacial Lake Outburst Flood (GLOF) risks, especially for lakes with high seasonal variations. One way to achieve this goal is to leverage the possibilities of satellite-based remote sensing, using optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellite sensors and deep learning.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There are several challenges to be tackled. Mapping glacial lakes using satellite sensors is difficult, due to the very small area of a great majority of these lakes. The inability of the optical sensors (e.g. Sentinel-2) to sense through clouds creates another bottleneck. Further challenges include cast and cloud shadows, and increased levels of lake and atmospheric turbidity. Radar sensors (e.g. Sentinel-1 SAR) are unaffected by cloud obstruction. However, handling cast shadows and natural backscattering variations from water surfaces are hurdles in SAR-based monitoring. Due to these sensor-specific limitations, optical sensors provide generally less ambiguous but temporally irregular information, while SAR data provides lower classification accuracy but without cloud gaps.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We propose a deep learning-based SAR-optical satellite data fusion pipeline that merges the complementary information from both sensors. We put forward to use Sentinel-1 SAR and Sentinel-2 L2A imagery as input to a deep network with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) backbone. The proposed pipeline performs a fusion of information from the two input branches that feed heterogeneous satellite data. A shared block learns embeddings (feature representation) invariant to the input satellite type, which are then fused to guide the identification of glacial lakes. Our ultimate aim is to produce geolocated maps of the target regions where the proposed bottom-up, data-driven methodology will classify each pixel either as &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;lake&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; or &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;background&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;. &amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;This work is part of two major projects: ESA AlpGlacier project that targets mapping and monitoring of the glacial lakes in the Swiss (and European) Alps, and the UNESCO (Adaptation Fund) GLOFCA project that aims to reduce the vulnerabilities of populations in the Central Asian countries (Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, and Kyrgyzstan) from GLOFs in a changing climate. As part of the GLOFCA project, we are developing a python-based analytical toolbox for the local authorities, which incorporates the proposed deep learning-based pipeline for mapping and monitoring the glacial lakes in the target regions in Central Asia.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu22-10637,"",,

In order to predict pluvial flood risks under different spatio-temporal conditions, three generalized Machine Learning models were developed and applied to the Metropolitan City of Venice: Logistic Regression, Neural Networks and Random Forest. The models considered 60 historical pluvial flood events, occurred in the timeframe 1995-2020. The historical events helped to identify and prioritize sub-areas that are more likely to be affected by pluvial flood risk due to heavy precipitation. In addition, while developing the model, 13 triggering factors have been selected and assessed: aspect, curvature, distance to river, distance to road, distance to sea, elevation, land use, NDVI, permeability, precipitation, slope, soil and texture. A forward features selection method was applied to understand which features better face spatio-temporal overfitting in pluvial flood prediction based on AUC score. Results of the analysis showed that the most accurate models were obtained with the Logistic Regression approach, which was used to provide pluvial flood risk maps for each of the 60 major historical events occurred in the case study area. The model showed high accuracy and most of the occured events in the Metropolitan City of Venice have been properly predicted, demostrating that Machine Learning could substantially improve and speed up disaster risk assessment and mapping helping in overcoming most common bottlenecks of physically-based simulations such as the computational complexity and the need of large datasets of high-resolution information.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu22-1346,"",,
rayyan-220237233,Do changes in tree‐ring δ<sup>18</sup>O indicate changes in stomatal conductance?,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Plant scientists have long been fascinated by the balance between photosynthetic carbon gain and transpirational water loss in terrestrial plants, because such a balance can have wide-ranging implications with respect to plant productivity and survival, ecosystem service and function, and even global-scale hydrology and climate forcing (Cowan & Farquhar, 1977; Bonan, 2008; Keenan et al., 2013). Intrinsic water use efficiency (iWUE, defined as the ratio of photosynthetic rate, A, to stomatal conductance, gs) is a frequently used trait to assess plant carbon–water balance. Due to the well-established, theoretical link between iWUE and photosynthetic carbon isotope discrimination (Farquhar et al., 1982), analysis of plant carbon isotope composition (δ13Cplant) has emerged as a popular method of estimating time-integrated iWUE during plant growth. However, the carbon isotope technique alone does not allow partitioning of iWUE between its component gas-exchange parameters (i.e. A and gs), and so is deemed to be insufficiently informative for a mechanistic understanding of iWUE responses to abiotic/biotic factors (Scheidegger et al., 2000; Farquhar et al., 2007). To address this limitation, researchers have suggested adding plant oxygen isotope composition (δ18O) into the isotope toolbox to help tease apart the influences of A vs gs on δ13Cplant-derived iWUE (Scheidegger et al., 2000; Grams et al., 2007). This suggestion stemmed from the theoretical prediction that, for plants exposed to similar environmental conditions, gs should exhibit a negative relationship with transpirative enrichment of leaf lamina water (Δ18Olw), and hence with the isotope composition of cellulose (δ18Ocel), which is known to preserve much of the Δ18Olw signal (Barbour et al., 2000; Scheidegger et al., 2000; Farquhar et al., 2007). In this case 'similar environmental conditions' refers primarily to similar δ18O of source water (δ18Osw) and ambient relative humidity (RH), as these are two important controlling factors of δ18Ocel. The predicted negative association of gs with δ18Ocel has gained support from the results of several glasshouse and field tests on different plant species (Barbour et al., 2000; Barbour & Farquhar, 2000; Scheidegger et al., 2000; Sullivan & Welker, 2006; Grams et al., 2007; Moreno-Gutiérrez et al., 2011), and consequently has resulted in the use of δ18Ocel as a proxy for gs to aid interpretation of physiological underpinnings of iWUE in numerous investigations (Siegwolf et al., 2021). While the early glasshouse/field examinations were conducted in ways to satisfy the 'similar growth environment' prerequisite of the theoretical negative gs–δ18Ocel relationship, an increasing number of 18O applications have instead focused on tree-ring cellulose in a temporal context, to gain retrospective insights into tree canopy gs responses to global change factors (Nock et al., 2011; Barnard et al., 2012; Fajardo et al., 2019; Guerrieri et al., 2019; Savard et al., 2020; Mathias & Thomas, 2021). Field-grown trees commonly experience pronounced interannual variations in δ18Osw and/or RH, so tree-ring cellulose δ18O (δ18Otr-cel)-based gs reconstructions do not necessarily conform to the 'similar growth environment' prerequisite. Several authors have thus urged caution over this type of temporal-context application (Roden & Siegwolf, 2012; Gessler et al., 2018), with Roden & Siegwolf (2012) explicitly highlighting several caveats/complexities that require attention, and recommending that one should rigorously account for the confounding isotopic and environmental variations either through measurement or modeling, if the goal is to assess the physiological responses that influence the measured δ18Otr-cel chronology. In this context, it is important to note that Guerrieri et al. (2019) recently developed a method to take care of the confounding variations in their attempt to infer temporal changes in gs from δ18Otr-cel. The method involves converting δ18Otr-cel to Δ18Olw following a three-step process: first, by assuming the local, current-year precipitation as the dominant source for tree source water, the δ18Osw of each year is simulated from climatic factors of the same year using a globally derived empirical model of precipitation δ18O (δ18Oprep; Barbour et al., 2001); second, tree-ring cellulose 18O enrichment above the source water (Δ18Otr-cel) is then calculated from the simulated δ18Oprep and the measured δ18Otr-cel; and third, the resultant Δ18Otr-cel chronology is subsequently used to derive a Δ18Olw chronology by inverting the well-established mechanistic model of Δ18Otr-cel (Sternberg, 2009), with potential climatic sensitivity of the model parameters (i.e. carbonyl oxygen exchange rate or pex) explicitly considered. Specifically, Guerrieri et al. (2019) suggested that one should check for interannual variation in RH, a potential driver of temporal variation in Δ18Olw. In cases where RH does not display an apparent trend during the time span encompassed by the δ18Otr-cel chronology, a negative gs–Δ18Olw relationship can be safely used to infer historical changes of gs from the derived Δ18Olw chronology. That is, when 'no systematic RH trend' is detected, a significant correlation between the derived Δ18Olw and time suggests a significant change in gs over time (the direction of which is opposite in sign from the calculated correlation coefficient or regression slope), while an insignificant correlation suggests gs remained relatively constant. By applying the above method to 12 tree species from eight forested sites in North America, Guerrieri et al. (2019) found that reductions in gs over the last 30 years were restricted to species from xeric sites. This result, combined with the tree-ring δ13C data showing a consistent increase in iWUE in response to rising atmospheric CO2 across all the sites, prompted the authors to reject the hypothesis that rising iWUE in forests 'is primarily caused by the widespread, CO2-induced reductions in gs' (Guerrieri et al., 2019). More recently, this method was also used by Mathias & Thomas (2021) in a meta-analysis of tree-ring isotope chronologies from 34 species across 84 sites globally. The results indicated no significant historical changes in gs over the past century in a majority (77.9%) of the tree–site combinations analyzed, again 'challenging the idea of widespread reductions in gs as the major driver of increasing tree iWUE' in response to past atmospheric CO2 increases (Mathias & Thomas, 2021). However, is the method proposed by Guerrieri et al. (2019) robust enough to guarantee a reliable inference of temporal directionality of changes in gs from δ18Otr-cel? Here, by examining this method in detail we highlight three aspects of insufficiency, each of which in our opinion is severe enough to render this method to be ineffective, as far as a δ18Otr-cel-based gs reconstruction is concerned. First, in Guerrieri et al. (2019) and Mathias & Thomas (2021), temporal changes in δ18Osw at each site were simulated using a spatial δ18Oprep model developed empirically by Barbour et al. (2001; hereafter the Barbour model). Such a 'space-for-time' substitution assumed that the environmental influences on δ18Oprep were the same across space and through time. However, it has long been recognized that the drivers of temporal variability in δ18Oprep can vary from site to site (Dansgaard, 1964; Gat et al., 2001). With this concern in mind, we tested the ability of the Barbour model for predicting the δ18Oprep variability at the site level using the δ18Oprep datasets archived in the Global Network of Isotopes in Precipitation (GNIP; https://www.iaea.org/services/networks/gnip). It turned out that only one (Ottawa, Canada) out of the eight selected sites displayed a significantly positive relationship between the simulated and the observed interannual variations in δ18Oprep, and the slope coefficients for the regression of the simulated δ18Oprep on the observed δ18Oprep were all far from unity (Fig. 1). This analysis (see Fig. 1 legend for more details) revealed that the Barbour model, for the most part, performed poorly in capturing the site-specific, temporal dynamics of δ18Oprep. As accurate prediction of δ18Oprep is critical in determining Δ18Otr-cell and/or Δ18Olw from δ18Otr-cell, the use of an unconfirmed spatial model is not appropriate for producing trustworthy time series of Δ18Otr-cel and/or Δ18Olw at each site. Interestingly, this point is evident in Guerrieri et al.'s (2019) own data (fig. S9 from Guerrieri et al., 2019), showing that the δ18Otr-cel-derived Δ18Olw could be quite different (i.e. by up to 5‰) from the actual measurement of Δ18Olw. While predicting large-scale spatiotemporal δ18Oprep is challenging (Terzer-Wassmuth et al., 2021), better options such as IsoMAP (Bowen et al., 2014) and IsoGSM (Yoshimura et al., 2008) do exist. Notably, Nelson et al. (2021) recently developed a machine learning approach to simulate temporal (intra and interannual resolution) δ18Oprep variations in Europe, and their simulations were substantially better than the existing models. We expect this promising modeling framework to be readily extended to other regions and deliver reliable estimates of δ18Oprep for retrospective research in tree-ring stable isotopes. Further, due to the complex mechanisms regulating soil water available for plant uptake (Allen et al., 2019; Goldsmith et al., 2022), the aforementioned assumption that local, current-year precipitation is the major source of tree source water might not always be met. If this is the case, isotope-enabled hydrological models can be helpful in capturing species-specific dynamics of δ18Osw at high temporal resolutions (Ogée et al., 2009; Brinkmann et al., 2018). Second, in their attempts to infer the directional changes in gs from the δ18Otr-cel-derived Δ18Olw chronology, both Guerrieri et al. (2019) and Mathias & Thomas (2021) considered the negative gs–Δ18Olw relationship to be universally applicable to all species included in their studies. The negative gs–Δ18Olw relationship was derived from the theoretical analyses of how gs modifies several isotopic/physiological parameters imbedded in the widely used Δ18Olw model that incorporates a Péclet effect (Sullivan & Welker, 2006; Grams et al., 2007; Roden & Siegwolf, 2012). Here, note that for plant cellulose-related isotopic signatures, the term Péclet effect implicitly refers to leaf lamina-associated radial Péclet effect, which by definition represents the relative balance between advection of unenriched leaf vein water via the transpiration stream and back diffusion of the enriched water from the evaporative sites in the leaf lamina (Farquhar & Lloyd, 1993). It is worth emphasizing that at the time when the gs–Δ18Olw negative relationship was theoretically inferred, it was conveniently assumed that: (1) the Péclet effect is pervasively present in different species, and (2) a key component governing the Péclet effect − known as the effective pathlength of water movement inside the leaf lamina or L − is a species-specific constant (Barbour & Farquhar, 2004; Kahmen et al., 2009). Under these assumptions, it can be predicted that Péclet-mediated isotope dynamics is a viable mechanism driving the negative gs–Δ18Olw association, as, for example, an increase in gs and/or transpiration rate (E) is predicted to cause a concomitant increase in the advective flux of unenriched xylem water to the leaf lamina, consequently leading to a decrease in Δ18Olw (Guerrieri et al., 2019). However, more recent studies have yielded experimental evidence that is inconsistent with either of the above two Péclet-related assumptions. For example, in their experimental survey of 27 species, Barbour et al. (2021) found that the Péclet effect was present in only 10 (37%) species; this indicates that the Péclet effect should not be taken for granted for all plant species (Song et al., 2015; Holloway-Phillips et al., 2016), thereby invalidating assumption 1. Furthermore, even for species in which the Péclet effect is operational, evidence has been mounting that L within a given species is variable and related to leaf transpiration rate (Ferrio et al., 2012; Song et al., 2013; Roden et al., 2015; but see Kahmen et al., 2009 for an exception), meaning that the 'species-specific L' assumption (assumption 2) is not necessarily valid. To examine the dynamics of Δ18Olw in response to gs with the updated knowledge related to the two assumptions, we performed a simple modeling exercise under three scenarios: no Péclet effect, a conventional Péclet effect (hereafter 'Péclet effect with a constant L') and a Péclet effect with a variable L based on an empirically determined L–E negative power relationship (Song et al., 2013). Given the annual resolution and integration of whole-canopy activities of tree-ring isotopic signatures, an isotopic steady state was assumed during our Δ18Olw modeling, similar to Roden & Siegwolf (2012). For demonstration purposes, we considered typical growing season environmental conditions for temperate trees (as detailed in the legend to Fig. 2) and simulated leaf temperature (Tl) at a given gs following Campbell & Norman (1998) before simulation of Δ18Olw (refer to Supporting Information Methods S1 for simulation details). The modeling results revealed a much-dampened sensitivity of Δ18Olw to gs under the 'no Péclet effect' scenario (gray dashed line in Fig. 2) than under the 'Péclet effect with a constant L' scenario (light blue line in Fig. 2). Concerning the 'no Péclet effect' scenario in particular, it can be seen that for every 0.1 mol m−2 s−1 change in gs, there is on average a change in Δ18Olw of −0.5‰, which can be translated to a −0.3‰ change in Δ18Otr-cel if the standard assumption is made that 60% of the Δ18Olw signal gets imprinted onto Δ18Otr-cel (Roden et al., 2000). Such a result − when viewed in the context of cellulose 18O measurement precisions typically reported in the literature (±0.3‰; Boettger et al., 2007) − leads us to suggest that an unambiguous detection of the gs signal in Δ18Otr-cel may not always be possible when the Péclet effect is absent. In this regard, it should be noted that a recent study combining isotope measurements with leaf hydraulic design considerations has identified coniferous needles as being more likely to fall into the 'no Péclet effect' category than broadleaf trees (Barbour et al., 2021). If this is the case (but see Roden et al., 2015), we would expect greater difficulty in detecting a true gs signal from isotope chronologies of conifers than from broadleaf trees, assuming everything else is equal. Such interspecies differences may at least partially explain why proportionally fewer conifers than broadleaf trees exhibited a significant gs changing trend in the metadataset of Mathias & Thomas (2021). The simulation we performed under the 'Péclet effect with a variable L' scenario yielded a pattern (dark blue line in Fig. 2) showing that the gs–Δ18Olw relationship was no longer negative, but nonmonotonic. That is, Δ18Olw increased with gs at low gs but decreased at high gs. As such, we conclude from our modeling results that the strength and direction of the gs–Δ18Olw relationship can be variable, depending on the specific parameter space confined by the species and its environment. As aforementioned, this modeling exercise was based on a commonly adopted steady-state assumption, and so did not consider nonsteady-state isotope dynamics under which more complicated processes involving a role of δ18Ov through vapor one-way flux through stomata (Lehmann et al., 2018, 2020; Farquhar et al., 2021) as well as its potential interaction with the Péclet-caused within-leaf enrichment gradients may also serve to mediate the gs–Δ18Olw relationship. Notwithstanding this, our modeling purpose was to demonstrate a diverse gs–Δ18Olw relationship by incorporating recent advances in 18O modeling and was not to provide an exhaustive survey on all possible patterns. Therefore, given the uncertainties in the validity of the Péclet-related assumptions, we consider it imprudent to assume a priori all species under different environmental/physiological conditions to consistently display a negative gs–Δ18Olw correlation that is strong enough for gs reconstruction. Third, as discussed above, interannual environmental fluctuations can be pronounced in long-term field studies such as Guerrieri et al.'s (2019), making the 'similar growth environment' prerequisite a challenge to satisfy. Among the multiple environmental variables, RH is usually the most important control for Δ18Olw (see Simonin et al., 2013 for a demonstration of their sensitivity analysis). Presumably for this reason, Guerrieri et al. (2019) proposed to relax the 'similar RH' requirement to a less stringent 'no systematic RH trend' one for applying the negative gs–Δ18Olw relationship. From a statistical perspective, increased data variability increases the likelihood of mistakenly accepting the null hypothesis (i.e. the Type II error, see Ott & Longnecker, 2001) if sample size remains the same. Thus, allowing RH as well as other environmental variables such as atmospheric water vapor δ18O (Gat et al., 2001; Munksgaard et al., 2020) to fluctuate from year to year (in spite of no systematic trend) could introduce additional variability to Δ18Olw, in turn lowering the probability of detecting a significant correlation between the derived Δ18Olw and time, if it actually exists. That is, the tree–site combinations with a true directional change in gs over time may be mistakenly judged as those without, due to the background 'noise' in Δ18Olw produced by environmental fluctuations. As a result, even with the assumptions that δ18Osw was adequately simulated and a negative gs–Δ18Olw relationship is robust for use in Mathias & Thomas (2021), the insignificant correlation between the derived Δ18Olw and time in 77.9% of their tree–site combinations may not be interpreted with certainty that gs remained relatively constant in these cases. Our analyses have highlighted three outstanding issues related to the method proposed by Guerrieri et al. (2019) for retrospectively inferring gs changes from tree-ring cellulose δ18O chronologies: the proposed use of a δ18Oprep spatial model does not guarantee accurate estimation of interannual variation in δ18Osw, making the practice of converting δ18Otr-cell to Δ18Olw prone to error; due to the complications related to the Péclet effect, no universal gs–Δ18Olw relationship can be applied to interpret variations in Δ18Olw; and even in a case where a negative gs–Δ18Olw/Δ18Otr-cel relationship is robust, the varied interannual environmental influences on Δ18Olw/Δ18Otr-cel may produce a strong background 'noise', impeding an effective detection of the gs 'signal' preserved in Δ18Olw/Δ18Otr-cel. These highlighted uncertainties aside, it is also important to note that the required conversion of δ18Otr-cel to Δ18Olw in Guerrieri et al.'s (2019) method hinges upon the current mechanistic model of δ18Otr-cel, yet the mechanisms driving interannual variability in certain model parameters (e.g. pex) are far from being sufficiently understood (Song et al., 2015; Cheesman & Cernusak, 2017; Szejner et al., 2020), which could further undermine the credibility of this method. Because these concerns were not adequately addressed by Guerrieri et al. (2019) and Mathias & Thomas (2021), the gs patterns inferred from δ18Otr-cell in these studies (i.e. gs remained relatively unchanged in a majority of their sites) should be viewed with skepticism. In spite of the criticisms raised in this Letter, we remain optimistic that the dual isotope approach holds great promise for improving our understanding of the physiological responses of plants to the environment (Siegwolf et al., 2021). Nevertheless, it is necessary to note that previous experimental verifications of this approach have focused largely on leaf-level, 'side-by-side comparison' scenarios; in the only tree-ring-targeted, controlled experimental testing performed so far, Roden & Farquhar (2012) showed that the dual isotope framework was not fully operational. Future studies aiming to use the dual isotope approach at the tree-ring level should perform experiments to clarify scenarios where the gs signal can be detected from the tree-ring cellulose, and/or rigorously evaluate and constrain the uncertainties outlined in this Letter by examining relevant species traits and associated environmental conditions on a case-by-case basis, so as to improve confidence in the gs information extracted from the δ18Otr-cel time series.

rayyan-220237260,"Using deep convolutional neural networks for mapping of rill erosion of the pre-Volga region (Republic of Tatarstan, Russia)",,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Soil erosion all over the world is an intensive, poorly controlled process. In many ways, this is a consequence of the lack of up-to-date high-resolution erosion maps. All over the world, the problem of information insufficiency is solved in different ways, mainly point-by-point, in local territories. Extrapolation of locally obtained results to a larger area inevitably leads to uncertainties and errors. For the anthropogenically developed part of Russia, this problem is particularly relevant, because the assessment of the intensity of erosion processes, even with the use of erosion models, does not allow to achieve the required scale due to the lack of all the necessary global large-scale remote sensing data of the Earth and the complexity of considering regional features of erosion over such large areas. The paper proposes a new technique for automated large-scale mapping of erosion processes, namely rill erosion, according to Sentinel-2. Deep learning neural networks are used to recognize washouts. To recognize rills, a transfer learning approach was used, namely, a combination of the LinkNet architecture with the EfficientNetB3 encoder. The accuracy of automated recognition of rill erosion in the study area of 3,200 square kilometers is 80% compared to the results of manual recognition. The average density of the rill erosion was 0.3 km/sq.km, the maximum – 0.66 km/sq.km. The greatest density of washouts corresponds to the plowed deforested territories actively used in agriculture, the minimum – is on cultivated lands with contour farming.","",https://doi.org/10.1117/12.2643529,"",,

Amongst a number of solutions, carbon trading schemes have been introduced, such as the EU Emission Trading System that is used in programs where local smallholder farmers benefit from transitioning towards agroforestry.

rayyan-220237404,Assessing the Suitability of A Posteriori Random Forests for Downscaling Climate Change Projections,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Statistical downscaling (SD) methods are extensively used to provide high-resolution climate information based on the coarse outputs from Global Climate Models (GCM). In the context of climate change and under the perfect prognosis approach, these methods learn the relationships that link several large-scale predictor variables coming from a reanalysis (e.g. humidity) with the local variables of interest (e.g. precipitation) over a reference historical period. Subsequently, the so-learnt relationships are applied to GCM predictors to obtain downscaled projections for a future period.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In a recent paper, Legasa et al. (2021) introduced a posteriori random forests (AP-RFs), a modification of classical random forests which make use of all the data in the leaves to estimate any probability distribution. Following the experimental framework proposed in Experiment 1 of VALUE (http://www.value-cost.eu, Guti&amp;amp;#233;rrez et al. 2018), the study showed that AP-RFs obtained reliable stochastic time-series over several locations in Europe using reanalysis predictors. As compared to more classical techniques like generalized linear models (GLMs), this study concluded that AP-RFs are a competitive SD method in terms of different forecast aspects, with one of their key advantages being the ability to automatically perform predictor/feature selection. This avoids the task of manually selecting the most adequate large-scale variables and geographical domain of interest, something which, at present, relies on human expertise and constitutes a substantial source of uncertainty for downscaling climate change projections.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Nevertheless, an assessment of the suitability of AP-RFs for producing local climate change projections from GCM predictors is still lacking. This work aims to fill this gap by providing a fair comparison of AP-RFs with GLMs and state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which were recently shown to provide satisfactory results for this task (Ba&amp;amp;#241;o-Medina et al. 2021). We build on VALUE&amp;amp;#8217;s Experiment 2a and train the different methods considered using ERA-Interim &amp;amp;#8220;perfect&amp;amp;#8221; predictors. Afterwards, the EC-Earth model is used to generate downscaled projections for 86 locations distributed across Europe under a strong emission scenario, the RCP8.5.&amp;amp;#160;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Our preliminary results suggest that AP-RFs generate plausible downscaled future projections of precipitation. In particular, differently to traditional GLMs, which are very sensitive to the predictor set considered and may produce implausible climate change projections (Manzanas et al. 2020), this technique yields delta changes consistent with those obtained from both the raw EC-EARTH outputs and the CNNs.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;References&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Ba&amp;amp;#241;o-Medina, J., Manzanas, R. &amp;amp; Guti&amp;amp;#233;rrez, J.M. &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;On the suitability of deep convolutional neural &amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;networks for continental-wide downscaling of climate change projections&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;.

Currently, most approaches are limited by coarse resolution, commercial data, and geographic specificity. Landscape scale wetland conservation requires reliable approaches to wetland mapping that are spatially generalizable, temporally repeatable, and automated. Here, we trained a deep learning model and evaluate its ability to meet these criteria. We trained a U-Net architecture to map wetlands at 1-meter spatial resolution with the following covariates: remotely sensed multispectral data from the National Agriculture Imagery Program and the Sentinel-2 satellite system, and two surface-based products, i.e., LiDAR intensity and geomorphon.The full model, with 94% accuracy, 96.5% precision and 95.2% AUC, mapped wetlands at 1-meter resolution that multiple experts found highly efficient. Post hoc model evaluation showed that the model correctly predicted wetlands even in areas that had incorrect label/training data, which penalized the recall rate (90.2%). Applying the model in a new geography resulted in poor performance (precision = ~80%, recall = 48%). We demonstrate wetlands can be mapped at high-resolution (1 m) using free data and efficient deep-learning models that do not require manual feature engineering. Including LiDAR and geomorphon predictor data improved model accuracy by 2%, and where these data are unavailable a simpler model can efficiently map wetlands. Given the dynamic nature of wetlands and the important ecosystem services they provide, high-resolution mapping can be a game changer in terms of informing restoration and development decisions. While these models were initially ineffective outside geographies in which they were trained, limited retraining in a new geography produced an accurate model, demonstrating an effective means to create a spatially generalizable model.","",https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4165348,"",,

However, these mechanistic models are often subject to large uncertainties, largely due to the limited understanding of the biological controls, particularly how plants control the land-to-atmosphere water flux by closing and opening their stomata.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Here, we propose a data-adaptive hybrid modeling approach for ET that combines the physics-based PM equation with machine learning (ML) by inferring the biological and aerodynamic regulator of the evaporative water flux from observations. Specifically, the framework comprises setting up a feed-forward neural network and integrating the physically-constraining PM equation in the loss function of the latent heat flux (LE). The stomatal resistance (r&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;s&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt;) and aerodynamic resistance (r&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;a&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt;) are modeled as intermediate latent variables, based on micro-meteorological observations collected and curated in the FLUXNET database.&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;For baseline comparison, two conceptually different ML models have been set up, where the first model simulates LE directly without imposing any physical constraints and the second model is an alternative pseudo-hybrid model approach [1], where the main distinction lies in the formulation of the loss function.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#160;Our hybrid model is capable of capturing the diurnal and seasonal variations between the mean values of predicted and observed LE. The obtained data-driven parameterizations of the latent variables r&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;s &amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt;and r&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;a&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#160;are evaluated against the micro-meteorological conditions to validate their physical plausibility. &amp;amp;#160;We show that our hybrid modeling approach not only improves the rigid ad-hoc formulations of mechanistic models using observations, but also that hybrid models provide interpretable results that obey the physical laws of energy and mass conservation, in contrast to black-box ML models.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Our presented hybrid modeling approach can be extended to global generalizations of LE flux estimates and serve as observation-based parameterizations of r&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;s &amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt;and r&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;a&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#160;in complex land surface and Earth system models.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;[1]&amp;amp;#160;&amp;amp;#160;&amp;amp;#160;&amp;amp;#160;&amp;amp;#160; W.

rayyan-220237523,Land evaluation for olive growing after tobacco and its implication on soil erosion,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fruit and crop cultivation represents the main food source and produce important incomes in many countries worldwide but, in many cases, they can cause soil erosion and lead to extreme land degradation. Understanding and quantifying the impact of land use on soil erosion is essential to achieve sustainable land management. In Umbria region in Central Italy, olive and tobacco are two of the most profitable crops, spread on the slopes of mountains and hills or in the Tiber river valley, respectively. In particular, tobacco production, spread in the last decades along the plains and foothills of the northern part of the region, posed serious threats to the ecosystem, causing soil erosion and representing an alarming source of chemical pollution.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In this study, the environmental advantages of replacing tobacco crop with perennial olive groves were evaluated. For this purpose, a method is proposed, initially, to evaluate land suitability for olive cultivation based on machine learning methods and on a set of geomorphological and climatic variables, and then to evaluate the impact of land use conversion from arable crops to olive groves on soil erosion, using LANDPLANER model and considering different rainfall scenarios. LANDPLANER is able to estimate the effects of rainfall on the triggering of landslides and erosion processes and their competition on the slopes. Results show that such conversion is sustainable for more than 40% of the current tobacco production area and it may reduce soil erosion up to 50%. This study provides a framework that starting from a statistical model for land evaluation for new agricultural purposes, assesses the impact of land use change on soil erosion. It provides a method useful to promote a sustainable use of soil, taking into account also effects of agricultural changes effect on soil erosion and degradation.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu22-9817,"",,
rayyan-220237524,Crop water productivity studies of leading world crops in California utilizing advanced multispectral remote sensing and modeling on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As the global population expands in the 21&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;st&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; century, demand for food and water are increasing whereas supply of arable land and accessible fresh water are decreasing. A way to mitigate this looming problem is to increase agricultural Crop Water Productivity (CWP) by improving how much yield (e.g., grain, biomass) is produced per unit of water. To produce more crop with less water (more crop per drop) over large scales, a better understanding of measuring, modeling, and mapping CWP of major world crops utilizing multi-sensor remote sensing, meteorological data, crop yield statistics, and cloud based machine learning is needed. &amp;amp;#160;This study aims to establish a novel methodology to measure evapotranspiration and CWP of select crops at 30m resolution. To accomplish this, a benchmark study area within the San Joaquin section of the Central Valley of California, USA was chosen to represent a diverse agricultural growing region. Within this area, leading and high-water consuming world crops were selected and mapped with respective growing seasons determined by NDVI analysis. Actual evapotranspiration (Et&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;a&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt;) as a proxy for water use was determined with new methods to map Evaporative Fraction (Et&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;f&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt;) and Reference Evapotranspiration (Et&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;o&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt;) per crop type. Using the equation Et&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;a&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; = Et&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;o&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; x Et&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;f&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt;, a novel approach for hot and cold pixel selection in image analysis was developed to determine Et&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;f&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; utilizing Landsat thermal bands in conjunction with Google Earth Engine (GEE).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This analysis determined CWP for nine major world crops (almonds, cotton, wheat, pistachios, grapes, barley, rice, corn, and walnuts) specific to individual crop growing seasons. This study also provides the quantum of water that can be saved if CWP is raised by 10, 20, and 30% relative to existing water use, thus establishing a pathway to create potential water banks from the saved water. Although this study focused on California, the application of methods used has potential to expand globally. This methodology provides insight to help ensure water security and potentially implement better water management strategies in the 21&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;st&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; century.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu22-6517,"",,
rayyan-220237532,"Combining nutrient competition, dynamic vegetation, and parameter calibration to improve boreal forest predictions to changing climate",,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;While climate change is impacting all parts of the globe, boreal forests are experiencing disproportionally higher rates of temperature increase, thus drastically impacting one of the largest biomes in the world. Changes in high-latitude forests have strong implications to the regional water and carbon cycling, and shifts in canopy cover (i.e., abundance and shifts between evergreen and deciduous species) will alter albedo, ecosystem productivity, and surface and canopy water fluxes. For example, high latitude warming may increase nutrient availability via a deepening of the soil active layer. Warming also induces permafrost degradation and loss, leading to strong interactions that alter the hydrology, and soil biological and physical processes. These climate-related interactions will affect plant competitive interactions, survival, and ultimately community distribution and carbon storage. In this study we explore how vegetation dynamics will be affected by changes in plant and microbial N competition, differences in nutrient demand due to shifts in PFTs (e.g., faster resource acquisition in deciduous plants), and ultimately carbon allocation. To be able to accurately predict and model these complex ecological processes we are using a new demographic vegetation model (FATES; Functionally-Assembled Terrestrial Ecosystem Simulator) that is coupled to ELMv1, the land surface model in the global Earth System Model - E3SM. We present here the newly implemented representation of nutrient competition, acquisition, and extensible approach of nutrient and carbon allocation within plants in the ELM-FATES model. This work has successfully coupled the interactions of nutrients between soil biogeochemistry (BGC) in ELM and plant productivity and carbon in FATES, with improved model hypothesis testing for plant&amp;amp;#8217;s nutrient storage capacity. With the inclusion of nutrient cycling in the previously &amp;amp;#8216;carbon-only&amp;amp;#8217; ELM-FATES where the largest competition was light driven, the productivity and biomass storage was significantly reduced for the simulated boreal forests. After conducting an uncertainty quantification experiment (i.e., using large ensembles to generate surrogate models) in order to test the model parameter sensitivity, we found that model parameters related to carbon storage and leaf economics had the largest sensitivity on plant processes. We then applied a Bayesian inference approach using neural networks to calibrate the model parameters against observational datasets, and greatly improved model predicts to match field inventory data. &amp;amp;#160;These newly represented ecological-based processes have helped to improve the representation of these vulnerable forests in an Earth System Model.&amp;amp;#160;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu22-10649,"",,

The salt pans in the &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Neusiedler See &amp;amp;#8211; Seewinkel National Park&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; are a unique ecosystem for animal and plant species especially adapted to the extreme conditions prevailing in and around the salt pans. The conservation of the salt pans is largely based on the interplay with the water balance of the area and the influence of physical as well as anthropogenic factors. The large number of lakes, which are often only filled with water for a short time due to their shallow depth, makes monitoring by means of installed gauges more difficult. Remote sensing, on the other hand,&amp;amp;#160; is an important source of consistent&amp;amp;#160; information in space and time. In the &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;FEMOWinkel &amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;project, which is funded within the framework of the Austrian &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;StartClim&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; 2021 program, long time series of multispectral satellite data are exploited for monitoring and data-driven modeling of water extent in the salt pans.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The water bodies are delineated based on image time series of the Landsat satellites, which have been providing data almost continuously since the 1980s. Cloud gaps will partly be filled with radar-based information provided by European Copernicus &amp;amp;#8211; Programme. The derived time series of water body extent and number are validated by comparison with aerial photographs and &amp;amp;#8211; where available &amp;amp;#8211; water levels. The salt pans are characterized with respect to their seasonal variability and their reaction to longer-term changes in water availability by comparison with ancillary data, e.g., surface and groundwater levels, climate data and other remote sensing products, such as soil moisture and vegetation indices. In the third step, a data-driven modeling of the lake extent is carried out using machine learning methods. We will also address the question of whether it is possible to predict the effects of dry or wet winters and springs on water body extent in the following summer using these methods.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Preliminary results of the time series analysis show a pronounced dynamic in the extent of the water bodies over the course of the study time. Periods, e.g., from 1990 to 1993 and 2001 to 2007, in which some of the lakes fell dry, alternated with wetter periods, e.g., from 1994 to 1999, in which the salt pans remained at least partially filled even in summer. These differences correlate with drought indicators such as the Standardised Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI). The remote sensing-based approach will make it possible to transfer the applied methods to other similar ecosystems located in steppe regions.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu22-11157,"",,
rayyan-220237534,Mapping Peatlands in Denmark Using Electromagnetic Methods,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Peatlands play a major role in the global carbon cycle as they constitute around 20% of the soil carbon (C) stock and act simultaneously as C sinks (for CO&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;2 &amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt;absorption) and sources (of CH&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;4 &amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt;emission). Additionally, they support biodiversity preservation and provide important ecosystem services like climate regulation. Draining the peat for agriculture purposes results in its consolidation, enhanced decomposition, and subsequent subsidence. This accompanied by global warming promotes the emission of greenhouse gases making peatlands a C source ecosystem. Globally, as pent-up demand, different initiatives are put forward to protect, properly manage, and restore peatlands mainly to reduce these emissions and slow down climate change. For example, from 2021 onwards, under the EU 2030 climate and energy framework, all the member states are supposed to report on the emissions and removals of greenhouse gases from wetland areas. Denmark has its own national goal of reducing CO&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; emissions by 70% by 2030. However, the extent and status of peatlands are still poorly determined. Comprehensive mapping is required to enforce measures to prevent their further degradation, estimate the C stock and forecast the future emissions from peatlands. The conventional mapping approach using peat probes is time-consuming, tedious, and provides only localized and discrete measurements. Though these measurements are somewhat reliable, it is still challenging because occasionally the probes are obstructed by stones or human artefacts. On contrary to the latter, sometimes they might also easily penetrate the soil underlying the actual peat. While remote sensing based on satellite and aerial imagery makes delineation of the spatial extent possible, electromagnetic methods that have a deeper penetration into the soil are required to provide knowledge on peat volume estimates and groundwater depth. As a part of the ReDoCO2 (viz. Reducing and Documenting CO2 emissions from Peatlands) project, we employ state-of-the-art geophysical sensors, precisely, working on electromagnetic induction, ground-penetrating radar, and gamma-ray radiometric principles to accurately characterize three peatland areas in Denmark. The sensors are being tested in both proximal and remote configurations and efforts are underway to develop a novel drone-based transient electromagnetic induction sensor. Later, we plan to fuse the multisource datasets using machine learning to improve the prediction accuracy and advanced modelling techniques to study the effects of different management scenarios on greenhouse gas emissions. We envision developing a framework for detailed three-dimensional mapping of peatlands and a tool to estimate the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions to support decision-makers in choosing an appropriate management strategy. The project outcomes will have a significant economic, societal, and environmental impact strengthening Denmark&amp;amp;#8217;s position as a green frontrunner.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu22-791,"",,

The rapid transition from &amp;amp;#160;a landscape dominated by peat plateaus to one dominated by connected wetlands (fens) and isolated wetlands (bogs) is intricately connected to permafrost thaw. To be able to predict and estimate the potential long-term evolution of these three dominant land covers, we developed a machine learning-based time series land cover change model (TSLCM). The TSLCM is trained on a set of spatio-temporal variables as driving factors of change including: the estimated summertime land surface temperature anomaly (LST), the distance to land cover interfaces, time intervals between observations, time-accumulated land surface temperature, and classified land cover maps from 1970-2008. The TSLCM is used to capture &amp;amp;#160;spatial patterns of change, replicate historical land cover change, and generate reasonable estimates of future land cover evolution over time. The output of TSLCM model is the spatial distribution of fen, bogs, and peat plateaus consistent with a default 50\%\ threshold applied on the predicted probability maps.&amp;amp;#160;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;We here use the TSLCM to simulate land cover change under multiple plausible futures scenarios by using the most recent set of climate model projections.

Historically, peatlands in Ireland have been used for industrial peat extraction and domestic turf cutting. One such example is Cavemount bog, County Offaly, Ireland a former raised bog where peat extraction started in the 1970s and ceased in 2015. After 2015, &amp;amp;#160;a programme of rehabilitation commenced by rewetting the site to raise water levels and to promote the establishment of wetland habitats. Some of the key species associated with the vegetation communities that have been developing across the site include &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Betula pubescens&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Calluna vulgaris&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Eriophorum angustifolium&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Typha latifolia&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Phragmites australis&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;To monitor the progress of the colonisation of natural vegetation as part of the rehabilitation plan, reliable habitat maps are required. Google Earth Engine (GEE) is a cloud computing platform where satellite images can be processed to obtain cloud-free composite images. GEE was used to develop an automated approach to map the habitats at Cavemount using multispectral satellite imagery (Sentinel-2) and a machine-learning model i.e. random forest classifier. In this study 9 habitat classes were used which included bare peat, coniferous trees, heather, heather and scrub, open water, pioneer open cutaway habitats, scrub pioneer open cutaway habitats, wetland and mosaic of wetland and scrub. Cloud-free composites for the growing season (May to September) using satellite imagery from 2018-2021 were used to get spectral indices such as NDVI (normalised difference vegetation index), NDWI (normalised difference water index), mNDWI (modified normalised difference water index), red-edge vegetation index, EVI (enhanced vegetation index) and BSI (bare soil index). To extract open water, a seasonal composite of mNDWI was used which could differentiate water from bare peat. The seasonal composite of mNDWI was also used to monitor flooding over winter periods due to increased rainfall and was compared with summer conditions. These indices along with 10 spectral bands (10-20 m resolution) were used as an input to a random forest model, and a yearly habitat map from 2018 to 2021 was developed. The overall accuracy for the testing data from 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021 was 87.42%, 86.81%, 87.16% and 87.50% and kappa coefficient was 0.81, 0.80, 0.81 and 0.81 respectively. Over time, the former peat extraction area showed a transformation from bare peat to a mosaic of wetland vegetation. This methodology will provide a useful tool for the long-term monitoring of the habitats at this site and to evaluate the effect of rehabilitation on the ecological composition of the site. The final habitat map will also be integrated with the eddy covariance data from the site to provide further insight into the carbon and greenhouse gas dynamics of each habitat in the future.&amp;amp;#160; &amp;amp;#160;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu22-1082,"",,
rayyan-220237630,The Battle Rages On,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"These are fraught times for supporters in academia of economic development. Prodevelopment folk are viewed by many as being tainted by a number—and perhaps a majority—of the seven deadly sins, and for attempting to worsen one or another “existential” environmental problem. Thanks to luminaries such as Amitav Ghosh and Bill McKibben, they are seen as deluded, if not deranged, and chastised for striving to push the pace, even as the human race “falters.” In days of yore, one could expect some corners of academia—economics departments, engineering schools, programs in the history of technology—to offer robust support to proponents of development, to “have their backs,” as it were. Now, not so much, as the precautionary principle, safety-ism, and belief in Ghosh's “nutmeg's curse” course through academia, trumping the fact that in 2022 around 700 million people—over 9 percent of the world's population—still live in extreme poverty ($1.90 or less a day), with almost half of the world's population as recently as 2015 living on under $5.50 a day in terms of purchasing power parity or PPP, according to the World Bank. This is the bristly backdrop for Humans versus Nature, Daniel R. Headrick's important new book.On the surface, the subject of Headrick's book is a bit surprising. The author is not primarily an environmental historian but a distinguished historian of technology who has written a number of well-regarded studies in the latter vein, particularly pertaining to the early modern and modern periods. But certain changes in the way the history of technology is now being done make Headrick's new focus and argument more understandable. As implied above, until relatively recently, historians of technology, generally speaking, were bullish on invention and innovation. They typically focused on how human ingenuity transformed “nature” and its resources into tools, implements, methods, and processes that advanced humans' material well-being and made possible the more complex and sophisticated sociocultural formations and expressions we used to refer to, however ingenuously, as civilizations. To be sure, many historians of technology over the years, including Headrick, wrote on the deleterious distributional effects one or another technology often had for some humans and some human societies, even as said technology elevated others. However, unlike environmental historians, let alone environmentalist historians, few got exercised over the effects technology had on “nature” or the “natural world.” The title of perhaps the most famous modern history of the Industrial Revolution—The Unbound Prometheus (1969) by David S. Landes—is suggestive in this regard.How things have changed. Today, historians of technology, formerly admirers of innovation, often decry human “tools” and innovations such as large dams, nuclear power reactors, genetically modified organisms, and artificial intelligence. Some, joining up with kindred spirits in environmental history, charge humans with narrow, selfish speciesism, while still others, influenced by Arne Naess and other deep ecologists, are disenamored of the human “footprint” itself. Exaggerating only slightly: humans bad, nature good. Notwithstanding the title of his new book, Headrick is too sophisticated a scholar to fall into that dualistic trap. In his study, he correctly sees humans as part of nature, and ipso facto humans and the rest of the natural world as being connected inextricably, however uneasily and at times adversarially. At least at the margin, though, his present sympathies seem to lie with the “natural world,” whose “agency” in the form of negative “feedback” is increasingly giving ravenous, rapacious humans the comeuppance they have in his view long deserved.Headrick's foray into “big history”—technological, environmental, or otherwise—represents another departure from his earlier scholarship. Whereas his previous work never extended back in time before about 1400 CE, his temporal scope in Humans versus Nature is far greater, extending back almost 2 million years to the appearance in Africa of one hominid species, Homo erectus, from which many believe our own, Homo sapiens, emerged somewhere around three hundred thousand years ago. Headrick handles this immense swath of time with considerable aplomb. One of the many virtues of Humans versus Nature is its author's ability to organize the earth's environmental history over the (really) longue durée into comprehensible units of time and then cogently to describe and analyze the principal developments.As Headrick's title suggests, “interactions between humans and the rest of nature” are central to his study. According to the author, two aspects of these interactions stand out: “One is the human impacts on the rest of nature and how they have changed over time. The other is how nature, in turn, has affected humans and human civilizations, especially the ‘natural disasters’ that have disrupted (and sometimes reversed) the advancing power of nature over the natural world” (4). Well-chosen examples of such interactions—from the Paleolithic to the present—inform Humans versus Nature, which is divided into fifteen chapters, organized chronologically for the most part, along with a concise but effective introduction and a provocative epilogue.Chapters 1 through 3 treat the increasingly contested interpretive terrain regarding the proper classification and valorization of early human subsistence strategies and habitation patterns—that is to say, those associated with hunters and gatherers (“foragers”) and with farmers and herders. From my perspective, it is unfortunate that Headrick for the most part accepts the increasingly ascendant and, more to the point, trendy position elevating hunter-gatherers vis-à-vis farmers and herders, downplaying the positive dimensions and implications of the “Neolithic Revolution.” It is one thing to challenge the linearity of the move to agriculture and animal domestication, and it is also correct to point out the (many) problems occasioned by the shift. It is reasonable, too, to point out some of the dietary and health benefits associated with hunting and gathering and to note what seems to have been foragers' relatively light workloads. It is not acceptable, however, to do so without laying out in full the many problems and limitations associated with foraging communities, and without commenting about their low developmental ceilings. And it is as fatuous as it is unconscionable to refer to agriculture as “the worst mistake in the history of the human race,” as Jared Diamond, one of the champions of hunter-gatherers, infamously did many years ago.1 To his credit, Headrick's support of the new orthodoxy is measured. His balanced assessment in chapter 3 of the emergence and development of complex, hierarchical, agricultural civilizations based on sophisticated water control/irrigation works in various parts of the ancient world—Mesopotamia, Egypt, the Indus Valley, and the Americas—testifies to this point.In chapters 4 and 5 Headrick pushes ahead, homing in on the Eastern Hemisphere and treating the interactions between humans and the environment in Eurasia and Africa between about 1500 BCE and 1400 CE. Obviously, it is difficult to generalize about developments over such a huge area over such a long period of time, but Headrick emphasizes the constant tension between aggressive human populations pushing, seemingly inexorably, to expand both economically and demographically, and an overstretched nature pushing back. Such pushback was sometimes insidious, but sometimes blunt and brutal, as in the cases of the Justinianic plague of the sixth century CE and the so-called Black Death of the fourteenth century CE, which Headrick views as outgrowths and unintended consequences of the expansion and increased connectivity of human communities across Afro-Eurasia.Readers today will be particularly interested in one of the timely topics treated in chapter 5: the so-called medieval climate anomaly. This anomaly, marked by a pattern of significantly warmer temperatures in much of Afro-Eurasia from the eighth to the fourteenth centuries CE, promoted the expansion and growth of human settlements over much of Afro-Eurasia. It was followed, alas, by the dislocations of the so-called Little Ice Age, some of which are interpreted by Headrick as expressions of nature's agency manifested in harvest failures, plague, civil strife, and other forms of negative “feedback.”Headrick shifts his attention to the Western Hemisphere in chapter 6, detailing the monumental and, for Native Americans, cataclysmic consequences of the opening of contacts between Afro-Eurasia and the Americas in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, understood by most scholars today in the context of Alfred Crosby's famous term “the Columbian Exchange.”2 So profound were the consequences of this exchange—biological, demographic, economic, cultural, political, and so on—that it is difficult even today to comprehend them fully.More or less the same time period is treated in chapter 7, but the focus is back to the Eastern Hemisphere, which, of course, was deeply affected not only by the Columbian Exchange, but also by shocks—harvest failures, famines, political and social upheavals, and so on—sparked by, or at least associated with the cooler weather prevailing during the “Little Ice Age.” The deleterious effects of cooler weather for humans were most powerful in the early modern period but stretched well into the nineteenth century in some areas. No part of the Eastern Hemisphere was immune to weather-related shocks, disturbances, and dislocations, which reverberated through Europe, Africa, the Middle East, and Asia.Humans fought back with a vengeance, as it were, beginning in the eighteenth century with the onset of the Industrial Revolution. For our purposes, this metaphorical revolution can be interpreted as shorthand for the development and/or increased deployment of new energy sources, along with technologies and methods relating to production, organization, capital mobilization, communications, and distribution. Taken together, this led over time to significant and sustained gains in economic output and productivity and to the vast range of changes that have often been subsumed under the rubrics of modernization or development. The changes growing out of this “revolution,” according to Headrick, led to a “sudden increase in the power of humans over nature,” which, however enriching and beneficial to humans, has left nature reeling (6).Headrick devotes chapters 8 and 9 to the key economic and environmental changes brought about by the Industrial Revolution. He focuses in the first of these chapters on two of the centers of the revolution, Great Britain and especially the United States, documenting the economic transformation and massive surge in economic output associated with industrialization as well as its sizable environmental and human costs, which in the United States would include at minimum land and water pollution, deforestation, the “Bison Holocaust,” and the devastation of Native American communities as a result of wars and diseases.In chapter 9, Headrick shifts his attention to the impact of the Industrial Revolution on the periphery—that is, nonindustrializing parts of the world, particularly in Asia. This topic has been the subject of much of Headrick's best work over the course of his career, and his mastery of the material comes through loud and clear. However much the Industrial Revolution transformed economic life in Europe and the United States in the nineteenth century, and in so doing improved living standards in the aggregate, the case was otherwise in much of the nonindustrializing world in the nineteenth century. The latter area, confronted with increasingly profound power asymmetries vis-à-vis the industrializing world, were routinely rendered into economic and political dependencies of the industrializing powers, and typically reduced to supplying raw materials and plantation commodities to Europe and the United States in exchange for manufactured goods and commercial/financial services. This reorientation wreaked environmental havoc on the nonindustrial world, including deforestation, the rise of monocultures and the loss of biodiversity, epidemics, and the intensification of droughts and flooding (particularly in the aftermath of El Niño–inspired weather events) because of ill-conceived or poorly executed irrigation projects.Headrick carries the story forward in chapters 10 and 11, detailing how industrialization, economic growth, population increase, wars, and mass consumption affected the environment all over the world in the twentieth century, straining the earth's carrying capacity, depleting and despoiling resources of all kinds, and spurring worrisome changes in climate, most notably greater weather variability and rising temperatures. So powerful were the environmental effects associated with industrialization, development, and the triumph worldwide of what might be called the ideology of developmentalism that many environmental writers argue that we have now entered a new geological age often referred to as the Anthropocene, highlighting the powerful role of humans in shaping and, in the eyes of most of these writers, ravaging the environment.In the last four chapters of Humans versus Nature Headrick discusses both the most salient environmental problems associated with humans' seemingly unceasing quest over the past two or three centuries for more development and the human responses these problems evoked. Here he must, of course, be selective in his coverage, but he wisely devotes space to issues relating to climate change in chapter 12, resource depletion (focusing on sea life) in chapter 13, the ominous threat of wholesale extinction of terrestrial species—what some refer to as the “Sixth Mass Extinction”—in chapter 14, and the rise of environmentalism across the globe in chapter 15. Headrick closes with a short, illuminating epilogue wherein he lays out several possible scenarios regarding what the future will hold for the increasingly fraught relationship between humans and nature, ending somberly by forewarning that “whatever happens, people may look back upon our age with envy” (473).Before raising a few caveats about Humans versus Nature, let me state for the record that I agree wholeheartedly with the overall assessment of the eminent environmental historian J. R. McNeill, who, in a back-cover blurb, calls Headrick's book “the most comprehensive environmental history in existence.” Moreover, I would add that Humans versus Nature is not only comprehensive, but also exceptionally well structured, up-to-date regarding scholarship, clearly written, and, as stated earlier, generally measured and balanced in its interpretations. In other words, the book should be considered a resounding success.This said—and said in all sincerity—I have questions regarding Headrick's rather blinkered depiction of humans and what I view as his overly critical view of their behavior toward nature over time. He is particularly critical of what he calls “our Paleolithic minds”—that is, of our will to dominate nature. But what is so wrong with attempting to shape and exercise control over nature, even of attempting to gain mastery over it? Where would we be had we settled for low-level equilibrium (“harmony”) with it? Why not try to set the terms?Humans' interest in “improving” nature and mobilizing it for our advantage goes way back. In both the Bible and the epic of Gilgamesh, for example, humans are charged with establishing dominion over the natural world. Indeed, one can argue that the process first began to take off well before then, when one of Homo sapiens' most creative predecessors, Homo erectus, began making systematic use of fire. It has been a long slog for humans ever since, but we have finally reached a position where larger and larger proportions of the human population are flourishing in a material sense, due to our ability to shape the environment in ways that enhance human welfare.Although Headrick and many of his scholarly confreres are distressed over what they view as an unhealthy and unsustainable relationship between humans and nature, humans, as a result of the Industrial Revolution and “developmentalism,” are by many measures now living in the wealthiest and healthiest age in our entire history, as Matt Ridley, Stephen Pinker, Hans Rosling, and Deirdre McCloskey, among others, have pointed out. And there is a lot of room for improvement in the human condition: I started this essay with some figures on global poverty. World income per capita in 2020, despite significant gains in recent decades, was still only about US$10,520 in constant (2010 dollar) terms—albeit somewhat higher in terms of PPP. So plenty of people could use more development.OK, but what about the relationship going forward between development and the environment? Some see demand for “environment”—that is, environmental services—as a superior good, rising more than proportionally vis-à-vis income, while others view it as a normal good. In either case we can expect demand for “environment” to increase. Per the so-called environmental Kuznets curve (EKC), as development makes individuals and countries richer, after a certain point they value environment more and more—and are increasingly willing to pay for it—which, ironically, renders environmental amelioration dependent at least in part on development.Certainly, we face a litany of serious environmental problems, but none of them is likely “existential,” not even climate change. Despite all the chatter about the depletion of this and the danger of that, one thing we are not short of is human ingenuity. Economist Julian L. Simon famously treated this matter long ago, focusing on what he called the “ultimate resource”: human imagination coupled with the human spirit.4 Headrick, almost in spite of himself, acknowledges this in Humans versus Nature, which is peppered with references to humans' flexibility, adaptability, creativity, drive, and so on. These are the features that got us where we are today—whether in a predicament or in what I see as an advantageous situation. If the past is any indication, we will likely not merely survive but thrive. If someone had asked experts in 1900, when world population was about 2 billion, if it would someday be possible for humans to produce sufficient food to feed 8 billion people—which number we are expected to reach as early as 2023—those experts would likely have considered the questioner daft. But we now produce sufficient food to feed 8 billion with a comfortable surplus left over. Development and developmentalism made that possible.In my view, some combination of R&D-induced reductions in the cost and improvements in the reliability of sustainable energy, innovations in carbon capture, and improvements in nuclear power technology—perhaps with some geoengineering wizardry thrown in—will get us through our climate problems. After all, flexible, adaptable, ingenious humans have weathered massive climate changes before. And what if I'm wrong (which I doubt) and groups such as Extinction Rebellion are right? Well, the earth survived the extinction of the dodo, last seen on the island of Mauritius in the late seventeenth century, and it will likely survive the eventual end of human life on Earth too. After all, as Headrick points out, “99.9 percent of all the species of living beings that ever inhabited the Earth have become extinct, making this a natural process” (403). That's where Elon Musk comes in. On to Mars—in a figurative sense at least!","",https://doi.org/10.1215/00021482-9825330,"",,
rayyan-220237665,Global monitoring of vegetation conditions and GPP from 30 years of passive microwave observations,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span&amp;gt;Microwave radiation emitted by the Earth surface is&amp;amp;#160;attenuated by vegetation. The magnitude of attenuation is commonly referred to as Vegetation Optical Depth (VOD) and depends on several factors, such as the water content of the vegetation and the wavelength of the sensor. It can be derived from space-borne microwave radiometers and has been explored for multiple applications including drought and biomass monitoring. Here, we present two&amp;amp;#160;novel applications based on long-term multi-satellite observations of VOD: 1) the Standardized VOD Index (SVODI) for&amp;amp;#160;monitoring vegetation condition and 2) modelling Gross Primary Production (VODCA2GPP). &amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#160;&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span&amp;gt;SVODI [1] is a standard normally distributed index indicating the condition of vegetation.&amp;amp;#160;Traditional index generation methods struggle to combine data from multiple data sources and often either exhibit a changing variance over time due to changing input sensors, or are biased. We solve these issues with a new probabilistic merging method, which in principle can be applied to other datasets as well. We show that SVODI, which is an indicator of vegetation structure, biomass and water content, supplements existing vegetation condition indexes based on optical data, which mostly represent the greenness of the vegetation. In the presentation, we also assess spatio-temporal patterns and trends of extreme SVODI values.&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#160;&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span&amp;gt;VODCA2GPP [2] is a global GPP dataset derived from VOD using a sink-driven approach. It uses a machine learning framework using the VOD Climate Archive (VODCA), a long-term coherent dataset based on multiple sensors [3], in combination with FLUXNET in situ GPP observations to predict GPP at a global scale for a period of 30 years. VODCA2GPP exhibits similar spatial and temporal patterns as existing observation-based global GPP datasets from FLUXCOM and MODIS, but with a consistent positive bias. While VODCA2GPP reveals no significant global trend, it does show several regional trends, some of which corroborate trends found in the TRENDY model ensemble.&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#160;&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span&amp;gt;Both datasets are available for free from open data repositories.&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#160;&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span&amp;gt;[1]&amp;amp;#160;Moesinger, L., Zotta, R.M., van der Schalie, R.,&amp;amp;#160;Scanlon, T., de Jeu, R.A.M., Dorigo, W.&amp;amp;#160;Monitoring Vegetation Condition using Microwave Remote Sensing: The Standardized Vegetation Optical Depth Index SVODI, in rev.&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#160;&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span&amp;gt;[2] Wild, B., Teubner, I., Moesinger, L., Zotta, R.-M., Forkel, M., van der Schalie, R., Sitch, S., Dorigo, W.

Flowing through Guinea, Mali, Senegal and Mauritania, the Senegal River (fig 1) is a strategic water resource for the West-Africa region and riparian countries development. The Senegal River's water management in time and space is possible thanks to the existing and planned hydroelectric dams built along the river. These water developments aim to meet the growing water, food and energy needs of the member states (Senegal, Mali, Guinea, Mauritania). Access to energy and food security will be a significant challenge in the future due to population growth and climate change. In the coming decades, climate change and changes in land use and land cover will further increase the constraints on the already scarce water resources in the Sudano-Sahelian zone of West Africa.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This study is part of the Nexus &amp;quot;Climate change, LULC change, Water, Energy&amp;quot; in the Senegal River basin. The objective is to assess the impact of climate change and land use/land cover on water resources in the upper Senegal River basin and associated socio-economic activities (energy, agriculture, flood support, flood control) for the time horizon 2050. This study aims to develop simulations of streamflow and water storage under assumptions of LULC and climate change for integrated management of dams in a multiple-use context.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Our methodology is based on A multi-model approach including a climate model, a land use/land cover forecasting model (land change modeler) for modelling and elaborating future land use/land cover maps (2050) based on past trends (1986, 2006 and 2020) of LULC map, a hydrological model (Swim) for modelling runoff and projecting flows to 2050, and a

rayyan-220237813,Earth System Deep Learning towards a Global Digital Twin of Wildfires,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Due to climate change, we expect an exacerbation of fire in Europe and around the world, with major wildfire events extending to northern latitudes and boreal regions [1]. In this context, it is important to improve our capabilities to anticipate fire danger and understand its driving mechanisms at a global scale. As the earth is an interconnected system, large-scale processes can have an effect on the global climate and fire seasons. For example, extreme fires in Siberia have been linked to previous-year surface moisture conditions and anomalies in the Arctic Oscillation [2]. As part of the ESA-funded project SeasFire (https://seasfire.hua.gr), we gather and harmonize data related to seasonal fire drivers and develop deep learning models that are able to capture spatiotemporal associations with the goal to forecast burned area sizes on a seasonal scale, globally. We publish a global analysis-ready datacube for seasonal fire forecasting for the years 2001-2021 at a spatiotemporal resolution of 0.25 deg x 0.25 deg x 8 days [3]. The datacube includes a combination of variables describing the seasonal fire drivers , namely climate, vegetation, oceanic indices, human factors, land cover and the burned areas. We leverage the availability of big EO data and the advances in Deep Learning modeling [4, 5] to forecast global burned areas, capture the spatio-temporal interactions of the Earth System variables and identify potential teleconnections that determine wildfire regimes under the light of climate change. We present deep learning models that handle the Earth as a system, such as graph neural networks and transformer-based architectures. Applied on the prediction of wildfires at different temporal horizons we reveal that our deep learning models&amp;#160; skillfully predict burned area patterns. Exploring the explanation of the models, we reveal important spatio-temporal links.Our approach, using AI to model the earth as a system and capture long spatio-temporal interactions, showcases the potential of an application-specific digital twin. The SeasFire datacube can be exploited as a baseline digital twin for modeling different natural hazards, including floods, heatwaves, and droughts. Thus, we will discuss insights and future directions for digital twins in anticipating climate extremes, inspired by our global wildfire prediction paradigm.&amp;#160;&amp;#160;[1] Wu, Chao, et al.

rayyan-220237857,Global Diversity in Cultural Ecosystem Services in Protected Areas: A Social Media and Deep Learning Analysis,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Protected areas (PAs) are the cornerstone of conservation efforts. Although they provide many benefits to humanity, the variability in the provision of cultural ecosystem services (CES) among global PAs as a function of their ecological and social context remains unknown. To investigate this, we combined Convolutional Neural Networks with hierarchical clustering to label and group photos from Flickr taken in PAs worldwide. A final sample of 87,090 photos in 2,813 PAs within 207 countries was obtained. Distinct global patterns of CES activities emerged. Such activities mainly consisted of three key interaction types: human-nature (abiotic), human-nature (biotic) and human-human. Human-nature (both abiotic and biotic) and human-human interactions were observed, with human-nature (abiotic) interactions in mountain ranges dominating. Human-nature (biotic) photos were more common in equatorial countries, and human-human photos occurred mainly in Europe. To determine the extent that such similarities in CES were also influenced by the diversity of physical environments of PAs, mixed-effects models were subsequently run. These models considered the effect of biome differences among PAs in influencing each CES type while noting the country that each PA is in as a random effect. Despite having differences in their physical environments, PAs within each country were generally found to share similar CES types. More strikingly, it was discovered that the effect of biome differences across PAs on all CES types was marginal, thereby demonstrating that country-level management of PAs likely has a more important role in influencing CES activities in PAs. To conclude, we suggest that our results demonstrate the utility of social media data for understanding visitor activities in PAs. Hence, we propose that local governments can consider using social media when monitoring land use patterns in PAs, thereby ensuring more effective conservation.","",https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4591608,"",,
rayyan-220237871,Pluto: A global volcanic activity early warning system powered by large scale self-supervised deep learning on InSAR data,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Artificial intelligence (AI) methods have emerged as a powerful tool to study and in some cases forecast natural disasters [1,2]. Recent works have successfully combined deep learning modeling with scientific knowledge stemming from the SAR Interferometry domain propelling research on tasks like volcanic activity monitoring [3], associated with ground deformation. A milestone in this interdisciplinary field has been the release of the Hephaestus [4] InSAR dataset, facilitating automatic InSAR interpretation, volcanic activity localization as well as the detection and categorization of atmospheric contributions in wrapped interferograms. Hephaestus contains annotations for approximately 20,000 InSAR frames, covering the 44 most active volcanoes in the world. The annotation was performed&amp;#160; by a team of InSAR experts that manually examined each InSAR frame individually. However, even with such a large dataset, class imbalance remains a challenge, i.e. the InSAR samples containing volcano deformation fringes are orders of magnitude less than those that do not. This is anticipated since natural hazards are in principle rare in nature. To counter that, the authors of Hephaestus provide more than 100,000 unlabeled InSAR frames to be used for global large-scale self-supervised learning, which is more robust to class imbalance when compared to supervised learning [5].&amp;#160;Motivated by the Hephaestus dataset and the insights provided by [2], we train global, task-agnostic models in a self-supervised learning fashion that can handle distribution shifts caused by spatio-temporal variability as well as major class imbalances. By finetuning such a model to the labeled part of Hephaestus we obtain the backbone for a global volcanic activity alerting system, namely Pluto. Pluto is a novel end-to-end AI based system that provides early warnings of volcanic unrest on a global scale.Pluto automatically synchronizes its database with the Comet-LiCS [6] portal to receive newly generated Sentinel-1 InSAR data acquired over volcanic areas. The new samples are fed to our volcanic activity detection model. If volcanic activity is detected, an automatic email is sent to the service users, which contains information about the intensity, the exact location and the type (Mogi, Sill, Dyk) of the event. To ensure a robust and ever-improving service we augment Pluto with an iterative pipeline that collects samples that were misclassified in production, and uses them to further improve the existing model.&amp;#160;&amp;#160;[1] Kondylatos et al.

rayyan-220237905,Land Cover Mapping Using Semantic Segmentation Models,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Land cover mapping is the process of creating a map that shows the types of land cover in a given area. This includes vegetation, land use, surface features, and other natural and human-made features. Land cover mapping is used to help understand environmental processes, land use, and land management. It also helps identify potential risks from natural disasters, such as floods and landslides. By understanding land cover, land managers can make decisions about how to best use and manage the land. Deep learning has opened up new opportunities for the extraction of LC information from remotely sensed imagery.. Deep learning models are typically applied to satellite imagery and aerial photographs, which are then analyzed with the help of convolutional neural networks (CNNs). CNNs are able to accurately identify and classify land cover types in high-resolution imagery. In this paper we have implemented 3 Semantic Segmentation models namely PSPNet, UNet and FPN on the DeepGlobe dataset for land cover mapping. We have achieved IoU scores of 91%, 78% and 64% respectively.","",https://doi.org/10.1109/iccubea58933.2023.10392136,"",,
rayyan-220237935,Spatio-Temporal Change Detection Model For Deforestation Analysis Using Advanced Deep Learning Approaches,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Satellite imagery is widely available in this era of internet. Satellite images are available in multispectral, hyperspectral images, Lidar data form, and other types of imaging dataset are also available. Huge information exists in these imageries. In this study, multispectral optical satellite images are used. These images have spectral, spatial, and temporal properties. This data has velocity, volume and variety. Though enough research is available to process this type of data, as this data is a Bigdata, the processing and analysis of these images is compute intensive, there are research challenges in solving the problems associated with this domain. This research study explores the classification accuracy of change detection and compute time efficiency for processing huge satellite imaging datasets.As a use case for this research, the spatio-temporal change detection for deforestation detection employing top tree canopy has been chosen. We have considered one of India's densely populated metropolitan areas, Mumbai, which has several industrial areas, and rapidly expanding population. As a result of the growing urbanization, the tree canopy of the area is gradually decreasing. We have chosen this deforestation analysis, and addressed accuracy and compute performance for the satellite imagery dataset as a research problem.This research has following major two contributions:a)Dataset creation for Mumbai region from Sentinel 2 dataset of 2500 images.b)The Spatio-Temporal Change Detection (STCD) model, explores the hybrid approach using transfer learning and self-attention models for better accuracy and improved compute performance for deforestation change detection with tree canopy.","",https://doi.org/10.1109/igarss52108.2023.10282606,"",,
rayyan-220237944,Land cover classification of Andean sub-basins in Colombia based on Sentinel-2 satellite images and deep learning,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"The Las Piedras River sub-basin, located in the department of Cauca, Colombia, is very important for the region, especially for the capital (Popayán). This is because this sub-basin contributes around 68.17% of the water supply for the city. To guarantee continuity of this resource, good management of the Water Ecosystem Services (WES) must be carried out. To this aim, periodic environmental assessments of the water resource in the region are necessary. Such Environmental Assessment WES (EAWES) is possible when an accurate and up-to-date land cover map is available. However, obtaining such a product is quite complex due to the heterogeneous conditions both in the land cover and orography of the studied region. Another impacting factor is the weather conditions of the region, that make it difficult to access the areas and/or to acquire information for land cover mapping. This research proposes a robust model, based on deep learning and Sentinel2 satellite images, able to perform a land cover classification with reliable accuracy (>90%) at a low computational cost. A variant of a LeNet convolutional neural network has been used together with features extracted from original spectral bands, radiometric indices and a digital elevation map. Preliminary results show an overall accuracy of 95.49% in the training data and 96.51% in the validation one.","",https://doi.org/10.1117/12.2664340,"",,

However, modeling dryland carbon and water fluxes with remote sensing suffers from unique challenges not typically encountered in mesic systems, particularly in capturing soil moisture stress. Here, we develop and evaluate an approach for joint modeling of dryland gross primary production (GPP), net ecosystem exchange (NEE), and evapotranspiration (ET) in the western United States (U.S.) using a suite of AmeriFlux eddy covariance sites spanning major functional types and aridity regimes. We use artificial neural networks (ANNs) to predict dryland ecosystem fluxes by fusing optical vegetation indices, multitemporal thermal observations, and microwave soil moisture/temperature retrievals from the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) sensor. Our new dryland ANN (DrylANNd) carbon and water flux model explains more than 70% of monthly variance in GPP and ET, improving upon existing MODIS GPP and ET estimates at most dryland eddy covariance sites. DrylANNd predictions of NEE were considerably worse than its predictions of GPP and ET, likely because soil and plant respiratory processes are largely invisible to satellite sensors. Optical vegetation indices, particularly the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and near-infrared reflectance of vegetation (NIRv), were generally the most important variables contributing to model skill. However, daytime and nighttime land surface temperatures and SMAP soil moisture and soil temperature also contributed to model skill, with SMAP especially improving model predictions of shrubland, grassland, and savanna fluxes and land surface temperatures improving predictions in evergreen needleleaf forests. Our results show that a combination of optical vegetation indices, thermal infrared, and microwave observations can substantially improve estimates of carbon and water fluxes in drylands, potentially providing the means to better monitor vegetation function and ecosystem services in these important regions that are undergoing rapid hydroclimatic change.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu23-1824,"",,
rayyan-220238058,Agricultural Technologies,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Provisioning food and nutritional security for India's 1.4 billion population is a challenge and requires robust agricultural research and extension mechanism to address the complex issues. Further, India has only 2.4% and 4% of global land and water availability, respectively with which it should support 17.5% of the world population. From the position of 'begging bowl' for its 330 million population in the 1950s, India not only became food secure for its ~1.4 billion current population but became a net exporter of food grains. While there was a 5.6 times increase in food grain production since independence, there was also a substantial increase in the production of pulses (3 times), oilseed (5 times), cotton (11.4 times), sugarcane (6.6 times), milk (9.7 times), fish (15.2 times), egg (47.5 times), etc. Except for the British period, there was a steady increase in the development of agricultural technology and subsequent production of agricultural and allied enterprises over the centuries. Scientific integration of crops and livestock, along with the concept of manuring and irrigation, has existed since Indus Valley Civilization. After the Independence, there was enormous growth in the agricultural sector and food production due to different pioneer schemes of the Government of India like Grow More Food Campaign and Integrated Production Program. The introduction of high-yielding varieties (HYVs), fertilizer, provision of irrigation, and improved agronomic practices resulted in the Green revolution in the 1960s and enhanced food grain production significantly over the years. The creation of the Department of Agricultural Research and Education (DARE), Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), and Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK) are the important milestones in Indian agriculture to get operation flood, yellow revolution, blue revolution, etc. Development of HYVs and hybrids of different agricultural and horticultural crops, a scientific package of practices for cultivation of crops, livestock, fisheries, and allied enterprises, availability of farm implements, post harvesting and processing technologies, supply on quality inputs like manures, fertilizer, pesticides, etc. and availability of institutional credit and procurement of produce further strengthen the Indian agriculture. Remote sensing technology is widely used for crop yield estimation, area expansion under specific crops in order to forecast the district/ regional level productivity, and also used to provide crop insurance to farmers for crop loss due to climatic or biotic stress. The use of no-till technology along with drip or sprinkler irrigation is the need of the hour for conserving our scarce natural resources and enhancing productivity and income. While biotechnology and genetic engineering have resulted in the development of varieties with pest resistance and increased crop yields, farm mechanization has led to efficient tilling, harvesting, water use, and a reduction in manual labor requirements. The development of location-specific different integrated farming systems (IFS) or integrated organic farming system (IOFS) models also helped enhance resource use efficiency, system productivity, and income of farmers. The use of information and communication technology and weather-based agro-advisories also help farmers' preparedness for forthcoming sporadic extreme weather events such as flash floods, drought, or pest outbreaks. The Indian population is slated to grow to about 1.7 billion by 2050. Food production has to be increased in the context of worsening land and water scarcity, soil degradation, multinutrient deficiency, and climate-change-related extreme weather events. The challenge is to find ways and means to produce enough quality to ensure food and nutritional security without deteriorating the environment. The challenge of producing more from reduced area and water under agriculture and minimizing post-harvest losses will have a major impact on agricultural development. Digital smart agriculture with the use of artificial intelligence, blockchain, remote sensing and GIS technology, use of drones and robots, etc. may take Indian agriculture to the next paradigm.","",https://doi.org/10.1007/978-981-19-7997-2_4,"",,
rayyan-220238081,Deep learning for downscaling tropical cyclone rainfall,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Flood hazards from Tropical cyclones (TCs) are frequently the leading cause of mortality and damages. Current research indicates that TC rainfall will increase by 7 % per degree of ocean warming with a greater proportion of them being extreme . It is vital to understand how this increase in rainfall will translate to flood risk from tropical cyclones by first accurately modelling TC rainfall under present climatic conditions.General circulation models struggle to reproduce TC rainfall fields so downscaling models are often used to generate more realistic TC rainfall data. Increasingly, rainfall downscaling studies have adopted deep learning techniques from the Computer Vision field to achieve comparable results to traditional methods at a fraction of the computational cost. Initially, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), specifically U-NETs, showed promise in precipitation downscaling. But more recently, the use of Generative models has been explored following the success of GANs in classical image super-resolution problems compared to CNNs. Generative approaches have shown potential at reproducing the fine spatial detail and stochastic nature of precipitation.Here, we develop upon the WGAN and Variational Autoencoder GAN (VAEGAN) from Harris et al. (2022) and apply it to rainfall data from TCs to increase the resolution of rainfall measurements from 100 km resolution to 10 km resolution.Overall, the Wasserstein GAN, performed better than other methods, the variational autoencoder GAN, U-Net and bilinear interpolation, across all diagnostics explored. We showed that for regular TCs the WGAN had the most realistic power spectra for all wave numbers, closely followed by the VAEGAN which only deviated for scales of around 5 pixels or fewer. The U-Net and Bilinear Interpolation methods both reproduced power spectra poorly compared to observations, with significant differences present from wave numbers greater than 3. We found that the WGAN had the lowest mean bias overall with errors around the core of the TC within 5 % error, while the VAEGAN had a dry bias of over 5 % outside of the inner core region. Both models had a low negative bias in standard deviation of between 0-5 %.When looking at the 100 most extreme samples, beyond the intensity of storms used in training the models, the WGAN is able to produce results of similar quality to those for TCs of intensities used in training, except for predictions having too low spread. This indicates that if the WGAN were trained on the full observational dataset, it could perform well for storms more intense than those previously observed, which is important for judging the model's robustness. Conversely, the power spectra of the VAEGAN became more unrealistic and predictions more artificial. There were some very large errors present in VAEGAN at the upper end of the extreme test set which demonstrates the importance of evaluating models on the most extreme, unseen, cases. &amp;#160;Overall, these results show that generative approaches have the potential to generate TC rainfall fields with a high degree of accuracy.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu23-8325,"",,

Due to its ecological and economic significance, the Sundarbans Delta is a crucial tidal- influenced region for Bangladesh and India. The study used a Random Forest machine learning technique to assess the land use and land cover (LULC) changes of the low-lying Sundarbans delta, and it used a Cellular Automata approach combined with an Artificial Neural Network (CA-ANN) to model LULC. The accuracy of both user and producer ranges from 100-85% for the Mangrove and 100-79% for the surrounding waterbodies. Results show that over the decades, the thick, dense mangrove coverage of the Sundarbans has receded while the width of the intricate network of channels has increased, and the spatial coverage of water bodies has risen. The spatial vegetation index shows that the average minimum Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) for all months from 1990 to 2020 is not consistent, varying from -0.72 to 0.85. The month of November has the lowest negative NDVI (-0.716), while June has the least low negative NDVI (-0.48). This negative NDVI primarily indicates the extent and severity of flooding in the Sundarbans Delta during the monsoon season. In 1970, the mangrove coverage was at 65%, but by 2020 it had dropped to 59%. In the period between 1990 and 2015, the coverage of channels in the Sundarbans increased from 33% to 43%. The study also showed that built-up and barren land areas were slowly increasing. Water bodies were encroaching on the mangrove forest, which could be due to rising sea levels or deforestation. The analysis revealed that mangroves in the Sundarbans Delta have decreased from 65% to 59% of the total area of the delta during the study period. Temporary human settlements were also visible in the area. The most significant changes were seen in the southern part of the delta, which is more vulnerable to sea level rise. The water bodies fluctuated across the mangrove forests because many rivers and channels crisscross the Sundarbans delta. Future simulation for the years 2030-2050 revealed a decline in mangrove coverage from about 63.5% to 56.7%, while the total area of water bodies will increase from 33.9% to 39.8%.

rayyan-220238231,USCC: A Benchmark Dataset for Crop Yield Prediction under Climate Extremes,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Climate variability and extremes are known to represent major causes for crop yield anomalies. They can lead to the reduction of crop productivity, which results in disruptions in food availability and nutritional quality, as well as in rising food prices. Extreme climates will become even more severe as global warming proceeds, challenging the achievement of food security. These extreme events, especially droughts and heat waves, are already evident in major food-production regions like the United States. Crops cultivated in this country such as corn and soybean are critical for both domestic use and international supply. Considering the sensitivity of crops to climate, here we present a dataset that couples remote sensing surface reflectances with climate variables (e.g. minimum and maximum temperature, precipitation, and vapor pressure) and extreme indicators. The dataset contains the crop yields of various commodities over the USA for nearly two decades. Given the advances and proven success of machine learning in numerous remote sensing tasks, our dataset constitutes a benchmark to advance the development of novel models for crop yield prediction, and to analyze the relationship between climate and crop yields for gaining scientific insights. Other potential use cases include extreme event detection and climate forecasting from satellite imagery.

Terrace abandonment affects the soil quality, soil and water conservation benefits, and biodiversity of terraces. Therefore, it is important to quantify the number and spatial distribution of abandoned terraces to protect cultivated land and food security. However, the traditional remote sensing method cannot identify small plots and make accurate assessment of abandoned farmland quickly in mountainous areas. To accurately identifying abandoned terraces, this study used semantic segmentation based on deep learning and change detection to identify abandoned terraces and their spatial distribution in a small watershed on the Loess Plateau in 2021. A comparative analysis of the accuracy of three deep learning models revealed that RefineNet is superior to DeepLabv3+ and DeepLabv3 for identifying abandoned terraces. The user's accuracy, producer's accuracy, overall accuracy, and appa values for RefineNet were 0.817, 0.894, 0.800, and 0.539, respectively. For change detection, the corresponding values were 0.821, 0.753, 0.731, and 0.426, respectively. In addition, semantic segmentation produced better recognition results than change detection in complex terrain and geomorphological areas. The abandoned terraces in the study area were mainly distributed in mountainous areas far from residential areas and more likely at high elevations with large slopes. This study provides a new method for recognizing abandoned terraces and spatial distribution information for managing and utilizing abandoned terraces.","",https://doi.org/10.1002/ldr.4612,"",,

rayyan-220238363,Quantifying Tree-species Specific Responses to the Extreme 2022 Drought in Germany,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"In recent decades, forests are increasingly suffering from so-called hotter droughts. This is because rising temperatures increase the atmospheric water demand under drought, thereby amplifying plant-water consumption. As a consequence, soil-water potentials are reaching more extreme values which eventually may result in xylem cavitation and possibly tree die-back. For instance, the extreme 2018 drought resulted in extraordinary die-back frequencies in numerous tree species across Central Europe such as European beech, Norway spruce, and Scots pine. Since forests render an important agent in terms of climate change mitigation, increasing forests' climate-change resilience via forest conversion is essential to preserve their integrity and consequently ecosystem services related to carbon sequestration.&amp;#160;In this context, better knowledge of species-specific drought responses is highly valuable since it allows for determining critical drought thresholds beyond which the functional integrity of trees is at threat. Such knowledge may serve to parameterize dynamic vegetation models, which then can be deployed to project tree-species-specific performance under various climate change scenarios. Eventually, this may guide forest managers to select more climate-resilient tree species portfolios in terms of forest conversion.&amp;#160;Yet, species-specific drought responses are typically derived from plot-based physiological monitoring networks. While this approach provides valuable and highly precise data on tree physiology and it suffers from a relatively low replication. To overcome this low-spatial replication, large-scale assessments using satellite-based remote sensing appear a promising research avenue. For instance, the recently released European forest condition monitor (EFCM) provides information on forest canopy conditions in near real-time, which was shown to successfully quantify drought impacts under previous droughts (Buras et al., 2020, 2021). However, the EFCM currently does not allow for species-specific assessments given a lack of corresponding data, in particular tree-species classifications.&amp;#160;To overcome this research gap and to deepen our knowledge of species-specific drought responses, we here present a machine-learning-based tree-species classification using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) of Germany which is subsequently used to stratify EFCM data to quantify the species-specific response of most abundant tree-species (in particular beech, oak, spruce, and pine) to the extreme 2022 drought. Preliminary results indicated a successful calibration-validation of the tree-species classification, with the corresponding F1-scores in the order of 0.55 &amp;#8211; 0.7 and true-skill statistics in the order of 0.6 &amp;#8211; 0.78, indicating average to good performance. Once applied to stratify the EFCM data we provide a well-replicated large-scale assessment of tree-species-specific drought response, which will improve our understanding of species-specific climate-change resilience.

rayyan-220238381,Effect of socioeconomic variables in predicting global wildfire ignition occurrence,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Wildfires are a pervasive feature of the terrestrial biosphere and contribute large carbon emissions within the Earth system. Humans are responsible for the majority of wildfire ignitions. Physical and empirical models are used to estimate the effects of fires on vegetation dynamics and the Earth system. However, there is no consensus on how human-caused fire ignitions should be represented in such models.&amp;#160; &amp;#160;We aim to identify which globally available predictors of human activity explain global fire ignitions as observed by satellites. We apply a random forest machine learning framework to state-of-the-art global climate, vegetation, and land cover datasets to predict global fire ignition density remote sensing data. We establish a baseline against which influences of socioeconomic data (cropland fraction, gross domestic product (GDP), road density, livestock density, and grazed lands) are evaluated to determine their effects on fire ignition occurrence predictions. Our results show that a baseline random forest without human predictors captures the spatial patterns of fire ignitions globally but overestimates ignition occurrence, with the highest predictions over Sub-Saharan Africa and South East Asia. Adding human predictors one by one to the baseline model reveals that human variables vary in their effects on fire ignitions, and GDP is the most vital driver of fire ignitions. We also find that high road density leads to decreased ignitions globally despite improved environmental access, mainly because these regions are primarily human settlements and will have fewer fires. A combined model with all human predictors shows that the human variables improve the ignition predictions in most areas of the world; still, some regions, e.g., East Africa, have worse predictions than the baseline model. &amp;#160; We conclude that an ensemble of human predictors can add value to physical and empirical models. There are complex relationships between the variables, as evidenced by the improvement in bias in the combined model compared to the individual models.&amp;#160; Furthermore, the variables tested have complex relationships that random forests may struggle to disentangle. &amp;#160;Further work is needed to reach concrete conclusions at a global scale, but rather introduce the need for additional work to detangle the complex regional relationships between these variables, particularly across Central and Eastern Africa, where the full model performs poorly despite the high availability of fire ignition data.&amp;#160;","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu23-13976,"",,
rayyan-220238385,Convolutional Neural Networks Regression Model with Uncertainty Estimates to predict GEDI Canopy height at 30m resolution using multisource SAR and optical observations,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Accurate estimates of forest aboveground biomass (AGB) are essential for assessing forest carbon stocks and their change over time to support policies for climate change mitigation, resource management, and biodiversity conservation. Among the methodologies to estimate AGB, those that include accurate forest canopy height (CH) information present better estimates due to the direct relationship between AGB and CH. Therefore, to cover large areas, Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) remote sensing technology is preferred because it can provide highly accurate and precise measurements of the distance from the ground to the top of the canopy. However, developing continuous acquisition campaigns using LiDAR technology at continental scales at high-spatial resolution is too expensive. &amp;#160; The Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) offers a unique opportunity to overcome this challenge. The GEDI mission uses a laser instrument mounted on the International Space Station (ISS) to measure the distance from the ISS to the Earth&amp;#8217;s surface with high accuracy and spatial resolution. However, GEDI does not provide a spatially continuous CH map. Instead, it captures 25 m spatial resolution footprint samples over the Earth&amp;#8217;s surface following a sparse-grid-based sampling pattern between 51.6&amp;#176; N and 51.6&amp;#176; S. In this acquisition setup, the samples are spaced every 60 m in the along-track direction and 600 m in the across-track direction. &amp;#160; To estimate CH for areas not covered by the sparse GEDI mission, we propose a non-linear mapping function using Convolutional Neural Networks with Uncertainty estimates (UCNNs) with input data from other satellites and output a continuous estimate of&amp;#160;CH with a measure of uncertainty. Specifically, we use coregistered multitemporal data from Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, and ALOS PALSAR. From Sentinel imagery, we use bimonthly composites each year from April-May, June-July, and August-September to capture the dynamics of the spectral and structural tree information in Canada. From ALOS PALSAR, we use the one-year composite, and from GEDI data, we use strong-beam samples from June to July from the corresponding year, while excluding all low-quality samples. Experiments were conducted for 2020 in the Province of Ontario, Canada, whose climate is considered continental, with temperatures ranging from humid in the south, with cold winters and warm summers, to sub-Arctic in the north. To avoid overfitting, we apply spatial cross-validation splitting the study region into five non-overlapping areas. The cumulative uncertainty histogram shows that 90% of samples present an uncertainty of&amp;#160;CH less than 5 meters. These results are the first step towards spatially continuous mapping of canopy height using multitemporal and multisource satellite data, with implications for improving assessment of forest biomass estimation and carbon monitoring from space.&amp;#160;","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu23-10091,"",,

The MLP-ANN model was employed to analyze the impact of elevation and proximity to road networks (i.e., exploratory maps) on changes in LULC from 2017 to 2021. The predicted 2021 LULC map shows a high correlation to the actual LULC map of 2021, with a kappa index of 0.91 and a 96.68% accuracy. The MLP-ANN model was applied to project LULC changes in the future (i.e., 2030 and 2050). The results suggest that in 2030, the built-up area and trees are increasing by 4.50% and 2.31%, respectively. Unfortunately, water will decrease upto 0.34% and crops is about to decrease by approximately 3.25%. In the year 2050, the built-up area will continue to increase up to 6.89%, while water and crops decreases by 0.53% and 3.32%, respectively. Overall, the results show that human anthropogenic activities influence the land's alterations. Moreover, the study illustrates how machine learning models can generate a reliable future scenario of land usage changes.","",https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4374371,"",,

Regrettably, a substantial 64–71% of wetlands have been lost worldwide since 1900, mainly due to changes in land use and land cover (LULC). This issue is not unique to Zambia's Bangweulu Wetland, which faces similar challenges. However, there is limited information about the LULC changes in Bangweulu Wetland. Furthermore, finding accurate and cost-effective methods to understand LULC dynamics is complicated by the multitude of available techniques for LULC classification. Non-parametric methods like Machine Learning (ML) offer greater accuracy, but different ML models come with distinct strengths and weaknesses. Combining multiple models has the potential to create a more precise LULC classification model. Open-source software like QGIS and spatial data like Landsat also play a significant role in this endeavour. The primary objective of this study was to enhance the accuracy of modeling LULC changes in wetland areas. A Quad hybrid model, which combined the best selected models: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naive Bayes (NB), Decision Tree (DT) and K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN), was used for LULC classification using Landsat 8 (2020 image) and Landsat 5 (1990, 2000, and 2010 images) in QGIS. Results revealed that the fusion of classified maps of the SVM, NB, DT, and KNN (Quad hybrid model) showcased superior performance compared to the individual models with Kappa Index scores of 0.87, 0.72, 0.84 and 0.87 for the years 1990, 2000, 2010 and 2020, respectively. The analysis of the LULC changes from 1990 to 2020 showed a yearly decline of -1.17%, -1.01%, and -0.12% in forest, grassland, and water body coverage, respectively. In contrast, built-up areas and cropland increased at rates of 1.70% and 2.70%, respectively. This study underscores the consistent growth of cropland and built-up areas from 1990 to 2020, alongside the reduction of forest cover and grassland. Although the water body experienced a gradual decrease over this period, the decline was minimal. Long-term monitoring will be essential for evaluating the success of interventions, guiding conservation efforts, mitigating negative impacts on the wetland ecosystem, and determining whether the reduction in water is a sustained trend or a short-term phenomenon.","",https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4626990,"",,
rayyan-220238489,Detection of Biodiversity Indicators for Regenerative Agriculture Compliance,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Regenerative agriculture certification requires rigorous and periodic inspection of adoption of recommended principles on the field. One of the key principles of Regenerative agriculture is to follow multi-cropping, which results in conservation of biodiversity. In our study, we demonstrate a method for detection of multi-cropping in a farm using remote sensing data and machine learning based models. We define classification problem with 4 classes: A. Mono-cropping - single crop fields, B. Mono-cropping - single tree-species plantations, C. Multi-cropping - single crop with trees, and D. Multi-cropping - agroforestry with multiple crop and multiple tree species. For all these classes, ground truth data has been created through manual annotation of the fields. Remote sensing satellite images of 10m resolution from Sentinel-2A have been used as an input data for classification. We present the results obtained by experimenting with Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) models with manual and AutoML based training. Using the proposed approach, the number of visits for assessment of regenerative agriculture compliance can be reduced significantly, which will further reduce the certification cost and hence the overall cost of agricultural produce.","",https://doi.org/10.1109/metroagrifor58484.2023.10424282,"",,
rayyan-220238490,Application of Artificial Intelligence in AgroWeb,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Technology has reconceived farming over the years, and technological advances have affected agriculture in multiple ways. Agriculture is one of the oldest and mainstay occupations in many countries around the world. According to United Nations (UN) estimates, there will be 9.8 billion people on the planet in 2051 and 13.2 billion in 2500. The UN Food and Agriculture Organization projects that by 2050, we would need to produce 60% more food to infuse a global population of 10.8 billion people. Our natural resources will be heavily taxed if farming is done as normal. This is driving farmers and agri-based company to identify new ways to increase production. As a result, the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning based on agriculture will lead to high production. Artificial intelligence will not only enable farmers to improve efficiency but also increase the quantity, quality, and growth of crops. The main concern is to audit various applications in agriculture, such as crop yield predictions, price stock monitoring, intelligent spraying, predictive plantation, crop and soil monitoring, weather forecasting, diagnosis of diseases, and agribots. Because of global warming, the temperature of Earth changes continuously, resulting in alterations to the climate and an increase in population. Farmers can select which type of crop to plant and the ideal time to seed the crop with the use of AI applications, which can help them with this challenge. In agriculture, the type of soil and the nutrients contained in the soil have an important impact on crop productivity and value. The quality of soil and the nutrients it contains have declined as a result of increased deforestation. This makes it difficult for farmers to decide which crop to plant and how much fertilizer to use, which can be overcome by developing AI applications that can detect pests and illnesses, as well as nutritional deficiencies in the soil, giving farmers advice on the best pesticides to apply. The technology for picture recognition can help with this task. The farmers capture the images and identify the disease. Every day, farms produce lakhs of data points on temperature, weather, soil nature, moisture, water condition, and usage of water. Artificial intelligence applications can be developed to help farmers avoid inaccurate farming and by offering appropriate advice on water management, crop rotation, harvesting time, the type of crop to be cultivated, insect assaults, and the appropriate fertilizer to use. Farmers may practice managed farming, and AI drones can help in proper layout in farming. Machine learning and AI can be used to monitor stock prices to increase farmers' profits. Artificial intelligence in agriculture not only automates farmers but also increases crop yield and production, which can meet the needs of the world. The AI AgroWeb is a multi-problem solver for farmers.","",https://doi.org/10.1201/9781003400110-5,"",,
rayyan-220238506,Farmland Quality Assessment Using Deep Learning and Uavs,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"The transformation of agricultural landscapes due to the intensification of farming practices has placed a major threat on habitat and species diversity. A fundamental task of the scientific community in stopping and reversing this process, is to find appropriate monitoring methods. These are intended to show political decision-makers where urgent action is needed and to evaluate the effectiveness of the measures implemented. While traditional methods of field-based biodiversity monitoring are time consuming and expensive, recent advances in remote sensing and machine learning provide an opportunity to develop more systematic, sustainable and cost-effective monitoring methods. Accordingly, this study investigated whether large-scale biodiversity monitoring campaigns such as the European Monitoring of Biodiversity in Agricultural Landscapes (EMBAL) could be supported by the use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) based remote sensing and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). For this purpose, the Structural Nature Value (SNV) indicator was proposed, which allows an intuitive estimation of the species diversity of landscape sections. Subsequently, a CNN was trained to predict the SNV. For the accuracy assessment, a survey was conducted in which participants were asked to assess the SNV for various landscape patches, both to obtain an independent test set, and to evaluate the intuitiveness of the concept. The CNN achieved a mean weighted F1-score of 0.81 with an overall accuracy of 81 %. It was shown that the CNN can provide promising results to not only aid large-scale biodiversity monitorings, but to enhance the quality of their results through the automated analysis of fine-resolution UAV imagery.","",https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4516387,"",,

While our understanding of the general importance of these coral reefs as reservoirs of biodiversity is commonly accepted, attempts at quantifying how many species live in the oceans, or on coral reefs, is a much more complex question to answer. Our best attempts to put concrete numbers on total marine biodiversity have produced wildly discrepant numbers that differ by up to several orders of magnitude, depending on the methodology employed (e.g. compare [2] with [3]). Total coral reef biodiversity is a particularly obtuse problem, due to the inherently complex three-dimensional structure of these reefs [4] (figure 1a). The cracks and crevices of reefs produce space and microenvironments that can harbour multitudes of diverse organisms (figure 1b). Key to these ecosystems are the hermatypic corals themselves, largely zooxanthellate scleractinians (Cnidaria: Hexacorallia: Scleractinia), which via their symbioses with family Symbiodiniaceae zooxanthellae, produce the calcium carbonate structures that form reefs over time. Figure 1. (a) Overall landscape of a coral reef in Okinawa, southern Japan, with scleractinian corals and fishes visible, and (b) close-up three-dimensional structure of a coral reef in Okinawa, with green macroalgae, crustose coralline algae, turf algae, octocorals, zoantharians, scleractinian corals and foraminifers visible. Images: (a) = F.G., (b) = J.D.R.Download figureOpen in new tabDownload PowerPoint Comparatively speaking, we know a fair amount about the diversity of the reef-building scleractinian corals, due to their skeletal structures and the numerous features within, making taxonomy and the counting of coral species seemingly within our reach. However, these cnidarian groups have often remained taxonomically recalcitrant due to a myriad of reasons. Especially when viewed in situ or via photographs, coral identification can be a challenge, as microscale-skeletal structures often need to be examined to achieve reliable results. As they are ecosystem engineers, no ecological study of a coral reef is complete without coral abundance or diversity indices of some kind: scientists need to be able to count coral species and abundances effectively and accurately. These indices are the necessary foundation to investigate temporal changes and their causes and consequences. Ecologists can count corals via in situ observations, usually via SCUBA, which comes with a number of limitations, such as inherent risks, logistical effort, availability and accessible water depths. Other options that are becoming increasingly popular include remotely operated underwater vehicles (ROVs) or similar tools [5]. Sampling of coral colonies is another, invasive approach, but this is also time-consuming and damaging to reefs when performed at large scale, as well as limited in nature; one cannot sample every coral colony on a reef, and researchers' time underwater is limited by their air consumption. Alternately, transects or quadrats can generate two-dimensional photographic images that can later be analysed without time constraints [6], but these methods are often limited in resolution and neglect the three-dimensional nature of reefs. Three-dimensional photogrammetry methods solve this problem [7], but require large amounts of both computing power and time, and analyses are still limited to what the observer and their camera can see from above or outside of coral colonies, and cannot yet be applied at the wider scale of coral reefs. Environmental DNA (eDNA) applications therefore are ideal complements to traditional survey methods to increase detection rates and robustness of biodiversity monitoring. eDNA has the potential to non-invasively generate large amounts of marine biodiversity data [8], making it perfect for significantly improving our understanding of coral reef diversity. The first step of conducting an eDNA monitoring endeavour starts with the collection of an environmental medium that acts as source of eDNA. Sources thereby include water samples containing free DNA molecules or even whole organisms, mucus, faecal matter, gut contents or benthic sediment. The selection of source material can already influence the results, as benthic sediments and water samples can return different communities in the analyses, as well as the depth at which water samples were taken. Subsequent steps include processing and storage of the environmental samples, with the general consensus to process the samples as swiftly as possibly to prevent degradation of DNA molecules. Various protocols have been proposed for extracting DNA from environmental samples, but all generally seem to lead to satisfactory levels of DNA quantity and quality. Depending on the marker system used for amplification of the extracted DNA, single species can be focused on, or alternately even a whole community across a wide range of reef taxa with metabarcoding assays. While it may be sufficient to only detect positive PCR signals for single species confirmation, or investigate their abundance using quantitative PCR, DNA metabarcoding extends the principles of conventional molecular barcoding to mixed template samples using next-generation sequencing methods. Depending on the sequencing platform, thousands to millions of sequences are retrieved, which then need to undergo bioinformatic analyses. There are several potential ways described to process these sequences; all include quality filtering steps to exclude low quality, short, or erroneous reads. The result of the bioinformatic metabarcoding analyses usually consists of a list of sequences from all samples, which can then be compared with reference databases, resulting in a list of taxa that reflects the observed biodiversity of the eDNA sampling approach [8]. These results from eDNA studies have already helped to detect invasive, rare and cryptic species, as well as designate bioindicator species. On subtropical and tropical coral reefs, several eDNA studies have been already conducted, investigating coral diversity or even whole coral reef communities. Results so far indicate that eDNA applications can potentially be used to quantify coral cover, identify community differences within a reef system (e.g. lagoon versus reef slope), differentiate between communities along an anthropogenic stress gradient, as well as elucidate temporal patterns of coral spawning events [9–12]. The study of Nishitsuji et al. [13] demonstrates the successful large-scale use of eDNA to illuminate the scleractinian coral diversity around an entire island, Okinawa Island, southern Japan. The authors collected and examined eDNA from more than 60 locations around Okinawa Island, amplified mitochondrial marker sequences (12S ribosomal DNA) using a recently developed primer set [14] and compared their results with observations by divers at the same sites. Importantly, while both datasets were generally comparable, with similar results across sites, the eDNA dataset included more detected coral genera than the divers, and this was supported in statistical analyses. As well, the eDNA dataset included the first molecular records of at least two coral species or genera around Okinawa Island. Records and distributions form the bases of biodiversity data, and it is clear eDNA can contribute to enriching such important databases, highlighted by the detection of species not previously reported from the reefs of Okinawa. Additionally, the eDNA and diver-based datasets matched at approximately two-thirds of the sites, and at least a partial match was achieved at 91% of sites, cross-validating each method. However, which dataset should be followed when datasets do not match, as seen in two of the sites in Nishitsuji et al. [13]? This is a difficult question, and one that eDNA methodologies need to overcome. Is a diver-based assessment more reliable, perhaps due to varying primer sensitivity or mismatches [15]? Or are the eDNA data more reliable, revealing what the human diver eye cannot see? Given that most scleractinian corals should be relatively visible to the diving ecologist's eyes, it is probably very rare for eDNA methods to generate data for a coral that cannot be found with repeated focused dives. It should be noted this situation may not be applicable for other taxa that are smaller, more cryptic, or microbial. Thus, more investigation into comparisons between visual and eDNA datasets for a variety of taxa are needed to raise the reputation of eDNA methodologies for lay ecologists, as are the generation of more and different eDNA primer sets for corals or other targeted taxa. Given the exponentially increasing amount of genetic information available for marine taxa, such goals should be relatively easy to achieve and will also lay the foundation for research projects into the future. Finally, Nishitsuji et al.'s research is a welcome focus on the coral reefs of Okinawa and southern Japan [13]. It has long been recognized that the coral reefs in this region are not only comparably endemic and diverse, but also under high levels of threat due to their comparatively small area and rising anthropogenic pressures [16]. eDNA surveys and monitoring can help scientists in the region target areas for more in-depth surveys, and document biodiversity changes over time, as the extracted DNA, if stored correctly, can also serve as an archive of the biodiversity at the specific time point of the sampling. As well, amplification with marker systems targeting other marine taxa is still possible with the extracted DNA, which can help further elucidate previously unseen aspects of coral reefs. Furthermore, the successful use of eDNA for the investigation of shallow water reefs shows that this technique also has great potential for the investigation of mesophotic reef systems that are beyond the reach of SCUBA and can only be reached with increased technical effort. Can eDNA methodologies unlock biodiverse mysteries of coral reefs? Not alone. Cutting-edge technologies need a solid foundation, and eDNA is no different. The accuracy of eDNA depends on the accuracy and completeness of baseline data for target taxa, and thus cannot replace specimen-based taxonomy and biodiversity studies, which generate taxonomic frameworks and reference databases. The quality and reliability of eDNA monitoring results are thereby directly related to the quality and quantity of the available reference sequences. This can potentially lead to a large part of sequences recovered, be it amplicon sequence variants (OTUs) or operational taxonomic units (ASVs), that cannot be determined. Simply put, what is not part of a reference database cannot be found in eDNA analyses. In addition, databases may not be up to date with the latest taxonomy or may inadvertently contain incorrect information or misidentifications. These circumstances can lead to wrong taxonomic assignments in eDNA datasets. These problems can be common and often limit the integration potential of visual and eDNA data. In this context, the increasing reliance on eDNA methods in biomonitoring and marine ecology makes collection-based studies and biodiversity collections and well-curated repositories more important than ever, particularly given the rising extinction threats to our biodiversity in the Anthropocene. Scleractinian corals, unlike many marine taxa, represent an ideal group to work with in both visual surveys and with eDNA methodologies, and such studies can serve as templates for other taxa. More visual+eDNA studies similar to Nishitsuji et al. [13] across other taxa will help researchers expand and better integrate such datasets across the Tree of Life in the future. It is clear that eDNA offers massive potential to the future of coral reef ecology. While transects and imagery remain the de facto standard datasets in coral reef ecology, eDNA is being increasingly deployed, and the question as to which methodology paints a 'truer' picture of a reef is an open one. As well, what methodological approach best solves the needs of each study or conservation manager should be considered; often a rough idea of what diversity is present and how it changes in space and time may be enough for the question at hand. Both in situ diver-based and eDNA methods still have questions regarding taxonomic resolution, due to the above-mentioned issues regarding marine biodiversity (many coral reef animals remain undescribed) and taxonomy (scleractinian corals, for example, are undergoing revisions due to difficulties in often clearly delineating species boundaries). Additionally, mtDNA primers as used in Nishitsuji et al. [13] do not delineate to the species level for a range of coral taxa due to the conservative nature of mtDNA in most anthozoans [17], thus limiting potential for monitoring at such fine taxonomic resolution. Finally, as has been demonstrated in many studies [18,19], robust control sampling and measures to prevent contamination are always recommended to increase the reliability of results. Continued efforts to address all of these issues are needed alongside progress in eDNA methodologies. Regardless, eDNA represents a powerful tool for marine ecologists and coral reef science. As Nishitsuji et al. [13] have done, collecting and comparing imagery and eDNA datasets should become the standard for many studies in the near future, and we can envision a future in which eDNA data alone could be recognized as the most representative information of any given coral reef. Combined with imagery acquisition from underwater drones and ROVs [5], and streamlined AI-assisted imagery analyses [6], and the future of coral reef ecology and diversity studies will undoubtedly reveal major new discoveries. Progressive development of eDNA methodologies will lead to increasing incorporation of eDNA into the best practices for marine resource management and monitoring. The paper by Nishitsuji et al. [13] is an important step toward this exciting new future in coral reef ecology. Data accessibility This article has no additional data.

rayyan-220238550,Image-based Assessment of Vegetation Cover and Composition using U-Net-based Semantic Segmentation,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"<sc>Abstract.</sc> The vegetation cover and composition assessment is critical to understanding ecosystem health and biodiversity conservation. In the recent past, several factors such as rapid urbanization, soil degradation, and climate change have led to significant alterations in vegetation cover and composition, and have compromised Earth‘s natural ecosystem. Effective vegetation cover and composition management are quintessential to the sustainable growth of our planet. The field of vegetation cover and composition assessment is expanding as it realizes the essentiality of conserving biodiversity, effective land use planning, and optimum resource management strategies at our disposal. The recent advancements in deep learning and remote sensing technologies enable the collection of spatial information from the Earth‘s surface and the extraction of useful insights for informed decision-making that could benefit the environment. The aim of this research was to develop advanced semantic segmentation-based deep learning models using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that can effectively identify and differentiate multiple vegetation species, and accurately predict the area under vegetation cover. To achieve this target a dataset curation was done which comprised 10 diverse vegetation species especially âgrasses‘. The deep learning model of UNet was trained using different architecture backbones to generate composition assessment amongst different grass species. Also, trained predictive models were also used to evaluate the area under vegetation cover as well. The best-performing model was able to achieve an R<sup>2</sup> value of 0.84 in predicting the vegetation cover and a mean IOU score of 0.54 during testing. This study demonstrates a potential to use remote sensing data to generate vegetation cover and composition assessment for farming, urban planning, and construction applications.","",https://doi.org/10.13031/aim.202300237,"",,
rayyan-220238559,From spectra to functional plant traits: Transferable multi-trait models from heterogeneous and sparse data,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Our understanding of the Earth&amp;#180;s functional biodiversity and its imprint on ecosystem functioning, structure and resilience is still incomplete. Large-scale information on vegetation properties (&amp;#8216;plant traits&amp;#8217;) is critical to assess functional diversity and its role in the Earth system. Such parameters are constantly changing due to variations in environmental conditions which makes extensive in-situ measurements in the field not logistically feasible. The advent of the upcoming space-borne hyperspectral missions will facilitate to map these properties. However, we are still lacking efficient and accurate methods to translate hyperspectral reflectance into large scale information on plant traits across biomes, land cover and sensor types. Yet, the absence of globally representative data sets on reflectance data and the corresponding in-situ measurements represents a bottleneck to develop empirical models for estimating plant traits from hyperspectral reflectance. Recent and ongoing initiatives (e.g. EcoSIS) provide a constantly growing source of hyperspectral data and plant trait observations from different vegetation types and sensors. In this study we integrated 29 data sets including four different ecosystem types spanning from Europe to north America. By combining these heterogeneous data sets, we propose multi-trait models based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) that simultaneously infer multiple plant traits from canopy spectra. We targeted a broad set of structural and chemical traits (n=20) related to light harvesting, growth, propagation and defense (e.g. leaf mass per area, leaf area index, pigments nitrogen, phosphorus). The performance of our multi-trait CNN models predicting these traits was compared to single-trait CNNs as well as single-trait partial least squares regression (PLSR) models. The results of the multi-trait models across a broad range of vegetation types (crops, forest, tundra, grassland, shrubland) and sensor types were promising and outcompeted state-of-the-art PLSR models. We found that the overall prediction performances significantly increased from single- to multi-trait CNN models and those of PLSR models. The key contribution of this study is to highlight the potential of weakly supervised approaches together with Deep Learning to overcome the scarcity of in-situ measurements and take a step forward in creating large-scale maps of Earth&amp;#8217;s biophysical properties with the increase in availability of hyperspectral Earth observation data.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu23-10901,"",,
rayyan-220238574,Enhancing predictive mapping of soil carbon by incorporating vegetation growth dynamic information via deep learning,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"The spatial distribution of soil organic carbon (SOC) serves as critical geographic information for assessing ecosystem services and guides land management for migrating carbon emissions. Digital mapping of SOC is challenging due to the complex relationships between the soil and its environmental conditions. Except for the well-known topography and climate environmental covariates, the aboveground vegetation growth, which interacts with belowground soil carbon, in&amp;#64258;uences SOC signi&amp;#64257;cantly over seasonal and interannual variations. Although several remote-sensing-based vegetation indices (e.g. NDVI and EVI) have been widely adopted in digital soil mapping, variables indicating long-term vegetation growth status have been less used. The vegetation phenology, an indicator of vegetation growth characteristics, can be used as a potential time series environmental covariate for SOC prediction. In this study, a CNN-RNN hybrid model was developed for SOC prediction with inputs of static and dynamic environmental variables in a study area located in Xuancheng City, China. The spatially contextual features in static variables (e.g., topographic variables) were extracted by the convolutional neural network (CNN), while the temporal features in dynamic variables (e.g., vegetation phenology over a long period) were extracted by a recurrent neural network (RNN) as represented by using a long short-term memory (LSTM) network. The ten-year phenological variables before the sampling year derived from satellite-based observations were adopted as new predictors reflecting historical temporal changes in vegetation in addition to the commonly used static variables. The random forest model was used as a reference model for comparison. Our results indicate that adding phenological variables can improve the soil carbon prediction accuracy, and demonstrate that the &amp;#64257;ne-tuned CNN-RNN model is potentially effective and can be a powerful model for SOC predictive mapping. We conclude that the hybrid deep learning models have great potential to enhance soil prediction by simultaneously extracting spatial and temporal latent features from different types of environmental variables, and highlight that using the long-term historical vegetation phenology information can serve as a useful extra input for future applications in the predictive mapping of soil carbon.ReferencesZhang, L., Cai, Y., Huang, H., Li, A., Yang, L., Zhou, C., 2022.

rayyan-220238585,A hybrid deep learning framework for predicting point-level Alaskan fires,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Fires in high latitudes are becoming more critical in terrestrial ecosystem modeling. With climate warming and dry weather condition, the fires have spread more, and widespread burning has severely damaged the ecosystem. As the fire dynamics cannot be described with the mass or energy balance equations, the fire models have been developed with different input variables, linked with different vegetation models, and widely coupled with the earth system models (ESMs) or land surface models (LSMs) with different complexities of parameterization. Here, we designed a new approach using hybrid deep learning [Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) - Artificial Neural Network (ANN)] for predicting Alaskan natural fires and aimed to understand the impacts of fires with from the NCAR community land model 5 &amp;#8211; biogeochemistry (CLM5-BGC). This study was conducted based on fire information provided by Alaska Interagency Coordination Center (AICC), which provides the data for each fire point, start date, end date, and total burned area from 2016-2020. As the fire duration was identified as the most important in predicting the burned area, we first trained the LSTM for predicting fire duration (i.e., fire ignition and fire persistence period) with ERA5 atmospheric forcings. Also, we trained ANN to predict the burned area with both ERA5 atmospheric forcings and fire duration. Then, we combined two models (LSTM and ANN) to simultaneously predict the fire days and burned area with climate and vegetation datasets. This hybrid model has the strength to capture large fires (&gt;10000ha), comparing the burned area from CLM5-BGC (Correlation: 0.79). When this hybrid model is coupled with CLM5-BGC, we found that the carbon fluxes changed over Alaska. In particular, total net ecosystem exchange (NEE) increased by more than two times that of only CLM5-BGC, which could primarily affect terrestrial carbon exchanges.AcknowledgementThis work was supported by the Korea Polar Research Institute (KOPRI, PE22900) funded by the Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries and the Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea, which was funded by the Ministry of Science, ICT &amp; Future Planning (grant no. 2020R1A2C2007670) and by the Ministry of Education (2022R1A6A3A13073233).","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu23-10336,"",,

I explore how uncertainties in the region’s major anthropogenic processes, namely deforestation, forest degradation, climate change and CO2 fertilization, are shaping the existence of the world’s largest tropical forest. Amazon deforestation rates have unexpectedly rebounded in the last 10 years, whereas forest degradation, although more uncertain, seems to affect a forest area and result in carbon emissions of the same magnitude as deforestation. On the other hand, climatic extremes and/or a saturation of CO2 fertilization effect have reduced the carbon sink strength of untouched Amazon forests in 30% since the 1990’s, with related uncertainties to be addressed in the upcoming AmazonFACE (Free-Air CO2 Enrichment) experiment in central Amazon. Altogether, these processes may be pushing the Amazon anthrome closer to the so-called tipping point, with potentially serious consequences for the global climate, socioeconomics, and biodiversity. Finally, I argue how uncertainties related to CO2 effects and land tenure may be decisive for afforestation, REDD+ and BECCS projects in the region. Contributions of CO2-fertilization and deforestation to future climate and carbon storage change in the Amazon Climate change is a major threat to the Amazon rainforests. Despite the hypothesis that future atmospheric CO2 increase fertilizes rainforest and the fact that human land use (e.g., deforestation) causes a net carbon source, carbon storage changes in the Amazon due to biophysical climate effects from plant physiological response to CO2 and deforestation are often neglected in carbon accounting systems. Here, we identify the contributions of atmospheric CO2 concentration and deforestation to future Amazonian climate and carbon storage change by combining Earth system model simulations and satellite-derived estimates of aboveground biomass. Forcings from CO2-fertilization and deforestation are found to linearly decrease annual precipitation and increase surface air temperature in the Amazon. We further build a simple machine learning model, by which climate changes by CO2-fertilization and deforestation are converted into values of vegetation carbon storage. Due to a larger biomass carbon sensitivity to precipitation (about 3.4 Mg C ha-1 / 100 mm yr-1), future carbon storage in the Amazon is projected to decline due to increased water stress caused by the CO2-fertilization and deforestation. Our results highlight the importance of considering the indirect carbon impacts from climate change by CO2-fertilization and human land use for achieving a net-zero motivated future.","",https://doi.org/10.52843/cassyni.s1blph,"",,

The England Peat Map aims to provide baseline maps for the extent, depth, and condition of peaty soils in England by 2024. This will enable targeting of future restoration, support nature recovery, improve greenhouse emissions reporting and natural capital accounting.The maps will be created using a combination of multi-scale Earth observation imagery (satellite and airborne), existing and new ecological field survey data and machine/deep learning. Extent and depth mapping is implemented with random forest models and uses Sentinel satellite imagery and airborne LiDAR in combination with other ancillary datasets (e.g., geology and climate) for prediction. Assessment of peatland condition requires looking at these landscapes in different ways. Land cover mapping is used as a proxy for condition by targeting reflective classes for condition (e.g., Sphagnum, heather, and bare peat). Random forest and convolutional neural network (CNN) models are used in combination with Sentinel satellite imagery, aerial photography, and airborne LiDAR to produce national outputs. Mapping erosion/drainage features (grips, gullies and haggs) across the landscape is essential in understanding the underlying hydrological condition of the peatland and promising results have been achieved using CNNs with LiDAR and aerial photography. The final aspect of assessed condition is the movement of peat, also termed bog breathing, and is measured using Sentinel-1 Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR). This opportunity is a result of novel in-situ peat movement cameras being installed across pilot sites to provide ground truth data.The final maps will be released free of charge under an open UK government license, allowing wider application and new opportunities for use compared with currently available datasets. For example, these baseline maps have the potential to contribute towards national peatland monitoring to address further decline of peatland habitats and target restoration interventions to achieve cost effective results. Several challenges have occurred during the initial phase of the project such as the difficulty in licensing suitable training data and in defining what we are mapping when features lack a globally agreed definition (e.g., surface features). The talk will discuss these challenges as well as the future direction of the project and how these challenges can be overcome.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu23-3514,"",,

At the same time, more and more machine-learning architectures are developed, which attempt to map and detect pixel-scale changes on the Earth's surface. Such an application is forest monitoring, which is deemed nowadays highly critical, considering the threat of deforestation on a global scale. However, the spatial resolution of available open-source satellite imagery is limited. One way to address this issue is to augment the remote sensing imagery resolution using Image Super Resolution Networks. The goal of this work is to perform the Semantic Segmentation task with Sentine1-2 satellite images in order to detect forest areas. Three Deep Neural Network architectures are trained and tested. Moreover, we use a Super Resolution Deep Network to augment the resolution of the images. We create two datasets, one with original Sentine1-2 images and one with super-resolved images. We train the three architectures on the two datasets independently and we test them on a test set which combines original and super-resolved images. We show that Swin Transformer produces the best results, while training on the super-resolved images enhances the modeling power of all architectures.","",https://doi.org/10.1109/migars57353.2023.10064552,"",,

However, there is no efficient method for tracking leaf angles of plant canopies under field conditions.Here, we present AngleCam, a method to estimate leaf angle distributions from horizontal photographs acquired with timelapse cameras and deep learning. The AngleCam is a pattern recognition model based on convolutional neural networks and was trained with leaf angle distributions obtained from visual interpretation of more than 2500 plant photographs across different species and scene conditions.Leaf angle predictions were evaluated over a wide range of species, plant functional types and scene conditions using independent samples from visual interpretation (R2 = 0.84). Moreover, the method was evaluated using leaf angle estimates obtained from terrestrial laser scanning (R2 = 0.75). AngleCam was successfully tested under field-conditions for the long-term monitoring of leaf angles for two broadleaf tree species in a temperate forest. The plausibility of the predicted leaf angle time series was underlined by its close relationship with environmental variables related to transpiration. Moreover, showed that the variation in leaf angles resembles changes in several leaf-water related traits.The evaluations showed that AngleCam is a robust and efficient method to track leaf angles under field conditions. The output of AngleCam is compatible and relevant for with a range of applications, including functional-structural plant modelling, Earth system modelling or radiative transfer modelling of plant canopies.

Crop maps are also utilized for agro-environmental assessments and crop water usage monitoring. As a result, accurate and timely crop classification is essential for agricultural management and monitoring. Because it provides periodic large-scale observations of ground objects, satellite remote sensing has been regarded as an advanced tool to characterise crop types and their distributions on a regional scale. High-resolution, multispectral images of October 13, 2021, December 7, 2021 and March 6, 2022 of sentinel-2 satellite released by the European Space Agency (ESA) have been used for classification. Ground truth points have been collected manually with the android app ‘Mapmarker’ and Google Earth.

Several sustainability frameworks and programmes are now incentivizing producers to transition to regenerative farming. These evolving initiatives have created a need to build and operate Measurement, Reporting and Verification (MRV) platforms to track cropland practices and impacts. To help scale initiatives, we have developed an automated approach that leverages multi-source remote sensing, data science and machine learning for cost-effective, robust and transparent tracking of tillage practices. Our approach leverages time-series satellite observations from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 constellations, along with ancillary data from SMAP, soils and weather. Within a hierarchical classification, these inputs are blended with dense, independent training data (i.e., &amp;#8220;ground truth&amp;#8221;) collected across Europe with tens of thousands of samples gathered across France, Belgium, Denmark and the UK. Training data includes observations of crop types and rotations, residue, soil disturbance and field conditions. Together, these multi-source data feed into gradient boosting and Convolutional Neural Networks to ultimately help seasonally classify tillage practices into conventional, reduced or no till at field scale for all major row crops. Withheld independent observations and data science best practices are used to tune model performance and class accuracy depending on regional schemes, residue categories and landscape practice variability.

Manifestations of climatic aberrations are evidently diverse and extensive in nature. Unfortunately, agricultural sector is heavily vulnerable to the vagaries of climate putting global food security at stake. Farming communities rarely have access to up-to-date weather and climate information, which hinders their ability to practice climate-smart agriculture. Extreme weather events variations in rainfall and temperature can result in reduced yields or even the destruction of crops, affecting farmers’ incomes and livelihoods. Unsustainable agricultural practices compound the problem by reducing in soil fertility and the soils’ capacity to retain water, contributing to soil erosion. This can drive ecosystem degradation and habitat loss, with a resulting loss of biodiversity. To cope up with this changing scenarios, strategic innovation is a must, especially for the highly populous developing countries like Tanzania. By virtue of the generative and systemic tools of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) and its efficient knowledge management system, ICTs offers a great potential to record, transform and disseminate information while strengthening adaptability to the changing situations in multifarious ways. Remote sensing tools and corresponding technological innovations can ensure a sustainable meal to the ever-surging population. Climate change can only be confronted when these future ready technologies will be coupled with efficient agricultural extension protocols. This paper was an attempt to snowball adapted ICTs tools to climate change adaptation strategies as an innovating way to sustain food security and climate resilience community.

We compute the main vegetation index (NDVI) from the high-resolution image data provided by Planet (through the NICFI Basemaps for Tropical Forest Monitoring program). The historical NDVI values are obtained from the Sentinel 2 (and potentially LandSat) data at lower resolutions. Environmental conditions are added to the stress index by extracting the relevant meteorological parameters from the ERA5 database (temperature and precipitation) to compute the drought indices (e.g. KBDI/SPI/SPIE) and water availability (AWC) with the dominant soil type, supplemented with supporting indices from the satellite data (e.g. NDWI/SAVI/EVI-2).For reforestation projects, it is vital to monitor the impact of environmental parameters on plant health and stress, and to assist with the forest maintenance of the sites, we built time series models for temperature, precipitation, and various vegetation indices to create a baseline for site-specific growing conditions. Deep Learning (DL) models like semantic segmentation based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) can be built on top of it using transfer learning to extract the features from pre-trained models using large (global) datasets.&amp;#160;The model can not only predict tree health but can also be used to predict growing conditions in the near future by flagging out potential dry periods before they happen.The high-resolution remote sensed products are available in the (sub)tropical zone [30N - 30S], while the lower resolution products and the ERA5 data have a global cover. The test sites in this study are example sites, but the developed method can be applied to any reforestation monitoring project. The result of the analysis is a near-term growth indicator, which can be used to adjust the growing conditions of the site, as well as assist with the site selection for new reforestation projects (based on the established baseline and predictions).The next step, after validation, is to create a dashboard where the user can select any location (within the data domain) and construct the baseline and prediction, based on available information.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu23-13481,"",,

These changes, associated with climate change, are leading to biodiversity loss and the deterioration of related ecosystem services. Understanding the relationships between forest structure and function is essential for managing dryland forests to adapt to these changes. We studied the structure-function relationships in four dryland conifer forests distributed along a semiarid to sub-humid climatic aridity gradient. Forest structure was represented by leaf area index (LAI) and function by gross primary productivity (GPP), evapotranspiration (ET), and the derived efficiencies of water use (WUE= GPP/ET) and leaf area (LAE = GPP/LAI). The water and carbon fluxes at the ecosystem level were estimated by an empirical approach in which regression models were developed to relate multiple spectral data (VIs) derived from VEN&amp;#956;S and Sentinel-2A satellites, combined with meteorological data, to local eddy covariance measurements from flux tower records available at three of the four study sites.

rayyan-220238857,Towards a benchmark dataset for statistical downscaling of meteorological fields,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"The representation of the atmospheric state at high spatial resolution is of particular relevance in various domains of Earth science. While global reanalysis datasets such as ERA5 provide comprehensive repositories of meteorological data, their spatial resolution (&amp;#8710;x&amp;#8805;25 km) is too coarse to capture relevant local features, mainly over complex terrain (e.g. cold pools in valleys, low-level jets, local heavy precipitation events).Recently, various studies have started to apply deep neural networks adapted from computer vision to increase the spatial resolution of meteorological fields. Although these studies reveal great potential in the domain of statistical downscaling, intercomparison of the approaches is impeded due to a large variety of methods and deployed datasets. Comparisons to classical downscaling methods developed for decades in the meteorological community are also often underrepresented.Inspired by the available benchmark datasets for various computer vision tasks and for weather forecasting (e.g. WeatherBench and WeatherBench Probability), our study aims to provide a benchmark dataset for statistical downscaling of meteorological fields. We choose the coarse-grained ERA5 reanalysis (&amp;#8710;xERA5&amp;#8771;30 km) and the fine-scaled COSMO-REA6 (&amp;#8710;xCREA6&amp;#8771;6km) as input and target datasets. Both datasets enable the formulation of a real downscaling task: super-resolve the data and correct for model biases.The benchmark dataset provides a collection of predictors and predictands for a couple of standard downscaling tasks. These comprise downscaling of the 2m temperature, the surface irradiance, the near-surface wind field and precipitation. Along with the dataset, benchmark deep neural networks, namely variants of U-Nets and GANs, will be provided. Well-chosen sets of evaluation metrics including baseline scores of the benchmarked deep neural networks are presented to enable comparison between different methods.The envisioned benchmark dataset will provide a comprehensive basis for comparing neural network approaches on statistical downscaling of meteorological fields. This, in turn, is considered to enhance confidence and transparency in the application of deep learning methods on Earth system problems.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu23-11489,"",,
rayyan-220238864,Large-Scale Institutional Innovation in Agri-Food Systems for Food Security: Evidence from the Great Green Wall Initiative Countries,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"The presence of forests is thought to positively affect food security through direct food provision or forest-based ecosystem services, whereas clearing forests to increase cultivated area does not systematically lead to improved food security. We examined the extent to which improvements in food security can plausibly be attributed to land-use changes induced by a large-scale agricultural innovation such as the Great Green Wall initiative (GGW) in Africa. Our estimates are based on a pooled OLS with yearly fixed effects used on a combination of food insecurity (FI) probabilities from a nationally representative survey conducted by the FAO in 13 African countries with a high-resolution, near-real-time land use land cover classification (LULC) generated by deep learning on Sentinel 2 images.A country's GGW membership was found to have a negative effect on food insecurity, and an increase in tree cover while being part of the GGW initiative has a negative effect on the probability of moderate FI and a statistically significant negative effect on the probability of severe FI. Also, sustainable land management practices proxied by an increase in crop cover while being part of the GGW initiative have a negative effect on the probability of moderate FI and a statistically significant negative effect on severe FI. The effect of an increase in tree cover can be explained by the resulting potential for dietary diversity and the GGW-induced sustainable land management practices leading to larger crop areas and better yields. Sustaining the gains of such large-scale innovation over a long period may improve communities' overall social sustainability.","",https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4476155,"",,

rayyan-220238914,Artificial Intelligence and Advanced Analytics for Food Security,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Climate change, increasing population, food-versus-fuel economics, pandemics, etc. pose a threat to food security to unprecedented levels. It has fallen upon the practitioners of agriculture and technologists of the world to innovate and become more productive to address the multi-pronged food security challenges. Agricultural innovation is key to managing food security concerns. The infusion of data science, artificial intelligence (AI), advanced analytics, satellites data, geospatial data, climatology, sensor technologies, and climate modeling with traditional agricultural practices such as soil engineering, fertilizers use, and agronomy are some of the best ways to achieve this. Data science helps farmers to unravel patterns in fertilizer pricing, equipment usage, transportation and storage costs, yield per hectare, and weather trends to better plan and spend resources. AI enables farmers to learn from fellow farmers to apply best techniques that are transferred learning from AI to improve agricultural productivity and to achieve financial sustainability. Sensor technologies play an important role in getting real-time farm field data and provide feedback loops to improve overall agricultural practices and can yield huge productivity gains. Advanced Analytics modeling is essential software technique that codifies farmers' tacit knowledge such as better seed per soil, better feed for dairy cattle breed, or production practices to match weather pattern that was acquired over years of their hard work to share with worldwide farmers to improve overall production efficiencies, the best antidote to food security issue. In addition to the paradigm shift, economic sustainability of small farms is a major enabler of food security. The book reviews all these technological advances and proposes macroeconomic pricing models that data mines macroeconomic signals and the influence of global economic trends on small farm sustainability to provide actionable insights to farmers to avert any financial disasters due to recurrent economic crises.","",https://doi.org/10.1201/9781003323099,"",,
rayyan-220238927,Are Southeast Asian lakes impacted by changes in climate and land-use? A historical and future scenario analysis.,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Southeast Asian lakes provide several ecosystem services and are an important natural resource for water supplies, industry, agriculture, shipping, fishing, and recreation. It has been demonstrated that they are highly vulnerable to anthropogenic and climate threats. Recent scientific findings clearly demonstrated that climate change has already significantly affected the SEA region and that these impacts will continue and expand as the pace of climate change accelerates. However, a deep understanding of ""if"" and ""how"" climate change as well as intensification of land uses may exacerbate those impacts on such vulnerable ecosystems across the whole region is lacking.To contribute towards filling some of the existing knowledge gaps, in a renowned data scarce region, we present the results of a 3-year-long interdisciplinary research project entitled Climate Change Risk Assessment for Southeast Asian Lakes (CCRASEAL), led by the Asian Institute of Technology and funded by the Asia Pacific Network for Global Research (APN).We present new insights on: i) historical, remote sensing derived, yearly land use changes from 1992 to 2021 estimated at basin scale across whole mainland SEA; ii) historical and future changes in climate respectively for the periods 1970-2006 and 2007-2100 using different downscaled CORDEX-SEA climate data at lake level; iii) detected and assessed climate and land use long-term trends and their coupled impacts on both monthly runoff at multi-basin scale level and lake surface areas of more than 700 water bodies. Finally, we detected and assessed the satellite-derived Lake Surface Water Temperature (LSWT) trends, an essential climate variable (ECV), within defined historical and future scenarios and across whole mainland SEA.To achieve our results, we used and integrated multi-source and multi-resolution datasets made of satellite derived water and land products along with available climatic CORDEX-SEA climate datasets. Furthermore, we used a combination of conventional remote sensing, GIS, machine- and deep learning based processing approaches. In our studies we analysis possible spatial and temporal linkages between observed alterations to multiple-threats, to understand &amp;#8220;if&amp;#8221;, &amp;#8220;when&amp;#8221;, &amp;#8220;how&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;where&amp;#8221; climate and land use changes had affected and will affect SEA lakes.Results have been validated using, when available, ground-based observation collected at national and regional scales.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu23-17455,"",,
rayyan-220238931,Modeling landscape-scale vegetation response to climate: Synthesis of the EarthNet challenge,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"The biosphere displays high heterogeneity at landscape-scale. Vegetation modelers struggle to represent this variability in process-based models because global observations of micrometeorology and plant traits are not available at such fine granularity. However, remote sensing data is available: the Sentinel 2 satellites with a 10m resolution capture aspects of localized vegetation dynamics. The EarthNet challenge (EarthNet2021, [1]) aims at predicting satellite imagery conditioned on coarse-scale weather data. Multiple research groups approached this challenge with deep learning [2,3,4]. Here, we evaluate how well these satellite image models simulate the vegetation response to climate, where the vegetation status is approximated by the NDVI vegetation index.Achieving the new vegetation-centric evaluation requires three steps. First, we update the original EarthNet2021 dataset to be suitable for vegetation modeling: EarthNet2021x includes improved georeferencing, a land cover map, and a more effective cloud mask. Second, we introduce the interpretable evaluation metric VegetationScore: the Nash Sutcliffe model efficiency (NSE) of NDVI predictions over clear-sky observations per vegetated pixel aggregated through normalization to dataset level. The ground truth NDVI time series achieves a VegetationScore of 1, the target period mean NDVI a VegetationScore of 0. Third, we assess the skill of two deep neural networks with the VegetationScore: ConvLSTM [2,3], which combines convolutions and recurrency, and EarthFormer [4], a Transformer adaptation for Earth science problems.&amp;#160;Both models significantly outperform the persistence baseline. They do not display systematic biases and generally catch spatial patterns. Yet, both neural networks achieve a negative VegetationScore. Only in about 20% of vegetated pixels, the deep learning models do beat a hypothetical model predicting the true target period mean NDVI. This is partly because models largely underestimate the temporal variability. However, the target variability may partially be inflated by the noisy nature of the observed NDVI. Additionally, increasing uncertainty for longer lead times decreases scores: the mean RMSE in the first 25 days is 50% lower than between 75 and 100 days lead time. In general, consistent with the EarthNet2021 leaderboard, the EarthFormer outperforms the ConvLSTM. With EarthNet2021x, a more narrow perspective to the EarthNet challenge is introduced. Modeling localized vegetation response is a task that requires careful adjustments of off-the-shelf computer vision architectures for them to excel. The resulting specialized approaches can then be used to advance our understanding of the complex interactions between vegetation and climate.&amp;#160;[1] Requena-Mesa, Benson, Reichstein, Runge and Denzler.

rayyan-220238990,An Analysis of Machine Learning Techniques for Forest Cover Type Classification,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"For environmental management and conservation, forecasting the forest's tree cover is essential. Accurate prediction models are needed to evaluate the possible effects and pinpoint places that need rapid attention as deforestation and forest degradation become a more widespread concern. In this study, we employ machine learning to predict forest tree cover using dataset of environmental variables and historical tree cover data. The foundation of our approach is the Random Forests ensemble learning technique, which combines different decision trees to improve prediction accuracy. Our goal is to create a model that, using environmental variables like elevation, rainfall, temperature, and soil type, can precisely forecast the number of trees in each location. To train and evaluate our model, we employ a dataset of more than 500,000 forested regions located throughout the United States. With predictions of forest tree cover being upto 97% accurate, the results demonstrate that the Random Forest model outperforms conventional machine learning techniques. Machine learning may be utilised as a useful tool in environmental management and conservation efforts by estimating the amount of forest tree cover. Accurate tree cover forecast can help in determining which regions need forest preservation, reforestation, or both.","",https://doi.org/10.1109/ic3i59117.2023.10397823,"",,
rayyan-220239000,"Crop Yield Forecasting by Integrating Data Assimilation, Crop Model, and Machine Learning",,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Timely and reliable regional crop yield forecasting before harvest is critical for managing climate risk, adjusting agronomic management, and making food trade policy. Although various methods exist for crop yield forecasting, including process-based crop models and machine learning techniques, the potential of integrating these methods for early-season yield forecasts has not been well investigated. In this study, we proposed a hybrid framework for crop yield forecasting that firstly assimilated remote sensing leaf area index and soil moisture into a crop model and then combined the data-assimilated crop model with machine learning techniques to improve the prediction skill further. The proposed framework was demonstrated in winter wheat yield forecasting in the North China Plain during 2009–2015. Results showed that assimilating multi-source data into crop model improved wheat yield predictions significantly, with the anomaly correlation coefficient (ACC) increasing by 0.27 and the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) decreasing by 6.12% compared to unassimilated results. Incorporating weather forecasts enabled reliable winter wheat yield forecasts up to 1–3 months in advance (median ACC > 0.79, MAPE < 6.48%). Furthermore, integrating the assimilated crop model with machine learning techniques improved the forecasting further, increasing ACC by 0.19 and reducing MAPE by 5.63% compared to the standalone crop model (median ACC = 0.95, MAPE < 3.14%). The proposed framework for crop yield forecasting can be adapted to other crops and regions and has a great potential in developing food security early warning system at a regional scale.","",https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4467836,"",,

(Credit: Pairwise)Food scientist and entrepreneur Haven Baker's children are sick of kale. ""My kids don't want us to buy more salad kits with kale—they don't want to eat it!"" Baker told GEN Biotechnology. ""They want to eat romaine lettuce.""Baker's kids are not alone. In households across the United States, kids and adults alike want nothing to do with the leafy superfood. ""While things like kale have a lot of nutrition, most people don't want to eat [bitter] greens,"" said Baker, the cofounder and chief business officer at the food tech company Pairwise. ""People want to eat lettuce, especially iceberg and romaine, which pack almost no nutrition.""A little more than half of the population in the United States eats their recommended daily allowance of vegetables, whereas 1 in 10 people simply do not have access to such luxuries. Despite all the best efforts in public education and other focus areas, these trends have not improved much for decades. Baker and the team at Pairwise aim to build a healthier world by using CRISPR genome editing to develop novel nourishing foods that lower barriers to fruit and vegetable consumption, such as taste and accessibility. ""We're working on improving convenience and nutrition, increasing snacking ability, and making consumption easier,"" Baker said.Haven Baker, Cofounder and Chief Business Officer at PairwisePairwise believes the use of technology offers a transformative opportunity to open a new horizon for the $66 billion U.S. retail produce market and is currently developing new fruits and vegetables. In 2023, Pairwise hopes to follow in the footsteps of Sanatech's genetically edited Sicilian Rouge tomatoes being released into the Japanese market in September 2021 (Box 1). Rooted in North Carolina, Pairwise will sell several produce varieties ""improved"" by gene editing under the brand name Conscious Foods. The first product is Conscious Greens, which will be salad blends (Fig. 1). Heading to the market after that are seedless blackberries and pitless cherries.FIG. 1. Conscious Greens brings new offerings of greens with superior nutrition to current salad options. (Credit: Pairwise)Pairwise announced $25 million in Series A funding in March 2018, led by Deerfield and what is now Leaps by Bayer, and $90 million in Series B in February 2021 to develop its gene editing platform and initial product portfolio. In 2018, the company also announced a $100 million collaboration with what is now Bayer Crop Science to advance gene editing tools in corn, soybeans, wheat, canola, and cotton.Pairwise was launched in 2017 by a familiar trio of CRISPR gene editing experts: Broad Institute colleagues Feng Zhang, David Liu, and Keith Joung, an investigator at Mass General Hospital. The three friends were also cofounders of Editas Medicine, the first CRISPR biotech company to go public. Although these principal investigators are not exactly known for their prowess with plants, the utility of CRISPR and the untapped potential of genome editing in agbiotech made it almost inevitable that they would apply their expertise to farming rather than pharma.To zero in on potential commercial products, Pairwise looks at the intersection of three perspectives: consumer benefit, scientific feasibility, and return on investment (ROI). The initial step is to find patterns in consumer data for what people want to eat and why. They have found that not all fruits and vegetables fit people's modern lifestyles. For example, the introduction of baby carrots in the 1980s led to an increase in carrot consumption because they were easier to snack on and add to salads.Box 1. From Garden to Sea: Japanese Approved CRISPR-Edited ProductsSanatech Seed Co, Ltd., a start-up company partnering with the University of Tsukuba, has been selling gene-edited tomatoes directly to consumers in Japan since September 2021. These tomatoes have been genetically altered with CRISPR to contain high levels of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA). The Tokyo-based manufacturer received a parental line of the Sicilian Rouge variety from Pioneer EcoScience and developed the variety ""Sicilian Rouge High GABA"" with enhanced GABA content through gene editing. Taking GABA orally, according to Sanatech, can lower blood pressure and promote relaxation.In addition, CRISPR-edited food has made the jump from the produce aisle to the seafood counter in Japan. In October, the country approved two CRISPR-edited fish: a red sea bream with more muscle growth and a gene-edited tiger puffer with less hunger. The fish were developed through a collaboration of the Kyoto-based Regional Fish Institute, Kyoto University, and Kinki University, and was overseen by the Japan Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare and the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries.Both fish grow bigger than their wild counterparts. The genome-edited tiger pufferfish grows faster and gains 90% more weight in the same amount of time as the traditional puffer. This allows a shortening of the farming period from the conventional 2 years. Sliced pufferfish sets are sold through the website in various sizes and prices.The genome-edited red sea bream has 20–60% more edible yield, whereas feed utilization efficiency was increased by ∼14%. It was introduced to the press under the nickname ""Muscle Madai"" (madai means red sea bream in Japanese) but is being sold by Regional Fish Online as ""22nd Century Sea Bream."" A set of ∼16 thin slices on a bed of dried kelp is sold in Japan for ¥3,000 (or about $22).The Regional Fish Institute does not plan to stop there and announced—along with Kyoto University and Tokyo Marine University—being awarded a government subsidy of ¥97.5 million (over $710,000) for research as a ""year-2022 growth-type small and medium enterprise R&D support project."" The company will use the money to develop gene-edited tilapia and vannamei shrimp.Box 2. The Tail-End of Transcription Activator-Like Effector Nuclease Food Products?Preceding DNA editing methods, like transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs), have been and may still be used to make food ingredients available to consumers. Both CRISPR and TALEN are highly specific, producing few off-target editing (cleavage) effects (thus preventing undesired cell mutations), and can be fused to other functional protein modules for versatility in gene manipulation. Both have also been reported to be superior in specific applications, but CRISPR's popularity has grown among researchers because the smaller size of the tailored part makes them simpler to design and cheaper to use.There have been a wide range of TALEN users from large commercial seed companies (e.g., Bayer, Syngenta) to small biotech companies (e.g., Simplot, Epicrop) to enhance the efficiency and precision of the crop improvement process. A few TALEN-edited crops have made it to market, such as a TALEN-edited soybean oil without trans fats—high oleic low linolenic (HOLL)—was released to the market by Calyxt, a plant-based technology company, in 2019. In June 2020, Calyxt announced that its HOLL soybean was deemed a nonregulated article by the Biotechnology Regulatory Services of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), an agency of the United States Department of Agriculture.Similarly, in April 2021, APHIS is extending deregulation to J.R. Simplot Company's (Simplot) potato variety developed using genetic engineering, designated as Snowden Z6 (Z6 potato). The potato variety is engineered for late blight protection, lowered reducing sugars, low acrylamide potential, and reduced black spot bruising. After considering the public comments, APHIS has determined Z6 potato is unlikely to post a plant pest risk and is extending deregulation to the Z6 potato line.Just as with CRISPR, TALEN has been applied not only to produce but also to animal products. A 2019 study in Japan, ""Targeted mutagenesis of the ryanodine receptor by Platinum TALENs causes slow swimming behavior in Pacific bluefin tuna (Thunnus orientalis),"" the Platinum TALENs method of gene-editing was used rather than CRISPR to induce mutations in Pacific bluefin tuna. The change reduced the ""burst swimming"" ability of the tuna.As a result, when the bluefin were disturbed by touching them, they swam away slowly, rather than with a burst of speed. Farm-raised tuna with burst swimming edited out may be less likely to break their necks by swimming at high speed into the walls of tanks and net pens, a common cause of mortality. The trait has not yet been commercialized, but Japan's farmed bluefin sector gained stronger footing in 2021, giving those pursuing the technology a strong incentive to push their progress.Baker says that the data show that consumers want freshness and consistency, yet the quality of many fruits and vegetables changes from week to week or season to season. ""If you look at blueberry consumption, it has gone up three to four times in the past 25 years, largely due to being made available year-round,"" Baker said. ""Are there any summer fruits that we would eat more of if they were available in good quality year-round? The response is, absolutely!""Crisper with CRISPRThere is a lot of traditional breeding that has been employed in increasing production or making life easier for farmers, but more effort needs to be focused on making better food products for consumers faster.""If you're a cherry farmer, you're worried about disease and yield, but if you're a consumer of cherries, you'd really like to get rid of the pit and have them available year-round,"" said Baker. ""Sometimes, these products could be created through conventional breeding, but most of the time, if it could have been done within 50 or 100 years, it would've already been done.""With the transformative potential of CRISPR, Pairwise is creating new crops based on consumer research. ""We take these potentially viable products and use CRISPR to accelerate and bring those traits forward. With CRISPR, we can approach some of these fundamental problems that have hampered consumption and availability.""Pairwise has also put a lot of money into developing technology that can quickly come up with a product idea for consumers. The company has raised $115 million in two funding rounds to help it improve gene editing technology for row crops and other plant-based uses. ""We are innovating the editing technology to make new products or more products than we could two years ago,"" said Aaron Hummel, vice president of research and development at Pairwise.Genetically Modified Organism IntoleranceThe Pairwise team is alert to the fact that previous attempts at plant genetic engineering have not been successful (Box 2). Consumer acceptance of their products' use of CRISPR technology appears to be aided by the fact that these crops are not classified as ""genetically modified organisms"" (GMOs). Rather, they are referred to as ""genome-edited."" To this end, there is no mention of GMOs, which typically refer to the practice of transferring genes between organisms and worry many consumers, on the Pairwise and Conscious Food websites.This change in terminology may have significantly lessened the historical backlash against bioengineered plants. Recent studies show that attitudes toward gene editing in agriculture are changing (at least in the United States), but most of the people who took part in the studies said they knew very little or nothing about the practice. People have heard of and are enthusiastic about CRISPR. When asked without more information, about half of the people who took part in the study agreed that gene editing is good for agriculture. However, after reading a short introduction, nearly two-thirds of them felt the same way.According to Sarah Davidson Evanega, lead of stakeholder communication at Pairwise, the biggest confusion really revolves around language. She claimed that, despite their similarities in sound, genetic engineering and gene editing are very different in terms of how they are carried out. It serves as a reminder of how crucial using the appropriate language is.Aaron Hummel, Vice President of Research and Development at PairwiseMany of Pairwise's products made with CRISPR require investigation to untangle the genes and pathways behind plant traits. Hummel said that plant tissues and biochemical pathways are very different in their complexity. Some of Pairwise's plant variants are very simple, controlled by a single gene, and require just one edit to make them. But in other cases, the trait in question is multigenic, which means that several genes have effects that add up or work together. In these cases, it takes more than one edit to get the right phenotype.Sometimes, plant biology is not fully understood and requires more discovery work. Hummel says that there have been cases wherein Pairwise has created a series of edits at a specific target gene, followed by phenotyping to see which variants best expressed the sought-after trait. Or sometimes, they might be in the dark about which gene to target. In these situations, Pairwise researchers usually assemble a set of gene targets to alter and test how they affect the target tissue. Either way, when doing this kind of discovery work, Hummel says they typically measure the trait in question and a couple of effects where the plant might compensate negatively.The Not-So-Mean Mr. MustardPairwise's Conscious Greens are an example of how they do research and development to make new and better fruits and vegetables. With this product, the innovation is making mustard greens that are healthy, do not taste spicy, and do not have a strong smell. Pairwise found that consumers want more nutritious options for greens because they do not like the taste of bitter greens. Pairwise was looking for ways to make salads healthier than just lettuce, so they focused on mustard greens, which have very healthy leaves but are too pungent for most salad lovers. The potential ROI also looked promising: packaged salads are a $10 billion industry and one of the largest parts of the supermarket produce aisle.Chewing mustard greens produces compounds known as allyl-isothiocyanates, which are pungent and antiherbivory (i.e., defense mechanisms against herbivore attack). As cells rupture from chewing, two physically separated molecules—a myrosinase enzyme and a glucosinolate precursor—mix and create allyl-isothiocyanate, also found in other pungent plants such as horseradish. But when cooked, the myrosinase enzyme gets broken down (denatured), preventing the reaction in the mustard greens' leaves.Hummel says that the team at Pairwise used gene editing to knock out the myrosinase gene, mimicking the effect of cooking and preventing the reaction that creates bitterness from occurring. Removing the gene to eliminate pungency required a fairly simple edit: a frameshift in the coding sequence, resulting in a loss of protein function.But it was not all straightforward. ""The complex part of developing this product is because the mustard species is tetraploid, which led to many more targets in the genome that we had to knock out all simultaneously to get the full non-pungent effect,"" Hummel said. ""The edit was straightforward, but getting the right phenotype was pretty complex. The result is that the leaves are now nonpungent, and there's a fairly pleasant flavor—it tastes relatively similar to lettuce, and the texture of the leaf is a lot like lettuce. So, we're very excited about this as a better salad product.""Miniaturized Mangoes and MoreBaker says Conscious Greens will be available in select grocery stores and restaurants in the United States in 2023. ""We plan on launching Conscious Greens in regional retail markets next summer. We are now finishing product development and doing tests where we grow these in fields and run them through processing plants.""Pairwise has sent out thousands of free samples to get feedback from customers, in part to find out if they have got the right crunch and color. Conscious Greens will have more than one edited variety of mustard greens, all of which should help make a very healthy salad mix. Patrick Hsu, cofounder of the Arc Institute and assistant professor of bioengineering and Deb Faculty Fellow in the College of Engineering at the University of California, Berkeley, tweeted last summer that he was excited to try the world's first CRISPR-edited salad from Conscious Foods.In a decade or so, Baker envisions Pairwise selling bite-sized, healthy, and flavorful fruits and vegetables—mangos the size of cherries with edible skins available all year—to replace chips and Snickers as the snacks of the future. And he hopes that products like this will be joined in the produce section by many other foods and vegetables made by other CRISPR produce companies.""This is going to change, hopefully in a positive way, all fruits and vegetables and eventually agriculture in a positive dimension. It will enable adaptations to climate change, disease resistance, and better profits for growers. There's a growing recognition that we will need [gene editing] technology to solve these problems, especially in an era of food inflation.

rayyan-220239042,Mapping fish species distributions in River Rhone using environmental DNA and remote sensing,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Biodiversity loss in freshwater river ecosystems is much faster and more severe than in terrestrial systems, and spatial conservation and restoration plans are needed to halt this erosion. Reliable and highly resolved data on the state of and change in biodiversity are critical for effective measures. However, high-resolution biodiversity maps still need to be improved, especially for large riverine systems. Coupling data from the latest global satellite sensors with broad-scale environmental DNA (eDNA) and machine learning could enable fast and precise mapping of the distribution of river organisms. Here, we investigated the potential for combining these methods using a unique fish eDNA data set sampled along the entire length of the Rhone river in Switzerland and France. Using Sentinel 2 and Landsat 8 images, we generated a set of ecological variables describing both the aquatic part (blue) and the surrounding terrestrial landscape of the river (green). We combined these variables with eDNA-based presence and absence data on 29 fish species and used three models to assess environmental suitability for these species. Most models showed good performance, indicating that ecological variables derived from remote sensing can provide valuable information on the ecological determinants of fish species distributions. Variable importance analyses showed that the blue variables (water temperature, water quality, water clarity) had stronger associations than the green variables surrounding the river. The species range mapping indicated a significant transition in the species occupancy along the Rhone, from its source in the Swiss Alps to its outlet into the Mediterranean Sea in southern France. Our study demonstrates the feasibility of combining remote sensing and eDNA to map species distributions in large rivers; this method can be up-scaled to any large river worldwide. Hence, in the future, the approach presented here could be used to predict precise biodiversity distributions in rivers to help design conservation schemes.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu23-1918,"",,

Recent applications of machine learning and data mining methods have demonstrated their effectiveness in large-scale assessments of landslide susceptibility. At Climate X, we utilise a range of big Earth remote sensing data alongside machine learning techniques to evaluate the spatial susceptibility landslides at continental scale. We compile several conditioning factors&amp;#8212; including topographic, subsurface, and land use data&amp;#8212;and combine them with continental scale landslide inventories to generate landslide susceptibility maps for Europe and North America. Climate model projections for different emissions scenarios are then used to understand how climate change could modify the spatial occurrence of landslide events with a focus on landslides triggered by rainfall within steeper terrain. Our results demonstrate how the combined application of big Earth data and machine learning can provide time sensitive assessments of landslide hazard over large spatial scales.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu23-16218,"",,

BridgET (Bridging the gap between the land and the sea in a virtual Environment for innovative Teaching and community involvement in the science of climate change-induced marine and coastal geohazard) is an EU ERASMUS+ project designed to develop innovative and inclusive teaching methods to address a growing demand for strategic skills and scientific expertise in the field of 3D geological mapping of coastal environments. Seamless integration of the wide variety of multisource and multiscale onshore, nearshore and offshore geospatial data is indeed one of the main areas for improvement in the implementation of efficient management practices in coastal regions, where climate change, rising sea level, and geohazards are considerable environmental issues.BridgET involves a partnership consisting of six European universities with outstanding expertise in the study of geological hazards, and climate impacts in marine and coastal areas (i.e., University of Milano-Bicocca, Italy, Arctic University of Troms&amp;#248;/CAGE - Norway, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens - Greece, Kiel University, Germany, University of Liege &amp;#8211; Belgium, and the University of Malta), two Italian research institutes (INGV and INAF) and a German company (Orthodrone GmvH) specialized in UAS-based LiDAR and photogrammetry data acquisition services and analyses. Project implementation relies on delivering learning and teaching activities through dedicated summer schools for MSc students by efficiently combining the partner&amp;#8217;s expertise. Schools focus on giving students a hands-on experience with the variety of methods and procedures adopted in geospatial data acquisition and processing, including the use of drones (Uncrewed Aerial System &amp;#8211; UAS), acoustic remote sensing techniques and underwater robotic systems, together with &amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;the progress made by computer visions and digital image analysis by using Artificial Intelligence (AI). Students are also introduced to the opportunity to easily examine multiple viewing angles of the seabed and coastal 3D surfaces by using immersive and non-immersive Virtual Reality (VR), to bring them closer to a more straightforward observation of geomorphological data and geological phenomena.The first Summer School was held in Santorini between the 3rd and 14th of October, 2022. It was attended by 26 students coming from 13 different countries. Teaching and learning activities included several classrooms, fieldwork, laboratory sessions, and seven seminars and cultural visits dealing with transversal topics, allowing students to approach an integrated understanding of human interaction with physical processes from social and economic perspectives. In this presentation, we give examples of course content used to allow students to develop a deeper understanding of theoretical and practical knowledge of climate-induced coastal and marine geohazards. Participants' opinions on the quality of the offered learning/training activities of the Erasmus+ BridgET Santorini Summer School (collected through a dedicated questionnaire) will also be presented.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu23-13999,"",,
rayyan-220239195,Spatially Seagrass Mapping Across the Entire Coast of Tanzania,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Seagrasses are marine flowering plants found in both temperate and tropical coastal environments, that offer vital ecosystem services and adaptations. However, due to their proximity to the shore, they are heavily impacted by human activities and climate change, endangering seagrasses and their services. To manage seagrass meadows effectively and sustainably, detailed monitoring is essential. Unfortunately, past under-prioritization of reliable baseline data impedes understanding of ecosystem dynamics and rapid response to declines. This study employs satellite imagery, coupled with ground truthing, to comprehensively report seagrass coverage along Tanzania's mainland coast and Zanzibar islands. By utilizing machine-learning technologies, the study achieves 84.2% accuracy, and found that Tanzania has 2 817 km2 of seagrass coverage, which is five times higher than previously reported. In addition, the results also provide coverage of additional benthic habitats, such as corals, rocks/rubbles, and sand. This study provides the first comprehensive overview of seagrass coverage in Tanzania and will function as a valuable tool and baseline for understanding and managing these habitats. The findings suggest that seagrasses in Tanzania are still relatively abundant, but due to a number of threats, including pollution, coastal development, and climate change, these habitats require improvement in management strategies including regular monitoring to understand their status and trends in their area coverage. The study also exemplify and underscore the significance of remote sensing and machine learning in mapping and monitoring coastal habitats across extensive geographical areas. We aspire for the presented results to be utilized among other stakeholders of coastal management, including other researchers to develop more effective conservation measures for seagrasses in Tanzania and Western Indian Ocean.","",https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4643833,"",,
rayyan-220239198,"Improving LULUCF carbon emissions/removals estimates for Flanders, Belgium, through high-resolution prediction of land use based on a machine learning approach",,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"The quality of national and regional estimates of carbon emissions/removals under the LULUCF sector directly depends on the quality of the used input data for land use and land use changes, and their associated carbon stocks and emission/removal factors. The increasingly strict European regulations for greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reporting and the growing importance of the LULUCF sector in climate action plans and policies provide clear incentives to strive for continuous improvement of LULUCF datasets, including their spatial and temporal resolution.The region of Flanders, Belgium, is characterized by relatively heterogeneous land use, which is monitored at a high spatial resolution resulting in the triennial production of a detailed land use map (18 categories, raster map with cell size of 10 by 10 meters). However, the estimation of LULUCF carbon emissions/removals currently relies on a different, less detailed land use dataset (5 categories, regular grid of 6799 points each representing an area of approximately 2000 by 1000 meters). The use of the latter dataset is motivated by the adoption of a similar approach over the three regions of Belgium, to guarantee the consistent integration of regional carbon emissions/removals estimates into the national GHG inventory. Apart from the general limitations of a sample-based dataset, this LULUCF land use dataset provides insufficient detail to grasp the effect of LULUCF-related policies and measures, undermining the use of derived carbon emissions/removals estimates for policy evaluation and development at the level of Flanders.To overcome the issues related with spatial (and temporal) resolution of the current LULUCF land use dataset, we tested a machine learning approach to integrate four more detailed data sources available for Flanders in order to predict the corresponding LULUCF land use at a resolution of 10 meters. More specifically, we used the land use file, the land use map, the land cover map, and the dataset of registered agricultural parcels as input data in a multinomial logistic regression, considering a search neighbourhood with a 10-m radius around an original LULUCF land use data point. The model was created based on input data for two years, namely 2012 and 2015. Of the original LULUCF dataset, 70% of the data points was used for training of the model, leaving 30% for validation. In a first test, a prediction accuracy of approximately 90% was achieved. After manual correction of the original LULUCF dataset, the accuracy improved to 94%.Although the approach proved successful for the prediction of the LULUCF land use for the individual years considered, less satisfying results were found when using the predictions to derive the land use change between these years: a land use change was estimated to occur at 8% of the total area of Flanders, while this was only 2% and 4% based on the original dataset before and after manual correction. Considering the major significance of the land use change area in the estimation of carbon emissions/removals, further research is required to adjust the methodology in order to guarantee the prediction of a consistent land use time series.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu23-9861,"",,
rayyan-220239208,Estimating non-linear persistence for impact assessment in European forests,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Persistence is an important characteristic of many complex systems in nature and of the Earth system in particular. Relating this statistical concept to physical properties of ecosystems is rather elusive, but reflects how long the system remains at a certain state before changing to a different one and is measured via the memory and dependence of values on past states [1]. Characterizing persistence in the terrestrial biosphere is very relevant to understand intrinsic properties of the system such as legacy effects of extreme climate events [2]. Such memory effects are often highly non-linear and therefore challenging to detect in observational records and poorly represented in Earth system models. This study estimates long and short-term non-linear persistence in eddy-covariance flux measurements and remote sensing products in European forests and the corresponding hydro-meteorological data. Characterizing persistence in the data allows us to make inferences on the interaction between Drought-Heat events, forest dynamics, and ecosystem resilience [3]. The comparison of in-situ and Earth Observation (EO) data allows us to infer how meaningful EO data are for monitoring complex dynamics in ecosystems.For short-term, spatio-temporal persistence, we use echo state networks using the technique suggested in [4] as an explainable AI (XAI) technique. In this context, the persistence of the system can be estimated by the model's response when the input fades abruptly. For the characterization of long-term persistence, we introduce a novel kernel extension of the well-established Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA) [5], a method widely used in atmospheric sciences [1]. The DFA method is a scaling analysis that provides a simple quantitative parameter (the scaling exponent) to represent the correlation properties of a signal and a characteristic time of the event of interest. Unlike DFA, the proposed kernel DFA method can handle non-linear time-scales interactions.&amp;#160;Estimating the non-linear persistence of forests and climate data allows us to relate characteristic times, crossover points between different scaling exponents, and short-term memory parameters with the duration and intensity of the events, as well as an indicator of change in the vegetation response to hydro-climatic conditions.&amp;#160;[1] Salcedo-Sanz, S., et al. &amp;#8220;Persistence in complex systems&amp;#8221;.

rayyan-220239211,Self-Supervised Contrastive Model for Flood Mapping and Monitoring on SAR Time-Series,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Flooding is a natural disaster that has been increasing in recent years due to climate and land-use changes. Earth observations, such as Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data, are valuable for assessing and mitigating the negative impacts of flooding. Cloud cover is highly correlated with flooding events, making SAR a preferable choice over optical data for flood mapping and monitoring.Traditional methods for flood mapping and monitoring using SAR data, such as otsu and CVA, can be affected by noise, false detections due to shadows and occlusions, and geometric distortions. While automatic thresholding can be effective with these methods, manual adjustment of the threshold is often required to produce an accurate change map.&amp;#160;Supervised deep learning methods using large amounts of labeled data could potentially improve the accuracy of flood mapping and monitoring. We have a large amount of earth observation data, but the availability of labeled data is limited and labeling data is time-consuming and requires domain expertise. On the other hand, Supervised model training on small datasets causes severe generalizability issues when inference is taken on a new site.&amp;#160;To address these challenges, we propose a novel self-supervised method for mapping and monitoring floods on Sentinel-1 SAR time-series data. We propose a probabilistic model trained on unlabeled data using self-supervised techniques, such as reconstruction and contrastive learning. The model is trained to learn the spatiotemporal features of the area. It monitors the changes by comparing the latent feature distribution at each time stamp and generates change maps to reflect the changes in the area.&amp;#160;We also propose a framework for flood monitoring that continuously monitor the area using time series data. This framework automatically detects the change point i.e. when the major change started reflecting on available SAR data. Our continuous monitoring framework combined with a better temporal resolution (better than Sentinel-1) can potentially detect flood events in an early stage, allowing for more time for evacuation planning.&amp;#160;The model is evaluated on nine recent flood events from &amp;#8216;Mekong&amp;#8217;, &amp;#8216;Somalia&amp;#8217;, &amp;#8216;Scotland&amp;#8217;, &amp;#8216;Australia&amp;#8217;, &amp;#8216;Bosnia&amp;#8217;, &amp;#8216;Germany&amp;#8217;, &amp;#8216;Spain&amp;#8217;, &amp;#8216;Bolivia&amp;#8217;, and &amp;#8216;Slovakia&amp;#8217; sites. We compared our results with traditional methods, and existing supervised and unsupervised methods. Our detailed evaluation indicates that our model is more accurate and generalizable to new sites. The model achieves an average Intersection Over Union (IoU) value of 70% and an F1 score of 81.14%, which are both higher than the scores of the previous best-performing method. Overall, our proposed model&amp;#8217;s improvement range from 7-26% in terms of F1 and 8-31% in terms of IoU score.&amp;#160;","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu23-14375,"",,
rayyan-220239244,Preliminary results for dune vegetation identification from high-resolution satellite imagery,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Coastal dunes are important habitats that provide a variety of ecosystem services (ecological, economic, coastal protection, etc.) and, as such, their monitoring is a priority for environmental protection (i.e., EU Directives). Eco-geomorphologic feedbacks between dune plants and coastal topography are fundamental to the self-organisation capacity of coastal dunes and a shift in community structure and composition (i.e., expansion of invasive species) can cause a domino effect, potentially crippling previously established system adaption mechanisms. It follows that monitoring dune vegetation is crucial, especially in protected areas and in fragmented and stressed dune environments. Even though recent improvements in spectral and spatial resolution of satellite imagery open new and exciting prospects for large-scale environmental monitoring, this potential is largely unused in dune ecogeomorphology, due to the challenges related with the small size and density of dune plants and the complexity and heterogeneity of the existing species. Machine learning techniques and subpixel classification methodologies, like the Random Forest Soft Classification (RFSC), have shown promising results in similarly challenging environments in terms of plant size and heterogeneity, with high accuracies in subpixel fractional abundance of marsh-vegetation species. Even though subpixel classification could improve monitoring biodiversity from satellite imagery, similar approaches have never been tested for dune environments. These challenges and gaps inspired the present work, built around the idea of testing subpixel classification methods for dune plant species identification using high-resolution satellite imagery. Here we present preliminary results from the application of RFSC to the western barrier of the Ria Formosa system (S. Portugal) using WorldView2 (2017) imagery and training/validation samples from UAV, along with the next steps planned to test the hypothesis that RFSC methods can be successfully used to identify dune plant species and to assess their predictive capacity and identify potential limitations.&amp;#160;Acknowledgements: The work was implemented in the framework of the DEVISE project (2022.06615.PTDC), funded by FCT (Funda&amp;#231;&amp;#227;o para a Ci&amp;#234;ncia e a Tecnologia) Portugal.

rayyan-220239245,Leveraging advances in hyper-resolution soil moisture and vegetation land data assimilation for S2S hydroclimate applications,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Due to soil moisture and vegetation&amp;#039;s critical role in controlling land-atmosphere interactions, detailed and accurate hydrological and ecological information is essential to understand, monitor, and predict hydroclimate extremes (e.g., droughts and floods), natural hazards (e.g., wildfires and landslides), irrigation demands, weather, and climate dynamics. While in-situ soil moisture and vegetation biomass measurements can provide detailed information, their representativeness is limited, and networks of sensors are not widely available. Multispectral satellite observations offer global coverage, but retrievals can be infrequent or too coarse to capture the local extremes. This observation data gap limits the use of such information to adequately represent land surface processes and their initialization conditions for seasonal to sub-seasonal (S2S) prediction models. To bridge this gap, the assimilation of remote sensing observations into land surface models at hyper-resolution spatial scales (&amp;lt; 100 meters) provides a pathway forward to (i) reconcile model and observation scales and (ii) enhance S2S hydroclimate predictability in Earth System Models.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;To this aim, we introduce a scalable approach that leverages advances in machine learning, radiative transfer modeling, and in-situ observations to assimilate satellite observations into unstructured tile-based land surface models. In this approach, a machine learning model is trained to harness information from big environmental datasets and in-situ observations to learn how the physical model and satellite biases are related to specific hydrologic conditions and landscape characteristics and how these biases evolve over time. We demonstrate the added value of this approach for improving soil moisture and vegetation dynamics at the hyper-resolution scales by assimilating MODIS Leaf Area Index and NASA&amp;amp;#8217;s SMAP brightness temperature observations into the LM4.0 &amp;amp;#8211; the land model component of the NOAA-GFDL Earth System Model. To this end, we performed stand-alone LM4.0 simulations between 2000 to 2021 over the Continental United States, with the MODIS and SMAP assimilation performed from 2002 and 2015, respectively, until the present day. Soil moisture estimates are evaluated against independent in-situ observations. To quantify the approach added value for S2S predictability, we compare the impact of soil moisture and vegetation data assimilation on root zone soil moisture, runoff, vegetation biomass, surface temperature, and evapotranspiration.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-gc8-hydro-82,"",,
rayyan-220239257,Explainable Machine Learning to Map the Impact of Weather and Soil on Wheat Yield and Revenue Across the Eastern Australian Grain Belt,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Understanding the causes of spatio-temporal variation in crop yield across large areas is important in closing yield gaps and producing more food for the growing global population. While there has been much focus on using data-driven models to predict crop yield, there is also an opportunity to use these empirical models to understand which factors are driving variation in yield, and to quantify the contribution. This study uses a large database of 625 rainfed wheat yield maps from 14 different seasons (2007-2020) across the eastern grain belt of Australia. XGBoost models were used with predictors including maps of soil attributes (e.g. pH, sodicity), and weather indices (rainfall, frost, heat, growing degree days). The model and predictors could predict field-scale yield well, with a Lin’s Concordance Correlation Coefficient (LCCC) of 0.78 with 10-fold cross-validation. SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) values, a form of interpretive machine learning (IML), were then used to assess the impact of the variables on yield. SHAP values for each predictor were also mapped onto a grid of the study area for the 2020 season, which showed the impact of each predictor on wheat yield (t ha-1) and revenue ($ ha-1) in interpretable units. Weather variables such as rainfall and heat events had the largest impact on yield. Although generally less significant, soil constraints such as soil sodicity were still important in driving yield. Results also showed that despite their largely temporally stable nature, soil constraints impact yield differently depending on seasonal conditions. Overall, data-driven models and IML proved valuable in understanding the impact of important weather and soil variables on wheat yield and revenue across the eastern Australian grain belt. This could be used to determine the magnitude and economic impact of soil constraints and extreme weather on crops across regions, and inform policies and farm management decisions.","",https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4635928,"",,
rayyan-220239260,Disentangling the influence of vegetation structure and physiology on land-atmosphere coupling,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Terrestrial vegetation is a key component of the Earth system as it mediates the exchange of carbon, water and energy between the land and the atmosphere. Thereby, the vegetation affects the climate through changes in its structure (such as leaf area index, LAI) and its physiology (such as stomatal conductance); However, their relative contributions and respective processes on the land-atmosphere coupling are not yet understood. For instance, increased LAI, referred to as structural changes, promotes transpiration and vegetation productivity, and increases the surface albedo in most cases. In contrast, decreased surface conductance, referred to as physiological changes, could reduce transpiration and productivity. Therefore, the overall feedback of vegetation to climate change via water, carbon and energy exchange will depend on the relative importance of structural and physiological responses. Here we study to what extent dynamic changes in global vegetation structure and physiology modulate land-atmosphere coupling using satellite remote-sensing, data-driven, and earth system modelled vegetation data, as well ashydro-meteorological reanalysis. The land-atmosphere coupling is quantified through the correlation between soil moisture and lagged vapor pressure deficit determined with a moving time window. We employ random forests to quantify vegetation physiology by accounting for functional variability (e.g. GPP and ET) explained by hydro-meteorological data but not by the vegetation structure. Then using an explainable machine learning approach (SHAP), we determine the contributions of vegetation structure and physiology where we find overall larger contributions of structure on regulating land-atmosphere coupling during the growing season. The relative importance of vegetation structure differs across ecosystems, with stronger contributions in dry ecosystems. Furthermore, we analyze the variations of the relevance of vegetation structure over time and in particular during warm and dry periods. The results are partially backed up by using in-situ measurements of physiological traits to interpret the large-scale observed physiological patterns.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu23-10417,"",,
rayyan-220239268,A Study of the Impact of Climate Change on Hydrological Drought Conditions across the World using CORDEX-CORE Simulations,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Rivers have been a vital part of the natural system, favoring the development of different countries and their economies. However, part of the river system may undergo significant changes as a result of climate change, with significant implications for water management, agriculture, and aquatic ecosystems. This study investigates future hydrological drought risks worldwide through an ensemble of regional hydroclimatic projections for different CORDEX domains (i.e., CORDEX-CORE simulations). For this, a river routing model derived from the CETEMPS Hydrological model (CHyM) forced with the CORDEX-CORE total runoff was used to simulate the daily river flow at 0.06&amp;#186; spatial resolution from 1976 to 2099 and under the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5. For the analysis of hydrological droughts, a block minima approach based on the annual minimum 7-day river flow (7AMF) was selected for the nonfrost season (i.e., the period when the upstream area of a given river point presents a mean temperature above 0 &amp;#186;C). These values were fitted to a Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distribution and the minimum flow for different return periods were computed for a reference period and for conditions of 1.5&amp;#186;, 2&amp;#186;, and 3&amp;#186;C above temperatures in the pre-industrial period. Thus, the purposes of this preliminary study were (1) to evaluate the performance of the CORDEX-CORE hydroclimatic simulations to characterize hydrological droughts around the world by comparing the simulated extreme river flow with observations from the Global Runoff Data Base (GRDB) and (2) to project extreme discharge values in order to analyze the impact of climate change on river drought characteristics. The findings of this study could provide valuable information for adaptation and mitigation strategies to climate change from a hydrological perspective.

rayyan-220239293,Using machine learning to quantify multi-scale soil moisture controls on water and carbon fluxes at the land surface,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Knowledge of fluxes of water vapor and carbon at the land surface are paramount to our understanding of the Earth system. Large-scale network initiatives such as the Fluxnet allow us to better understand the environmental controls on the evapotranspiration and gross primary productivity. An important aspect of such initiatives is that its large number of sites allow for localized knowledge to be upscaled to a region or even globally. This can be either done by employing physics-based global land models or empirically, via data-driven approaches. Particularly, we have seen a significant increase of data-driven approaches with the use of machine learning techniques more recently. Here, we use a similar structure employed in the FLUXCOM initiative to focus particularly on the role of soil moisture information in predicting evapotranspiration and gross primary productivity at several flux sites encompassing a wide range of hydroclimates and biomes around the globe. Our analyses employ a machine learning method to a predictive model of evapotranspiration and gross primary productivity, while focusing primarily on how changes in the way soil moisture is incorporated into the methodology affects such predictions. First, we evaluate the predictive power of this model when soil moisture is directly estimated via observations against more indirect estimates via bucket-type models. Secondly, we evaluate the role of the spatial resolution of different soil moisture estimates in predicting both fluxes. We do this by using three sets of direct estimates covering distinct spatial footprints co-located at all flux sites: (1) point-scale time-domain reflectometers, (2) field-scale cosmic-ray neutron sensors, and (3) regional-scale satellite remote sensing products. In this talk, we summarize which hydroclimatic regions benefit from having direct estimate of soil moisture for evapotranspiration and gross primary productivity, while also providing some insights on the possible role of spatial scale mismatches between the fluxes and soil moisture.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu23-12444,"",,

Although recent increasing trends in forest areas were reported by quantitative land cover classification using remote sensing data, the quality of the forest ecosystem such as net primary productivity (NPP) was not evaluated appropriately because of limited field surveys, forest management, and reforestation activities under the complex political situation in North Korea. Therefore, process-based modeling can contribute to understanding the qualitative changes in the North Korean forest. This study selected 14 tree nursery points close to deforestation, considering land cover maps from the Korean Ministry of Environment and recent AI-based forest degradation classification. The tree species of each point were checked by the 2008 North Korean vegetation map and grouped by Maple (Acer mono), Oak (Quercus mongolica), Fir (Abies nephrolepis), and Pine (Pinus densiflora) trees. This study configured current climate data (1960-2010), RCP 4.5, and 8.5 climate scenarios (2011-2100). In addition, vegetation characteristics, soil properties, deforestation information, and reforestation assumptions were selected and fit the Biogeochemistry Management (BGC-MAN) model. In the results, the NPP values were around 3.879-7.169 Mg C ha-1 in 2020, and they changed to 4.774-9.595 in 2100 in both RCP scenarios at each point. The annual average NPP values of 2020 were evaluated at 5.174 and 5.179 Mg C ha-1 in RCP 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios, and the values of 2100 were evaluated at 6.135 and 6.148 in each scenario. Considering the NPP values from the satellite, the overall values were in the range of the NPP data from the satellite-based assessment. The potential net primary productivities were as good as South Korea, which had successful reforestation history. Therefore, proper ecological management planning was necessary using the process-based model, and more in-depth research would be required for North Korean forest management.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu23-10878,"",,
rayyan-220239317,Comparability of Deep Learning Techniques for Calving Front Segmentation in SAR Imagery,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Monitoring glacier change processes leads to a better understanding of how glaciers respond to various external forcings. For sub-annual remote sensing, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery is indispensable, as polar night and cloud cover limit the temporal continuity of optical imagery. Especially with the launch of the Sentinel-1 mission, the availability of suitable SAR imagery has increased substantially. This high amount of data leads to another challenge: Manual inspection is no longer feasible. Therefore, in recent years, many studies applied deep learning to automate the segmentation of calving fronts in satellite imagery. To ensure comparability between different deep learning models, they must be trained and tested on the same data with a predefined test set and evaluated with the same metrics. A dataset intended to be used for this purpose is called a benchmark dataset and needs to provide the ready-to-use satellite imagery and the corresponding calving front labels. Gourmelon et al. [1] provide such a dataset for SAR imagery of calving fronts called CaFFe (https://doi.pangaea.de/10.1594/PANGAEA.940950). CaFFe includes multi-mission data (ERS-1/2, RADARSAT 1, Envisat, ALOS, Sentinel-1A/B, TerraSAR-X, and TanDEM-X), providing a spatial resolution between 6 and 20 meters and covering the period from 1996 to 2020. It contains images of seven glaciers from Antarctica to Greenland and Alaska. For each of the 681 images contained in the benchmark, two labels are provided: One displaying the calving front versus background and the other showing different zones (ocean, rock outcrops, glacier area, and no information available). CaFFe is split into a train set and a predefined out-of-sample test set, which comprises all images from two of the seven glaciers. A split of the train set into training and validation is not specified, as different approaches like cross-validation shall be possible. The benchmark covers a wide variety of different conditions to capture the variability of SAR calving front images. For example, images with open oceans and images with ice-melange-covered oceans are included in the dataset. Especially including images featuring ice-melange is of great importance, as deep learning models have shown difficulties in accurately segmenting calving fronts under this condition. Including images with ice-melange in the train set helps models to learn accurate predictions even under these circumstances. &amp;#160;Adding such images to the test set ensures that evaluated models are able to cope with ice melange. The test set of CaFFe is specifically designed to be challenging, such that the generalizability of models to different conditions and spatial transferability even to other continents can be verified. Gourmelon et al. provide baselines (one for each of the available labels) complementing the benchmark dataset. Current collaborative work aims to evaluate recently published deep learning techniques for calving front extraction on CaFFe and compare it with the baselines.[1] N. Gourmelon, T. Seehaus, M.

Consistent information on forest canopy disturbances is therefore essential to understanding changes in forest dynamics, structure and demography over time and space. As part of the ForestPaths Horizon project we aim to create the next generation forest disturbance maps, extending both the time frame and context of existing pan-European forest disturbance assessments. Disturbances are mapped using the Landsat archive at 30 meters resolution for 1984-2021. A new machine-learning based approach trained on manually labelled reference pixels is applied to the time series, estimating forest disturbances annually and accounting for stand-replacing and non-stand replacing disturbances, as well as different causal agents (i.e., bark beetle, fire, windthrow or harvest). Summarising annual disturbance maps over time ultimately allows to detect multiple disturbance events and recovery signals per pixel and thus for the characterization of complex disturbance trajectories (e.g., multiple fires, thinnings before final harvest). We test our approach at national levels for three countries accounting for three forest biomes: boreal (Finland), temperate (Germany) and Mediterranean (Spain); covering a total land area of 1,194,526 km2 and a total of 65,623 Landsat images. The results from those initial tests will provide information on the accuracy and precision of the annual, wall-to-wall maps of forest disturbances and pave the road for a consistent disturbance monitoring system of all of Europe&amp;#8217;s forests.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu23-2769,"",,

Although the impacts of floods and droughts are equally important and severe, they are typically treated as separate phenomena due to their hydrological differences. However, in order to address and mitigate their impacts, it is important to analyse and model the interactions between the spatial and temporal characteristics of the events, not only separately but also in a joint framework. Moreover, understanding and simulating the effects of land-use land-cover changes on extreme events dynamics is crucial to improve the development of land use policies and risk management plans. The Central America Dry Corridor (CADC) is one of the regions in the world with the highest vulnerability to floods and droughts due to its marked precipitation seasonality and climate variability. Land use change is also an important variable in this mainly rural area, in which forest cover has declined rapidly during the last decades, modifying basin runoff and affecting extreme events generation. Therefore, this study proposes a methodology to analyse and represent in a joint framework the spatio-temporal characteristics of CADC&amp;#8217;s floods and droughts, and identify their relationship with land-use land-cover change patterns. To achieve this, a hybrid modelling framework that integrates Machine Learning (ML) techniques with a spatially distributed hydrological model is presented. It is expected that the integration of ML techniques increases hydrological model capabilities to accurately simulate the effects of land-use land-cover change on floods and droughts propagation. It is also expected that the hybrid model can be used as a tool to assess the effectiveness of different risk management measures and land use policies in floods and droughts mitigation.&amp;#160;","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu23-13167,"",,

Observations are needed to understand and document these impacts and its causes. Such observations are increasingly based on remote sensing from satellites which offer global scale and continuous coverage. Only long-term and consistent observations of the Earth system allow us to quantify climate variability and change and their impacts on the natural and human dimension. Since more than 20 years, the European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT) Satellite Application Facility on Climate Monitoring (CM&amp;#160;SAF, https://www.cmsaf.eu) develops capabilities for a sustained generation and provision of Climate Data Records (CDRs) derived from primarily operational meteorological satellites. The product portfolio of the CM&amp;#160;SAF comprises long time series of Essential Climate Variables (ECVs) related to the energy and water cycles as defined by the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS). Currently available CM&amp;#160;SAF CDRs include, among others, surface and top of the atmosphere radiative fluxes, cloud products, surface albedo as well as latent heat flux/evaporation, precipitation and freshwater flux over the global ice-free oceans. The recent CDR versions cover the WMO reference period from 1991-2020, and several of the CM&amp;#160;SAF CDRs even have a temporal coverage of more than 40 years. In order to serve applications with strong timeliness requirements, CM&amp;#160;SAF also produces so-called Interim Climate Data Records (ICDRs), which are typically released within a few days of the observations. All products are well-documented, carefully validated and have been externally reviewed prior to product release.

rayyan-220239363,A Meteorology-Driven Lstm For Predicting Time Series Of Vegetation Leaf Area Index In Land Surface Model,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,The leaf area index (LAI) is a basic vegetation structural variable in the ecosystem and climate model. Predicting vegetation LAI time series is essential for understanding the response of vegetation growth processes to climate change. Current predictive numerical phenology models are still subject to large uncertainties. Developing LAI time series prediction models is beneficial to improve the ability of land surface models to predict future vegetation growth. This study develops a deep learning model based on meteorological variables and attentional mechanisms to predict vegetation LAI time series. We tested our ALSTM for different biome types across North America and evaluated the model using satellite and flux tower data. The results demonstrated that the ALSTM outperforms other baseline models. The predicted ALSTM LAI shows high temporal and spatial consistency compared to satellite-based LAI. The ALSTM model can effectively predict downstream gross primary productivity (GPP) when coupled with the common land model (CoLM). ALSTM performs high accuracy in predicting the LAI of terrestrial vegetation and provides a reference for developing biophysical methods to predict future vegetation ecological processes for land surface models.,"",https://doi.org/10.1109/igarss52108.2023.10281840,"",,

Regrettably, a substantial 64–71% of wetlands have been lost worldwide since 1900, mainly due to changes in land use and land cover (LULC). This issue is not unique to Zambia's Bangweulu Wetland, which faces similar challenges. However, there is limited information about the LULC changes in Bangweulu Wetland. Furthermore, finding accurate and cost-effective methods to understand LULC dynamics is complicated by the multitude of available techniques for LULC classification. Non-parametric methods like Machine Learning (ML) offer greater accuracy, but different ML models come with distinct strengths and weaknesses. Combining multiple models has the potential to create a more precise LULC classification model. Open-source software like QGIS and spatial data like Landsat also play a significant role in this endeavour. The primary objective of this study was to enhance the accuracy of modeling LULC changes in wetland areas. A Quad hybrid model, which combined the best selected models: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naive Bayes (NB), Decision Tree (DT) and K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN), was used for LULC classification using Landsat 8 (2020 image) and Landsat 5 (1990, 2000, and 2010 images) in QGIS. Results revealed that the fusion of classified maps of the SVM, NB, DT, and KNN (Quad hybrid model) showcased superior performance compared to the individual models with Kappa Index scores of 0.87, 0.72, 0.84 and 0.87 for the years 1990, 2000, 2010 and 2020, respectively. The analysis of the LULC changes from 1990 to 2020 showed a yearly decline of -1.17%, -1.01%, and -0.12% in forest, grassland, and water body coverage, respectively. In contrast, built-up areas and cropland increased at rates of 1.70% and 2.70%, respectively. This study underscores the consistent growth of cropland and built-up areas from 1990 to 2020, alongside the reduction of forest cover and grassland. Although the water body experienced a gradual decrease over this period, the decline was minimal. Long-term monitoring will be essential for evaluating the success of interventions, guiding conservation efforts, mitigating negative impacts on the wetland ecosystem, and determining whether the reduction in water is a sustained trend or a short-term phenomenon.","",https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4626993,"",,
rayyan-220239419,Can Earth System Models represent the spatial variability of land surface processes over complex terrain?,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The land components of Earth System Models (ESMs) are increasingly used to predict changes in surface climate and hydrological processes at the global scale. However, due to their coarse resolution, these models still struggle in representing the fine-scale spatial variability of key land variables important for hydrological applications, such as snow cover, land surface temperature, and soil moisture. To address this limitation, we test here a sub&amp;amp;#8212;grid model structure recently developed for the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) ESM4.1 land model. This novel model structure employs a machine learning technique and high-resolution terrain data to partition each land surface model grid in a set of land &amp;amp;#8216;tiles&amp;amp;#8217; with homogeneous physical properties, which are then used to learn land processes at scales finer than the nominal land model resolution. This technique is especially relevant over complex terrain, where we can use elevation information to refine model predictions of the local energy balance and hydrological processes. Over each topography-aware model tile, the land model can thus provide local estimates of relevant land variables which can be then combined to produce high resolution maps and learn their spatial variance. As a proof of concept, here we will compare this modelling approach with satellite observations of land surface temperature, evaluating the skill of the model in reproducing land heterogeneity over complex topography regions. This analysis can be extended to other variables of hydrological interest, in particular soil moisture. As land models of increasing spatial resolution are being developed, our analysis here underlines the importance of evaluating not only grid average model output, but also predicted spatial variability using observational datasets.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-gc8-hydro-83,"",,
rayyan-220239426,A new data-driven map of peat distribution predicts substantial unknown peatland areas in Amazonia.,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Tropical peatlands, the most carbon dense terrestrial ecosystems in the world, are a substantial but highly uncertain component of the global carbon cycle with wide-ranging estimates of their total area (441,025 -1,700,000 km2), and total below-ground carbon (105-215 Pg C). Protecting and restoring tropical peatlands can make a significant contribution to limiting CO2 emissions and global warming, but policy instruments such as REDD+ and Nationally Determined Contributions to the Paris Agreement must be informed by high resolution maps of peatland distribution if they are to be effective.In regions such as South East Asia, we have relatively high confidence in existing peatland estimates, supported by decades of research and field data. There have also been recent intensive field efforts in regions such as the Congo basin and Peruvian Amazonia, which have driven the development of more accurate regional peatland and below-ground carbon maps. However, substantial gaps remain in our understanding of the distribution of peatlands and their carbon store in some key tropical regions, including most of tropical South America.Here we collate around 2,000 ground reference points in and around Amazonian peatlands, including data from Peru, Colombia, Brazil and Ecuador. These data are used to drive a high-resolution machine learning model predicting peatland distribution across the Amazon basin. We estimate a total peatland extent of approximately 200,000 km2, greater for example than that of the Congo basin, with Brazil hosting the greatest predicted area. However, a lack of field data, particularly across some regions of Brazil, Bolivia and Venezuela, means that substantial uncertainties remain. We predict large areas of peatland in the Rio Negro basin which overlap with predicted maps of Campinarana or white sand forest habitats, but we do not know what proportion of these ecosystems represent true peatlands and how deep and carbon dense their peat could be. We discuss remaining uncertainties and call for expanding sampling in these ecosystems to better understand these potentially extensive peatlands. The past response of tropical peatlands to climate and land-use change, particularly in terms of carbon accumulation, also requires urgent investigation given that the central and eastern Amazon is projected to undergo more significant climatic change than the western basin.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu23-13963,"",,

Therefore, there is a strong need to persistently monitor seasonal forest changes to understand the forest carbon fluctuation and to better conserve biodiversity and enforce laws. In this regard, the advent of the European Space Agency (ESA) Copernicus program avails a dense time-series of both Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and optical images, globally and free of charge, that enables the exploitation of these images for near real-time forest monitoring. Detecting seasonal forest changes in dense time-series, however, is complicated by fluctuation in the detected signal that is induced by forest phenology change. Therefore, forest disturbance detection methods should account for these seasonal fluctuations to make an accurate inference about forest disturbances. In this regard, deep learning approaches designed for sequential data such as Transformers can be used to implicitly learn the natural forest seasonality pattern in the signal to detect forest disturbances. This abstract demonstrates the efficacy of Transformers to detect seasonal forest disturbance in a seasonal dry-forest region in Bolivia.","",https://doi.org/10.1109/igarss52108.2023.10281936,"",,

Soil carbon plays a key role in the delivery of a wide range of ecosystem services including climate regulation, food production, water quality and regulation and as such is often used as a proxy for &amp;#8216;soil health&amp;#8217;. International initiatives such as &amp;#8216;Carbon 4 per mille&amp;#8217; highlight the potential for carbon sequestration in soils as a mechanism for climate mitigation, and the UK&amp;#8217;s NetZero target depends on significant land-based carbon sequestration. Therefore, a need exists to quantify present-day soil carbon stocks at both regional and national scales to guide policy decisions and provide a baseline to enable estimates of carbon sequestration potential.&amp;#160; To meet this need Digital Soil Maps (DSMs) have gained significant provenance, providing high-resolution maps through spatial extrapolation of observed data to regional, national and global scales. These maps are created by applying data-science methods to observational point data and associated covariates to create a predictive model. The model is used to extrapolate the prediction over the area for which covariate information is available. The predictive models often indicate impressively high levels of accuracy based on test/validation data. However, due to differences in both the range of data, methods and covariates used to drive predictive models, multiple DSMs created for the same areas are unlikely to be identical, which is indicative of the uncertainty associated with these mapped products. Much like with process-based models, there is a need to understand which data-science methodology is most suitable for a given research question and provide clarity on the magnitude of uncertainty associated with predictions.&amp;#160; In this study, we quantify uncertainty in DSMs as a result of methodological choice; we apply several approaches (Random forest, Gaussian Process, Generalised Additive Model, Neural Network and Linear Regression) to create multiple predictive models of SOC concentration across the UK. By allowing the models to select from identical input data we provide a fair comparison of each approach through isolating uncertainty in DSMs as a result of methodological choice. In addition to accuracy assessment of each of the generated DSMs, we evaluate the suitability of each of these methods for DSM application. Most crucially, we highlight the need for caution in relation to the assumed levels of accuracy of generated DSMs when considering only standard validation statistics, and the limitations of these approaches when data has bi-modal distribution, a common feature of data that encompasses both mineral and organic soils. Whilst standard statistics evaluating the overall accuracy of the DSMs are highly significant, levels of accuracy across land use classifications vary considerably.

Shifts in intermittency patterns, for example due to climate change, are problematic. To quantify streamflow intermittency in all of Europe at a spatial resolution of 15 arc-sec (approx.. 500 m), we developed a machine learning approach that combines daily streamflow observations, the output of a global hydrological model as well as other physiogeographic data to estimate monthly time series of the number of no-flow days.Daily streamflow observations at initially a selection of initially close to 2000 stations gauging stations across Europe from the SMIRES, GRDC and GSIM databases were used as target for training the ML model. We selected those stations with at least 18 complete (no day is missing) monthly records in the period 1980-2019. Predictors include monthly time series of simulated hydrological indicators at two spatial resolutions, 15 arc-sec (high resolution HR) and 0.5 arc-deg (approx. 50 km, low resolution LR) as well as static HR environmental indicators (e.g. drainage area). &amp;#160;The hydrological indicators were derived from the global hydrological model WaterGAP 2.2e. Its native LR output including surface runoff, and groundwater discharge was used for computing HR time series of monthly streamflow across all of Europe. A comparison of streamflow observations shows a reasonable fit to observations. HR hydrological indicators include specific streamflow in current and previous months.&amp;#160; Examples for LR hydrological predictors include the groundwater recharge to total runoff ratio and daily streamflow variability with each month.We considered a sequential statistical modeling approach (in the first stage: binary classification, and in the second stage: multiclass classification) owing to the zero-inflated and imbalanced data issues. In the first stage, a Random Forest (RF) model is built up to classify a binary classification of each month as either intermittent (with at least one no-flow day) or perennial. Then, by taking into account only those stations that were in the first step either predicted or observed to be intermittent, we developed another model to predict four classes of intermittency (e.g. with 1-2, 3-15, 16-27, 28-31 of no-flow days per month). A random oversampling of non-perennial gauging stations was implemented for both stages in order to address the biases in the RF model caused by the class imbalance in the training data. Three cross-validation techniques were applied for estimating the model performance, hyperparameter tuning, and model selection, including non-spatial, spatial, and spatial-temporal cross-validations. Balanced class accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and precision supported the model selected.

rayyan-220239470,Monitoring Active Mining Areas in Operation using Sentinel-1 Coherence Time Series,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Monitoring and mapping open-pit mining activity is essential to identify operation sites and unaffected surfaces of mining areas. Vertical displacements of the earth's surface associated with open pit mining can be detected using high spatial resolution Digital Surface Model (DSM) data or based on all-weather Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Single Look Complex (SLC) satellite images using Differential Interferometry Synthetic Aperture Radar (DInSAR) technique. In some cases, activity in an open pit may not be accompanied by changes in terrain heights but cause violations of land cover integrity accompanied by earth's surface texture changes (for example, deforestation or recultivation, violation of quarries and dump slope integrity, changes in surface conditions, hydrological disturbances, etc.) and can be detected using coherence maps generated from SAR SLC data.Coherence is the modulus of the complex correlation coefficient between two SLC images containing information about the amplitude and phase of the radar signal. If there is no surface change between the two survey dates, the coherence values are close to 1. Mining activities change the surface texture, so the coherence decreases to values close to 0. The frequency approach estimates the total changes in coherence over the season. For example, the Temporal Activity Index (TAI) is a relative coherence frequency below a given threshold across the time series of SAR images. In the case of monitoring open pit mining, activity areas with consistently low coherence over a time series of observations are of primary interest.The study area is an open-pit mining area of the Pyh&amp;#228;salmi Mine located in the Pohjois-Pohjanmaa region, Finland.

rayyan-220239476,Historical habitat mapping based on black-and-white aerial photography,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Information regarding the spatial arrangement and extent of habitats in the past is highly important for understanding present biodiversity patterns, assessing restoration potential and fighting extinction-debt effects. Due to increasing intensity of land use, European landscapes have changed profoundly over recent decades, with the trend accelerating following World War 2. Here, we explore the feasibility of deriving a 1946 habitat map for Switzerland compatible and hence comparable with the present-day area-wide habitat map. We take advantage of the newly available orthorectified composite of aerial photographs taken in summer 1946 by the US-Army and provided by swisstopo. The ortho imagery (1 m resolution) is segmented into image objects based on spectral and shape homogeneity for 7 case study areas (320 -508 km2), which represent the main biogeographical regions of Switzerland. Initial training data is derived by manual aerial orthoimage interpretation differentiating 16 habitat classes including wetland, grassland, arable land, hedges, orchard meadows and open forest. A random forest model is trained to classify the segments using variables describing spectral information, image texture, segment shape, topography and climate. To increase the accuracy of the classification, an iterative and semi-automated active learning technique is applied. This technique complements the initial training data with new data for segments with high classification uncertainty. With this contribution, we demonstrate the potential and challenges of object-based image analysis, machine learning and active learning to derive habitat maps from historical black-and-white aerial photography.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu23-6092,"",,
rayyan-220239501,"Ecology of Lake Erie - Nutrients, microbes, algae, and dreissenid mussels: A synthesis",,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"The Lake Erie ecosystem, including its physical, chemical, and biological components, has changed considerably during recent decades owing to human-induced environmental stress (Fraker et al., 2022; Makarewicz and Bertram, 1991; Munawar and Munawar, 1976; Sinclair et al., 2021). While much has been learned from monitoring and research activities, a full understanding of how and why the ecosystem has changed is lacking (Fraker et al., 2023; Fussell et al., 2016; Sterner et al., 2017; Scavia et al., 2023), which has hampered the development of management strategies that can help sustain the integrity of the lake and its valued ecosystem services (e.g. clean water, safe recreation, food production). This AEHM special issue is the first of four focused on Lake Erie, all of which will aim to display the science being conducted to enhance ecosystem understanding and guide management decision-making.This special issue centers on watershed, nutrient, microbial (including cyanobacteria), algal, and dreissenid mussel dynamics, including their causes and consequences. Specifically, it focuses on understanding factors that have driven changes in: 1) nutrient loading and in-lake nutrient dynamics; 2) algal and cyanobacteria dynamics; and 3) dreissenid growth, impacts, and spatial variation. After recapping each paper's major messages and management implications, we offer some concluding remarks.Since the early 2000s, Lake Erie has shown signs of intensified eutrophication, including increases in the extent and duration of hypoxia and harmful algal blooms dominated by cyanobacteria (hereafter, cyanoHABs; Scavia et al., 2014; Watson et al., 2016). Some of those symptoms have been linked to altered nutrient dynamics in Lake Erie's watersheds and, particularly, significant increases in dissolved reactive phosphorus loads (Baker et al., 2014; Stumpf et al., 2016). The source of most phosphorus entering Lake Erie is agriculture (Wilson et al., 2018); however, this source is dispersed across the landscape (Kast et al., 2021) and difficult to mitigate. Thus, delineating the characteristics of watersheds that export the largest amount of nutrients is important to identifying locations where nutrient reduction will be most effective. While reducing nutrient input is critical, the behavior of nutrients once they have entered the lake is likely to influence where and when cyanoHABs occur. Toward improving our understanding of eutrophication, two of this AEHM special issue's contributors focused on identifying causes of variation in the dynamics of nutrient loading and approaches to model the availability of these loads on chemicophysical conditions.Johnson et al. (2023) sought to identify how watershed characteristics have influenced nutrient and sediment inputs into western Lake Erie. To this end, these authors used a suite of physical attributes, land uses, and point-source contributions to characterize seven tributary watersheds, six of which are Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement Annex 4 priority watersheds, and five sub-watersheds. The authors then used principal components regression analysis to determine their relationship with nutrient and sediment yields into Lake Erie. Briefly, their results demonstrated spatial (regional) variation in contributions of nutrients and sediments from each river during 2017-2021 that was related to watershed attributes. For example, nutrient inputs into Lake Erie from watersheds were positively related to the percentage of land supporting cultivated crops and poorly drained soils, with higher slopes and lower amounts of pasture being positively correlated with sediment yields. These authors then discussed their findings in the context of impending nutrient reductions aimed at mitigation of Lake Erie's recent re-eutrophication (Baker et al., 2019), explaining how consideration of regional differences in nutrient and sediment yields could benefit nutrient management planning.While Johnson et al. centered on factors that influence nutrient and sediment loading into Lake Erie, Bocaniov et al. (2023) focused how nutrient (total phosphorus, TP) inputs affect within-lake TP movement and distribution. These authors used an updated phosphorus mass-balance model (2003-2016) to derive TP load-response relationships and response matrices to predict steady-state lake TP concentrations as a function of variable external TP inputs. A key finding is that inter-basin transfer of TP plays a large role in driving basin-specific TP concentrations (e.g. inflow from the central basin contributes ∼70% of the resident TP in the eastern basin). Bocaniov et al.'s modeling also demonstrated that western Lake Erie is likely to respond quickly (93 days) to reduced TP inputs, with longer response times estimated in the central and eastern basins (540 and 303 days, respectively). These authors then discuss how their findings can help guide where in the watershed to manage nutrients and what timeframes may be needed before agencies can expect to see impacts of nutrient abatement efforts.An outcome of excessive agricultural nutrient loading into aquatic ecosystems is enhanced primary production. Lake Erie has experienced increases in benthic algae (e.g. Cladophora), pelagic algae, and cyanobacteria during both past (1960s-1970s) and more recent eutrophication events (Munawar and Munawar, 1996; O'Donnell et al., 2023; Vollenweider et al., 1974; Watson et al., 2016). Lake Erie is a large and complex ecosystem, however, and the specific type or location of algal blooms cannot be predicted by nutrient loading alone. Rather, how and where blooms form will depend on complex processes such as gazing pressure and nutrient availability within the lake, as well as water warming that will interact with high nutrient availability. With this backdrop, four papers in this AEHM special issue sought to enhance our ability to understand and describe the dynamics of primary producers, including algae and cyanobacteria.To help better understand the mechanisms responsible for benthic Cladophora outbreaks in eastern Lake Erie since dreissenid mussels colonized the lake, Depew et al. (2023) quantified the enzymatically hydrolysable portion (EHP) of dissolved organic phosphorus (DOP). Samples were collected during May through September 2019 at varying depths along the north shore of the eastern basin. These authors found that the EHP substantially contributed to the dissolved P pool, with this contribution averaging 53% of the total dissolved P and 63% of the DOP concentration. Hence, a large amount of DOP appears bioavailable owing to enzymatic hydrolysis. This result, combined with the fact that bioavailable DOP concentrations often exceeded dissolved reactive P concentrations, indicates an increased role of the benthic contributions to P bioavailability in the eastern basin since the establishment of dreissenid mussels. In turn, Depew et al. highlight the need to consider EHP when designing management strategies to control Cladophora outbreaks in the eastern basin.In contrast to Depew et al., Hoffman et al. (2023) quantified seasonal nitrification in Lake Erie's water column and explored its potential role in driving microbial dynamics, including cyanoHABs dominated by Microcystis spp. To do so, these authors used the stable isotope, 15NH4+, to track nitrification and qPCR to determine the relative abundances of ammonia oxidizing organisms (i.e. bacteria and Archaea, AOO) during 2015-2017. Hoffman et al. found that nitrification rates were lower during cyanoHABs, suggesting that AOOs were not good competitors with cyanobacteria for ammonia. These low rates can in part explain why cyanoHABs dominated by Microcystis spp. (non-nitrogen fixers) can persist despite low bioavailable nitrogen (N). Further, the removal of bioavailable N via coupled nitrification-denitrification is lower than the increase in bioavailable N through regeneration and external N loading. Using these findings, Hoffman et al. discuss the importance of reducing N loading into Lake Erie as a means to help reduce seasonal cyanoHABs.Hounshell et al. (2023) also focused on understanding cyanoHAB dynamics, exploring the role of P as a driver instead of N. While total bioavailable P (TBP) loading from the Maumee River (Ohio, USA) during spring has been shown to be a strong predictor of cyanoHAB severity in western Lake Erie (Baker et al., 2014; Bertani et al., 2016; Stumpf et al., 2016), much unexplained variation in cyanoHAB severity remains. Thus, Hounshell et al. (2023) sought to identify environmental variables that could improve the predictive relationship between the Maumee River spring TBP load and cyanoHAB severity. Their modeling showed that at both low (< 273 MTA) and high (> 332 MTA) TBP loads levels, no other environmental factors improved predictive accuracy of cyanoHABs in western Lake Erie. However, during years with intermediate springtime TBP loads (273-332 MTA), predictions of cyanoHABs could be improved by considering winter and July TBP loads, as well as ice extent and phenology. While their work is still ongoing, Hounshell et al.'s research highlights the value of both tributary and in-lake monitoring, as well as process-based modeling to cyanoHAB forecasting.Wang et al. (2023) also sought to use modeling to predict the distribution of cyanoHABs in Lake Erie. Specifically, these authors compared the performance of the one-dimensional (1D) Aquatic Ecosystem Dynamics–General Lake Model (AED–GLM) and the three-dimensional (3D) Aquatic Ecosystem Model (AEM3D–iWQ) in predicting cyanoHABs, phytoplankton biomass (as measured by chlorophyll a), and associated physicochemical conditions (e.g. water temperature, nutrients), among other things, in western Lake Erie during 2008 and 2011-2014. By qualitatively comparing their results to in situ observations, Wang et al. showed that the 3D model better reproduced seasonal and spatial variation in nutrients and phytoplankton with less error than the 1D model. Conversely, cyanoHABs were better predicted by the 1D model. As detailed in their paper, Wang et al. explain how the scale at which these models are calibrated can drive differences in model performance. These authors also discuss the implications of their findings for choosing the appropriate model to support management endeavors, including how to best calibrate them to achieve desired goals.The final set of papers centered on invasive dreissenid mussels, which have become a ubiquitous part of the Great Lakes since their introduction nearly four decades ago (Nalepa et al., 2005). Owing to their potential to negatively impact native mussels (Schloesser et al., 2006), zooplankton communities (Johannsson et al., 2000), phytoplankton biomass (Bocaniov et al., 2014), and nutrient cycling (Hecky et al., 2004), Zebra (Dreissena polymorpha) and Quagga (D. rostiformis bugensis) Mussels have garnered the interest of researchers and management agencies alike. Much of this effort has been devoted to understanding the mechanisms that influence dreissenid demographics and impacts of the food web, which are the focus of the last set of papers in this AEHM special issue.To understand the growth dynamics of dreissenid mussels and their impact on phytoplankton in western Lake Erie, Carter et al. (2023) combined field surveys, in situ growth experiments, and laboratory excretion and grazing experiments. Their results, which are important in interpreting two of the remaining AEHM special issue papers, showed that dreissenid communities have lower clearance rates and excretion rates compared to previously reported rates. This understanding, combined with reduced dreissenid densities in Lake Erie during recent decades, led Carter et al. to conclude that the ability of dreissenids to compound the effect of eutrophication that causes cyanoHABs may be less than previously thought (e.g. Vanderploeg et al., 2009; but see Carrick et al., 2023 and Vanderploeg et al., 2023). Carter et al. (2023) acknowledge, however, that the impact of dreissenids could be locally high at times, owing to their patchy distribution across the basin. In turn, these authors stress the need for frequent, fine-scale benthic surveys, which could improve ability to understand and forecast the impacts of dreissenids on the ecosystem.Carrick et al. (2023) also sought to quantify the impact of dreissenid mussels on plankton assemblages (heterotrophs and phototrophs) in western Lake Erie. Using controlled experiments conducted monthly during May through October 2018, these authors show that dreissenids graze actively throughout the growing season, consuming nano-sized heterotrophic and phototrophic plankton (e.g. phototrophic cryptophytes, centric diatoms, and non-pigmented chrysomonads). By contrast, lower clearance rates of cyanobacteria (e.g. Microcystis spp.), dinoflagellates, and some colonial chlorophytes were observed. Carrick et al. further suggest that selective dreissenid grazing on ""non-harmful"" plankton species in the nanoplankton size range, combined with lower grazing rates on larger cyanobacteria and chlorophyte species, could contribute to western Lake Erie's cyanoHAB problem. Notably, the small-scale experimental results of Carrick et al. contrast those from Carter et al.'s (2023) field-based study. This discrepancy highlights the value of both experimental and field-based approaches, as well as the need to carefully consider the spatiotemporal context of the investigation, when to quantifying the role of dreissenid grazing as a secondary promoter (above nutrient loading) of cyanoHABs.Vanderploeg et al. (2023) also used an experimental approach to quantity the impacts of dreissenid mussel grazing on the phytoplankton community. Their experiments showed that grazing pressure on phytoplankton varied during May through October, with grazing on cryptophytes and diatoms being high during late May through early July. Despite cyanophytes dominating the phytoplankton beginning in late July, dreissenid grazing on them was non-existent or low. Interestingly, 16S rRNA gene-sequencing analyses showed a diverse cyanobacteria community with Planktothrix dominating during the spring and Cyanobium dominating most of the summer through fall. By contrast, Microcystis, which is largely thought to dominate cyanoHABs in Lake Erie, only dominated during late June. Further, Microcystis was preferentially rejected by Quagga Mussels relative to other cyanobacteria. Using these findings, Vanderploeg et al. draw a similar conclusion as Carrick et al. (2023) by suggesting that dreissenid grazing can favor specific cyanobacteria such as Microcystis. Importantly, however, the final effect of dreissenid grazing as a secondary promoter of cyanoHABS depends on the population density of dreissenids, which is currently low (Carter et al., 2023).In this special issue's final paper, Elgin et al. (2023) conducted an in situ study to quantify spatial variation in colonization potential, growth rates, and abundance of dreissenid mussels at two sites with contrasting water-column conditions in western Lake Erie. Despite finding comparable dreissenid colonization potential and growth between study sites, both on and in the experimental cages, Elgin et al. found fewer mussels in the surrounding sediment at the site nearer the Maumee River. These authors use this finding to conclude that water-column conditions appear to favor dreissenid settlement and growth on hard surfaces suspended above the substrate across the western basin, but that conditions on or near the substrate may inhibit mussel settling and growth. Elgin et al. eventually discuss how substrate-driven bottlenecks could inform our understanding of dreissenid recruitment and distribution, as well as nutrient dynamics, in western Lake Erie. These authors also suggest how better characterization of substrate conditions could support dreissenid control efforts.Owing to the impact of humans, the world's ecosystems have been experiencing dramatic change, which has threatened their structure, function, and dynamics, as well as their capacity to support services valued by society. The world's Great Lakes are no exception with these ecosystems being degraded by numerous anthropogenic stressors, including nutrient alteration (both eutrophication and oligotrophication), non-native species invasions, habitat destruction, and climate change, among many others (Allan et al., 2013; Jenny, 2020; Odada et al., 2003). The magnitude, multitude, and simultaneous nature of these stressors have in turn challenged both researchers seeking to understand the dynamics of these ecosystems and agencies charged with managing the valued natural resources (e.g. fish, wildlife) and other services (e.g. safe drinking water, recreational opportunities) that these ecosystems provide (Allan et al., 2013; Odada and Olago, 2006; Sterner et al., 2017). Such challenges highlight the need for continued research aimed at understanding the causes and consequences of anthropogenic change.While all the large lakes of the world have been altered by anthropogenic stress, Lake Erie is among the most degraded. Its susceptibility to anthropogenic stress is largely due to its small size, shallow depth, high connectivity via shipping, and large watershed that supports both large cities and agricultural production (Fraker et al, 2022; Ludsin et al., 2001; Reutter, 2019). Most relevant to this AEHM special issue, Lake Erie has shifted trophic states multiple times in response to human impacts and subsequent mitigation efforts. Prior to the 1950s, Lake Erie was primarily in a pre-industrial state of mesotrophy-oligotrophy and shifted to a state of hypertrophy-mesotrophy during the 1960s-1970s. During the 1980s-1990s, it shifted back to more mesotrophic conditions in response to both mitigation efforts designed to reduce point-source inputs of TP and the invasion of dreissenid mussels. Most recently (post 2000), Lake Erie returned to a more eutrophic state due to non-point source runoff of dissolved reactive phosphorus (Kane et al., 2014; Ludsin et al., 2001; Sinclair et al., 2023; Vollenweider et al., 1974). Concomitantly, Lake Erie has currently been experiencing increases in the magnitude and extent of both bottom hypoxia and cyanoHABs (Scavia et al., 2014; Watson et al., 2016), which are threatening: human health through cyanotoxin exposure (e.g. Francy et al., 2016; Wituszynski et al., 2017); fish populations and the fisheries that they support (e.g. Stone et al., 2020; Wolf et al., 2017); and the regional economy through effects on tourism and property values (Smith et al., 2019; Wolf et al., 2022). These threats have increased the need for the science necessary to make informed management decisions (Fraker et al., 2023; Fussell et al., 2016; Sterner et al., 2017; Scavia et al., 2023), which includes describing the current state of the Lake Erie ecosystem and understanding the causal mechanisms of recent ecosystem change.The contributions to this AEHM special issue have provided new insights into the drivers of nutrient inputs, in-lake nutrient concentrations, benthic algae (Cladophora), planktonic heterotrophs, microbial autotrophs (including cyanobacteria responsible for cyanoHABs), algae (e.g. diatoms, cryptophytes), and dreissenid mussels. Further, each study has provided information that could benefit management, whether it be ecological understanding that could support ecosystem modeling (e.g. quantifying dreissenid distributions and their impacts on grazing rates and nutrient excretion; Carter et al., 2023; Elgin et al., 2023) or tools that could support nutrient management decision-making (e.g. Bocaniov et al., 2023; Johnson et al, 2023), cyanoHAB severity (e.g. Carrick et al.,. 2023; Hounshell et al., 2023; Vanderploeg et al., 2023) or chemicophysical conditions, including algal and cyanobacteria biomass (e.g. Depew et al., 2023; Hoffman et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023). While many additional messages can be found in the papers, collectively, three key conclusions can be made. First, findings from each of the three focal areas of this AEHM special issue highlight the need to consider fine spatial and/or temporal scales in both the watershed and the lake proper. Doing so offers a means to fully appreciate the complex array of processes driving the dynamics of Lake Erie's chemicophysical conditions and lower food web (e.g. primary producers, dreissenid mussels). Second, while the papers in this special issue showed the value of field-, laboratory-, and modeling-based research to describing, understanding, or predicting ecosystem conditions, they also pointed to challenges that can arise when integrating findings. For example, discrepancies can arise owing to studies being conducted in different settings (e.g. in the laboratory vs. in the field) or at different spatiotemporal scales (e.g. see Carrick et al., 2023; Carter et al., 2023; Vanderploeg et al., 2023). Finally, most papers demonstrated the need for continued and intensified monitoring (e.g. broader coverage at finer spatial and temporal scales), which will challenge agencies responsible for tracking ecosystem conditions. We expect, however, that continued improvement in our ability to cost-effectively monitor Lake Erie and its watershed via remote sensing technologies (Yang et al., 2022; Yin et al., 2021), combined with continually improving data-analytic approaches (e.g. machine and deep learning; Sun and Scanlon, 2019), will help agencies meet this challenge.While the research described in this AEHM special issue has addressed many knowledge gaps, many more remain. Our hope is that continued reporting of findings as part of this AEHM Ecology of Lake Erie series will increase our ability to understand and model the structure, function, and dynamics of the ecosystem. Such understanding and tools should facilitate our continued movement towards ecosystem-based management in the Great Lakes, which could help agencies rehabilitate the lake and sustainably manage its valued resources in the face of continued anthropogenic stress.We thank Ken Minns for providing helpful feedback on a previous version of this synthesis.","",https://doi.org/10.14321/aehm.026.04.131,"",,

rayyan-220239648,Deep Learning Techniques for Enhanced Underwater Remote Sensing: Applications in Marine Biodiversity and Infrastructure Inspection,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Underwater remote sensing has become an essential tool for marine biodiversity studies and underwater infrastructure inspection. However, the unique challenges posed by underwater environments, such as light absorption, scattering, and low visibility, necessitate advanced image processing techniques. This research explores the application of deep learning methods tailored specifically for processing and interpreting underwater images and videos. By leveraging convolutional neural networks (CNNs), generative adversarial networks (GANs), and other state-of-the-art deep learning architectures, this study aims to enhance the clarity, accuracy, and interpretability of underwater imagery.

rayyan-220239748,Identifying direct deforestation drivers in Cameroon using deep learning and optical satellite data,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Deforestation rates have been increasing in the Congo Basin in recent years, especially in Cameroon. To support actions to slow deforestation, Earth Observation (EO) has been used extensively to detect forest loss, but approaches to automatically identify specific drivers of deforestation in a level of detail that allows for intervention prioritisation have been rare. In this paper, we use deep learning to classify direct deforestation drivers in Cameroon and create a country-specific dataset for this task. We also compare the effectiveness of two types of freely available optical satellite imagery: Landsat-8 (pan-sharpened to a 15 m spatial resolution) and NCIFI PlanetScope (4.77 m spatial resolution). Our detailed classification strategy includes 15 direct deforestation drivers for forest loss events taking place between 2015 and 2020. We obtain an overall accuracy of 82% (F1-score: 0.82) with Landsat-8 data and an overall accuracy of 76% (F1-score: 0.76) for NICFI PlanetScope. Despite a coarser spatial resolution, Landsat-8 performs better than NICFI PlanetScope overall, including for small-scale drivers, although results vary by class. With Landsat-8, using only a single-image approach, we achieve an accuracy of at least 70% for all classes except for &amp;#8216;Hunting&amp;#8217;, &amp;#8216;Oil palm plantation&amp;#8217;, and &amp;#8216;Fruit plantation&amp;#8217;.

rayyan-220239778,Biodiversity Assessment in Drylands Using Augmented Satellite Imagery Through Deep Learning Models,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"As global biodiversity faces increasing threats from climate change, habitat loss, and human activities, effective methods for assessing and monitoring biodiversity are crucial. Drylands are particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, and integrating remote sensing technology with ecological research can help protect these environments. Identification of individual trees and shrubs is fundamental to assess biodiversity and can also improve carbon stocks estimates. However, identifying individual trees using medium resolution satellite images is often not feasible. The use of advanced technologies, such as machine learning and satellite imagery in environmental management plays a key role in biodiversity conservation and can potentially fill this gap. The use of readily available Maxar satellite imagery makes conservation approaches accessible and cost-effective, which is crucial for widespread adoption, especially in resource-limited settings or for large-scale studies. This study aims to improve the identification of vegetation in dryland ecosystems by integrating deep learning methods to remote sensing. The primary objective was to distinguish vegetation from rocks or shadows in these areas, which is often challenging due to the dark appearance of vegetation and the similar visual features of the landscape, such as landforms textures, water bodies or man-made objects.. To address this challenge, a Vision Transformer (ViT) deep learning model was developed to estimate near infrared (NIR) spectral bands from high resolution Maxar Satellite images. By enhancing the spectral richness, the model aids in the differentiation of vegetation. Maxar satellite imagery was primarily used because of its accessibility through Google services, making it ideal for planning initial surveys to identify areas of interest for more detailed study. The accuracy of the model was validated against high-resolution SkySat NIR imagery, and achieved an R2 of 0.92. The obtained NIR band helped to clearly distinguish vegetation from non-vegetative surfaces such as soil, rocks, and water, which were not as discernible in RGB imagery alone. The use of a deep learning method to estimate a synthetic NIR band proved to be cost-effective and efficient for large-scale identification of individual trees and shrubs in drylands, overcoming the limitations of medium-resolution satellite imagery. The findings of the study are crucial to the conservation of biodiversity and offer a practical approach for environmentalists and researchers. Future work includes expanding the dataset to include various dryland environments, and integrating additional data sources such as soil data and topographic features for a more comprehensive analysis.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu24-20836,"",,

As we approach the short- to medium-term implementation deadlines of major international biodiversity agreements, such as the United Nation's Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework and the European biodiversity strategy, there is a pressing need for high-quality data products to guide large-scale conservation prioritization decisions. In this study, we present a novel deep learning segmentation approach for detecting high biodiversity-conservation-value forests using a set of remote sensing data products. This approach has enabled us to produce a national data product of continuous coverage for Sweden, with an unprecedented accuracy of 91% and a high-detail spatial resolution of 10-meter pixel size, significantly advancing on existing approaches. Sweden serves as a good test case for the here developed approach, as it is home to the largest portion of Europe's remaining old-growth forests and is also characterized by robust biodiversity and environmental data availability. Our approach allowed us to map over 50,000 km² of high conservation value forest (HCVF) at high confidence, saving more than 750 years of manual inventory effort and significant financial and personnel resources. With its high accuracy and spatial resolution, our data product offers substantial utility for decision-makers at different administrative scales, and directly addresses the goals set by large international biodiversity conservation plans. While this study focuses on detecting high conservation value forests in Sweden, the presented model serves as a proof-of-concept implementation that can be adapted and applied for modeling other regions and biodiversity metrics.","",https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-4734879/v1,"",,
rayyan-220239876,Towards a Deep Learning-based Spatio-temporal Fusion Approach for Accurately Improving Snow Cover Mapping: A Case Study in the Moroccan Atlas Mountains with Performance Evaluation,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Remote sensing technologies provide continuous and detailed observations of various land surface parameters, including snow cover, vegetation, land surface temperature, soil moisture, and evapotranspiration, offering invaluable information at various scales and contexts. One of the major uses is the precise mapping and monitoring of seasonal snow cover dynamics, which are essential for water management and global water balance modeling. Since an intelligent ecosystem based on accurate snow cover estimation requires a collection of high-resolution satellite images, both temporally and spatially, to capture snow dynamics, particularly in semi-arid areas where snowfall is extremely variable. These requirements can be difficult to achieve based on a single sensor, mainly due to the trade-offs between the temporal, spectral, and spatial resolutions of the available satellites. In addition, atmospheric conditions and cloud contamination can increase the number of missing satellite observations. However, there is a promising solution to these limitations. Exploiting the complementary capabilities of the new-generation multispectral sensors aboard Landsat-8 (L8) and Sentinel-2 (S2), with spatial resolutions ranging from 10 to 30 meters, offers an unprecedented opportunity to significantly advance the accuracy of snow cover mapping. Hence, this study aims to investigate the effectiveness of the combined use of optical sensors through deep learning-based spatiotemporal image fusion to capture snow dynamics and produce detailed and dense Normalized Snow Difference Index (NDSI) time series in a semi-arid context. Three distinct deep learning models, namely Very Deep Super Resolution (VDSR), Super Resolution Unet (SR-Unet), and Residual Convolutional Neural Network (RCNN), were evaluated and compared to fuse L8 and S2 data. The findings indicate that all three approaches can provide accurate estimates for a coarse-resolution image at a given fusion date, although there are notable disparities in prediction quality between the different approaches. Specifically, R-squared values were measured at 0.94, 0.92, and 0.96 for RCNN, SR-Unet, and VDSR, respectively, with corresponding root mean square error (RMSE) values of 0.09, 0.11, and 0.08. Our results suggest that the VDSR model is particularly effective in producing high-resolution merged snow time series and can compensate for the absence of ground snow cover data.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu24-13030,"",,

The term “land use” relates to how humans are using the landscape, whether it is for expansion, conservation, or a combination of the two. Human activity on the Earth’s surface alters the land cover area. These adjustments greatly affect how well-functioning vital Earth system components (such as the balance of energy, soil, and water). Applications for remote sensing make it possible to analyses land changes quickly and affordably. Numerous researchers have created techniques for analyzing modifications in the LULC. This study used GIS and random forest machine learning technique to pinpoint the LULC changes in Muzaffarpur District’s urban and rural areas in the span of 15 years i.e., 2005 to 2020. The User land is scattered throughout the western region. The district’s soil becomes more salinized and alkaline as a result of the waterlogging that is also prevalent in some areas of the district. This study’s technique is simple and inexpensive. Between 2005 and 2020, there were major variations in the LULC in the research area. The rise in built-up activity is the main cause of the LULC alterations in the studied region. The current study may not be significantly impacted by the LULC changes. However, to maintain environmentally sustainable development in the future, LULC alteration needs to be continuously watched.","",https://doi.org/10.60151/envec/rodf5502,"",,

Monitoring vegetation is essential for informed agriculture, resource management, ecological understanding, and environmental tracking. Remote sensing data offers valuable insights into plant life, benefiting biodiversity, agriculture, forestry, and urban green systems. In agriculture, this data provides an unbiased foundation for yield management and crop production prediction. Vegetation indices (VIs) are vital for assessing vegetation health, growth, and physiological conditions. They mitigate atmospheric interference and are widely used in agriculture to monitor plant health, estimate crop yields, and study vegetation dynamics, including chlorophyll content estimation. Current techniques such as handheld spectrometers and satellite imagery are effective but limited. Handheld spectrometers require time-consuming field measurements, restricting spatial coverage. Satellite methods face spatial resolution, cloud interference, cost, and real-time insight challenges. Recent advancements in computer vision, driven by machine learning, offer transformative potential. Computer vision can process real-time data from drone imagery and automated accurate VI measurements. This integration opens avenues for precision agriculture and environmental monitoring. The chapter explores the synergy between VI assessment and computer vision, delving into technical aspects, application, challenges, and future opportunities.

rayyan-220240082,Developing an AI Tool for Forest Monitoring: Introducing SylvaMind AI,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Global forests face increasing threats from deforestation, biodiversity loss, and climate change, necessitating innovative tools for effective monitoring and management. Traditional forest monitoring methods, which rely heavily on manual fieldwork and labor-intensive data processing, are often inadequate for addressing the scale and complexity of these challenges. Advanced tools leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) and remote sensing have emerged as critical solutions, offering timely, accurate, and actionable insights to enable efficient ecosystem monitoring, threat detection, and sustainable management practices. This paper introduces SylvaMind AI, an advanced platform that integrates satellite imagery, deep learning frameworks, and geospatial analysis within a user-friendly interface, which was built using Python for backend systems and deep learning pipelines, alongside tools like Pandas, Rasterio, and TensorFlow for data preprocessing and predictive modelling. The platform processes high-resolution data from Sentinel-2 and Landsat missions for feature extraction and predictive modelling. SylvaMind AI offers two modelling approaches: an automated option for non-technical users and a customizable feature for researchers with specialized needs. Using these approaches, we developed a predictive canopy height model for a study area. The results demonstrated the platform's ability to capture underlying forest patterns and provide detailed insights into canopy height distribution, particularly for medium to high canopies (&gt;25m). This underscores its strength in modeling structural complexity in dense forests. However, the model showed limitations in representing smaller trees, attributed to insufficient training data. SylvaMind AI holds immense potential in transforming forest monitoring by leveraging advanced geospatial data, AI, and intuitive design to address critical challenges in sustainable forest management.","",https://doi.org/10.31926/but.fwiafe.2024.17.66.2.3,"",,

The microclimate buffering service provides microrefugia that allow species to persist under climate change, while the ability of montane forests to intercept cloud water from the atmosphere maintains freshwater availability. However, with increasing pressure from anthropogenic land use and climate change, the stability of montane forests to provide such ecosystem services remains unresolved. In this study, we investigated the impacts of deforestation and climate change on the cloud water interception capacity of montane forests in Africa over the last two decades. We predicted 2-m air and dew point temperature using satellite and in situ observations and ensemble machine learning. In addition, we estimated local warming due to deforestation and tested the 'lifting cloud base height' hypothesis attributed to deforestation and climate change separately. Our preliminary results show that 18% of montane forests in Africa were lost between 2003 and 2022, and deforestation increased the air temperature and lifted the cloud base height stronger than climate change. Deforestation weakened the cloud water interception capacity of montane forests in Africa. Overall, this study sheds light on the impacts of montane deforestation on local climate and water supply, which may have far-reaching implications for montane forest biodiversity and ecosystem service provision in Africa.&amp;#160; This work is part of the MOFESD (montane forest ecosystem service dynamics in Africa) postdoctoral project funded by Alexander von Humboldt Foundation.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu24-2927,"",,

Small-scale gold mining is a common livelihood in rural areas, often conducted in forest reserves, cocoa farms, lands along riverbanks, and sometimes within rivers. It involves traditional techniques such as digging pits, washing soil, and extracting gold through sieving or amalgamation using mercury (Hg). However, due to the decentralized and small-scale nature of this practice, monitoring, regulating activities, and making timely decisions become challenging. Consequently, in recent years, gold mining has expanded rapidly into agricultural lands, protected forest reserves, and some parts of the savannah regions leading to severe land degradation, biodiversity loss, pollution of water bodies, and soil acidification, adversely affecting both biophysical and socio-economic environments. To counteract these issues, real-time remote sensing is employed to monitor large and remote active gold mining sites in Ghana. SERVIR West Africa is implementing Earth observation services using Fully Convolutional Neural Networks (FCNN) approach to support decision-making. The data preparation involves digitizing active mining areas, inactive mines, and polluted rivers using Planet/NICFI imagery. The FCNN shows high accuracy in classifying land use features. For instance, distinguishing between mining and farm or forest areas with accuracy matric (F1) score of 0.99, while differentiating active from inactive mines achieved an F1 score of 0.94, and classifies polluted versus unpolluted rivers with moderate F1 score (0.91). The high accuracy of FCNN classifications is attributed to the distinct visual difference between vegetation-covered land features and bare lands (mining sites).&amp;#160; &amp;#160; Keywords: Decision making, Deep-Learning, FCNN, Ghana, Planet/NICFI, Small-scale gold mining&amp;#160;","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu24-12242,"",,

However, the general attribution of deforestation to areas under shifting cultivation is debatable if considering also the component of forest regrowth during the fallow phase, which is an essential part of a mature shifting cultivation system. Yet, little is known about the extent of small-size cropped fields and fallow stages, which are needed to derive information about the temporal development between small-size cropped fields and fallow in shifting cultivation landscapes. The primary objective of our study is to develop a deep learning-based framework to quantify land use intensity in tropical forest nations such as the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) using 4.7-m multi-temporal Planet Basemaps from 2015 to 2023. By employing a convolutional neural network image classification model, we first identified the shifting cultivation landscapes. Secondly, utilizing two-phase imagery, we delve into the temporal development of shifting cultivation, determining whether the landscape continues to be characterized by this practice. Thirdly, the shifting cultivation landscapes were segmented into cropped fields, young fallow, old fallow and old-growth forest/primary forest. Lastly, we used a deep learning regression model to quantify the intensity of shifting cultivation within identified areas. This last step adds depth to our analysis, by offering nuanced insights into the varying practices associated with shifting cultivation practices. Our study in DRC offers a detailed spatio-temporal dataset of the dynamics of shifting cultivation serving as a stepping stone to better understand its impacts on forest loss.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu24-12745,"",,

Smaller and cheaper satellites with reduced operational costs have made a variety of EO data affordable, and technological advances have made the data accessible to a wide range of stakeholders, especially the scientific community (EY, 2023). The NASA ESDS program alone is expected to host 320 PB of data by 2030 (NASA ESDS, 2023). The ascent and application of artificial intelligence foundation models (FM) can be attributed to the availability of large volumes of curated data, accessibility to extensive compute resources and the maturity of deep learning architectures, especially the transformer (Bommasani et al., 2021).&amp;#160; Developing a foundation model involves pretraining a suitable deep learning architecture with large amounts of data, often via self supervised learning (SSL) methods. The pretrained models can then be adapted to downstream tasks via fine tuning, requiring less amount of data than task-specific models. Large language models (LLM) are likely the most common type of foundation encountered by the general public.

rayyan-220240177,Benefits of PRISMA hyperspectral data for tree species classification in an area of high forest biodiversity,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"The Serre Regional Park in the south of Italy (lat. 38.55, long. 16.35) extends over an area of 17900 hectares, largely covered by forests with a high level of biodiversity. The forest cover is mainly composed of about 15 tree species. This type of area is a natural laboratory for experimenting with forest classification techniques. Indeed, this work aimed to test how to use remote sensing (RS) hyperspectral data combined with innovative AI-based classification techniques to classify forest tree species. The potential of RS for monitoring agricultural and forestry conditions is enhanced by the wealth of information provided by hyperspectral imagery (HSI) and new classification techniques. HSI derived from recent satellite missions (e.g. PRISMA or EnMAP) provides information in multiple bands, from visible/near infrared (400-1010nm) to shortwave infrared (920-2505nm). In addition, the last decade has seen renewed interest in Deep Learning (DL) methods. In particular, convolutional neural networks (CNN) have been widely used in the analysis of images.The study area includes the Park and corresponds to an acquisition of 900&amp;#160;km2 of the PRISMA satellite (taken in July 2023). The PRISMA L2D level cube (Cube 1) used in this study was first processed, for format conversion and georeferencing improvement of the image, with a Python script developed by the authors (www.github.com/LarpUnina/PrismaTool). Next, two different techniques were used to reduce the dimensionality. A second cube (Cube 2) was obtained using a band selection operation and a third cube (Cube 3) was obtained using a PCA technique. For the next classification step, both cubes were used as input. Specifically, a Convolutional Neural Network was selected to classify the data using the open source AVHYAS plugin in the Qgis environment. Ground truths were derived from four SAC site plans provided by the Park Authority, covering approximately 9000 hectares, and were split (70 - 30 %) both to train the network and to test the results. The classes chosen for the classification task includes the most common tree species in the Park area: chestnut (Castanea sativa), larch pine (Pinus nigra), alder (Alnus glutinosa), beech (Fagus sylvatica), silver fir (Abies alba), oak (Quercus ilex) and poplar (Populus alba). &amp;#160;Cube 2 gave better results than Cube 3 as input data with an OA higher than 90%. The best results with F1 around 90% among tree species were obtained for Fagus sylvatica, Abies alba and Castanea sativa. Populus alba was the species with less accurate results. HSI contributes to a better definition of the trends of the spectral signature of trees and makes it possible to distinguish even between similar species.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu24-18298,"",,
rayyan-220240200,Merging Earth Observation imagery and model simulations to monitor long-term global snow cover dynamics,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Remote sensing imagery offers a unique tool to monitor the snow cover evolution both at global and regional scales. However, the availability of the time series of normally 3-4 decades limits the applicability of the data to understand the dynamics of snow processes at longer time scale (Pulliainen et al., 2020). In this perspective the possibility to generate hybrid dataset merging satellite records with model simulations is offering the chance to both cross-validate the model simulations and to extent the time series (Lenton et al 2024). In this work, an approach proposed by Notarnicola 2022, with the aim to merge earth observation imagery and modelled data was adapted to generate longer time series. The method is a machine learning approach based on Artificial Neural Network (ANN), where the uncertainties on the ANN trained model were obtained through a bootstrap procedure with a resampling technique. As modelled data, the NOAA-CIRES-DOE 20th Century Reanalysis V3 contains land surface and meteorological maps and their uncertainty available in the period 1806-2015 was addressed (Slivinski et al., 2019). For satellite data, the longest time series on snow parameters were used derived from ESA Climate Change Initiative (CCI) Snow project, namely Snow Water Equivalent (SWE) data available from 1979 to 2020 (https://climate.esa.int/en/odp/#/project/snow). As predictors for the ANN training and test, dynamics variables such as air temperature and precipitation were considered as they regulate the snow dynamics and rainfall events. As static parameters, the location in terms of latitude and longitude, mean elevation, the land cover type, and percentage of vegetation cover were inserted. The target variable to be improved is the snow water equivalent value at pixel level.&amp;#160; Before the application of the ANN approach, a comparison between the SWE values in two data sets for the overlapping period (1979-2015) indicated an averaged correlation coefficient of around 0.52, a bias in the range 35-42 mm, the latter one being strongly depending on the different months. After the application of the model derived by the trained ANN applied to the test dataset, the correlation coefficients raised on average to 0.87, and the RMSE is reduced to around 20 mm. The merged data set will be further compared with ground data where available and then used to derive long-term trends for the SWE variable. &amp;#160; References Lenton, T.M., Abrams, J.F., Bartsch, A.&amp;#160;et al.&amp;#160;Remotely sensing potential climate change tipping points across scales.&amp;#160;Nat Commun&amp;#160;15, 343 (2024). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-44609-w Notarnicola, C.

Annual yields between grasslands vary strongly because their productivity depends on the management and environmental conditions. Information on grassland yields are not freely and extensively available in Germany but would be relevant for comprehensive assessments of grassland ecosystem services including the impact of extreme events on yields. With satellite remote sensing, grassland productivity and yields can be extensively and multi-temporally estimated. Within our project (SUSALPS, https://www.susalps.de/en/), grassland yields are estimated in a grassland-dominated area in southern Germany using ground-truth measurements of above-ground biomass and Sentinel-2 time series data. Field data was collected on 12 differently used grassland parcels in the region in 2019-2021. We aim to overcome limitations of previous research &amp;#8211; caused by the heterogenous nature of grasslands due to varying use intensities in Germany &amp;#8211; by including management information and a large gradient of field samples trough multiple measurements throughout the vegetation growth period into the modelling.

As climate change continues to affect these interactions, identifying the specific drivers of LAC variability has become increasingly important. However, due to the complexity of the coupling mechanism, a quantitative understanding of the potential drivers is still lacking. Recently, deep learning has been considered as an effective approach to capture nonlinear relationships within the data, which provides a useful window into complex climatic processes. In this study, we will explore the LAC variability under climate change and its potential drivers by using Convolutional Long Short-term Memory (ConvLSTM) together with explainable AI techniques for attribution analysis. Specifically, the variability of the LAC, defined here as a two-legged index, is used as the modeling target, and variables representing meteorological forcing, land use, irrigation, soil properties, gross primary production, ecosystem respiration, and net ecosystem exchange are the inputs.

Machine-learning methods, especially deep networks, have strong predictive skills yet are unable to answer specific scientific questions. A recently proposed genre of physics-informed machine learning, called &amp;#8220;differentiable&amp;#8221; modeling (DM, https://t.co/qyuAzYPA6Y), trains neural networks (NNs) with process-based equations (priors) together in one stage (so-called &amp;#8220;end-to-end&amp;#8221;) to benefit from the best of both NNs and process-based paradigms. The NNs do not need target variables for training but can be indirectly supervised by observations matching the outputs of the combined model, and differentiability critically supports learning from big data. We propose that differentiable models are especially suitable as global hydrologic models because they can harvest information from big earth observations to produce state-of-the-art predictions (https://mhpi.github.io/benchmarks/), enable physical interpretation naturally, extrapolate well (due to physical constraints) in space and time, enforce known physical laws and sensitivities, and leverage progress in modern AI computing architecture and infrastructure. Differentiable models can also synergize with existing global hydrologic models (GHMs) and learn from the lessons of the community. Differentiable GHMs to answer pressing societal questions on water resources availability, climate change impact assessment, water management, and disaster risk mitigation, among others. We demonstrate the power of differentiable modeling using computational examples in rainfall-runoff modeling, river routing, forcing fusion, as well applications in water-related domains such as ecosystem modeling and water quality modeling. We discuss how to address potential challenges such as implementing gradient tracking for implicit numerical schemes and addressing process tradeoffs.

rayyan-220240387,Uncovering the impact of hydrological connectivity on nitrate transport at the catchment scale using explainable AI,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Nitrate contamination of water bodies is a major concern worldwide, as it poses a risk of eutrophication and biodiversity loss. Nitrate travels from agricultural land to streams through different hydrological pathways, which are abstrusely activated under different hydrological conditions. Certainly, hydrological conditions can alter the connection between different parts of the catchment and streams, in many cases independent of the discharge levels, leading to modifications in transport dynamics, retention, and nitrate removal rates in the catchment. While enhanced nitrate transport can be linked to high levels of hydrological connectivity, little is known about the effects of the spatial patterns of hydrological connectivity on the transport of nutrients at the catchment scale. In this study, we combined daily stream nitrate concentration and discharge data at the outlet of 15 predominantly agricultural catchments in the United States (191&amp;#8211;16,000 km2 area, 3500 km2 median area, and 77% median agriculture coverage) with soil moisture data from&amp;#160; SMAP-Hydroblocks (Vergopolan et al., 2021). SMAP-Hydroblocks is a hyperresolution soil moisture dataset at the top 5 cm of soil column at 30-m spatial resolution and 2-3 days revisit time (2015-2019), and it is derived through a combination of satellite data, land-surface and radiative transfer modeling, machine learning, and in-situ observations. We configured a deep learning model for each catchment, driven by 2D soil moisture fields and 1D discharge time series, to evaluate the impact of streamflow magnitude and spatial patterns of soil moisture on streamflow nitrate concentration. The model setup comprises two parallel branches. The first branch incorporates a Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) model, the current state-of-the-art for time-series data modeling, utilizing daily discharge as input data. The second branch contains a Convolutional LSTM network (ConvLSTM) that incorporates daily soil moisture series, the fraction of agriculture of each pixel, and the height above the nearest drainage as a measurement of structural hydrological connectivity. Finally, a fully connected neural network combines the outputs of the two branches to predict the time series of nitrate concentration at the catchment outlet. Preliminary results indicate that the model performs satisfactorily in one-third of the catchments, with Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) values above 0.3 for the test period, which covers the final 25% of the time series, and this is achieved without tuning the hyperparameters. The model failed to simulate nitrate concentrations (resulting in negative NSE values) typically in larger catchments. Using these simulations and explainable AI, we will quantify the importance of different inputs, in particular, we tested the relative importance of soil moisture for simulating nitrate concentrations. While the literature shows most of the predictive power for nitrate comes from streamflow rates, we show how soil moisture fields add value to the prediction and understanding of hydrologic connectivity. Finally, we will fine-tune the model for each catchment and include more predictors to enhance the reliability of model simulations.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu24-11159,"",,

rayyan-220240449,"Big Data, AI, and Geoinformatics for Sustainable Agriculture: An Introduction",,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Agriculture contributes significantly to economic growth. Agriculture digitization is a major source of concern and a contentious motif around the world. The world's population is rapidly booming, and with it comes higher demand for food and income. The conventional farming practices were insufficient to satisfy these goals. As a result, new automated approaches were proposed. These new methods met food demands while simultaneously providing career opportunities for people around the world. This chapter is to provide a short explanation of the current incarnation of automation in agriculture. Agriculture entails a variety of processes and phases, the preponderance of which are carried out manually. AI can help with the most challenging and routine chores by supplementing existing technology. When integrated with other technology, it can gather and evaluate big data on a digital platform, determine the best course of action, and even execute that action. Artificial intelligence (AI) simplifies agricultural tasks, such as irrigation, weeding, and spraying, using sensors and other devices integrated in robots and drones. These technologies reduce the use of water, pesticides, and herbicides, maintain soil fertility, and aid in the efficient use of manpower, thus increasing productivity and improving quality. This should be done while maintaining agriculture sustainability and combating environmental constraints such as climate change, water scarcity, and the risk of increasing erosion and productivity owing to extreme weather events. Precision agriculture (PA) arose from technological advancements in the 1980s, leading to the advent of vital technologies such as GPS and satellite photography.","",https://doi.org/10.1201/9781003498452-10,"",,
rayyan-220240491,Deep learning based differentiable/hybrid modelling of the global hydrological cycle,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"The integration of machine learning (ML) and process based modeling (PB) in so-called hybrid models, also known as differentiable modelling, has recently gained popularity in the geoscientific community (Reichstein et al. 2019; Shen et al. 2023). The approach aims to address limitations in both ML (data adaptive but di&amp;#64256;icult to interpret and physically inconsistent) and PB (physically consistent and interpretable but biased). It holds significant potential for studying uncertain processes in the global water cycle (Kraft et al. 2022). In this work, we developed a differentiable/hybrid model of the global hydrological cycle by fusing deep learning with a custom PB model. The model inputs include air temperature, precipitation, net radiation as dynamic forcings, and static features like soil texture as input to a long short-term memory (LSTM) model. The LSTM represents the uncertain and less understood spatio-temporal parameters which are directly used in a conceptual hydrological model. Simultaneously, we use fully connected neural networks (FCNN) to represent the uncertain spatial parameters. In the hydrological model we represent key water fluxes (e.g. transpiration, evapotranspiration (ET), runoff) and storages (snow, soil moisture and groundwater). The model is constrained against the observation-based data, like terrestrial water storage (TWS) anomalies (GRACE), fAPAR (MODIS) and snow water equivalent (GLOBSNOW). Building upon previous work (Kraft et al. 2022), we improved the representations of key hydrological processes. We now explicitly estimate vegetation state that is directly used to partition ET into transpiration, soil and interception evaporation. We also estimate rooting-zone water storage capacity&amp;#8212;a key hydrological parameter that is still highly uncertain. To asses the robustness of the estimated parameters, we quantify equifinality by training multiple models with random weight initialisation in a 10-fold cross validation setup. The model learns reasonable spatial and spatio-temporal patterns of critical, yet uncertain, hydrological parameters as latent variables. For example, we assess and show that the estimations of global spatial patterns on rooting-zone water storage capacity and transpiration versus ET are plausible. Equifinality quantification indicates that the dynamic patterns of the modelled water storages are robust, while there is a large uncertainty in the mean of soil moisture and TWS.

The situation becomes more critical when these hydrologic extremes combine with land use change mainly caused by anthropogenic factors, such as urbanization, intensive farming, and industrial activities. The present study is designed to investigate the combined impacts of climate and land use changes on the future freshwater &amp;#160;stored in the artificial reservoirs of three adjacent river basins located in the central Sicily (Italy), i.e: Verdura (2 active reservoirs with capacities 9.2 Mmc and 4.19 Mmc), Imera Meridionale (one active reservoir with capacity 15 Mmc), and Platani (one active reservoir with capacity 20.7Mmc), using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model. The reservoirs are used for irrigation, drinking water supply, and electric power generation. Future climate variables such as rainfall, minimum and maximum temperatures were derived from an ensemble Regional Climate Models for two main representative concentration pathway (RCP) scenarios, such as an intermediate emission scenario (RCP4.5) and a severe emission scenario (RCP8.5). A coupled multi-layer perceptron neural networks and cellular automata (MLP-CA) model was implemented to simulate future land use of the region considering the CORINE land cover in 2000, 2006, 2012, and 2018 as a reference dataset. The future land use is then projected until the mid-century (2048) in a six-year interval using the validated MLP-CA model. The soil data from the European soil data center (EUSDAC) was used as input for the SWAT model. The result indicated that the basins could experience a decrease in inflows to the reservoirs. The separate evaluation of climate change and land use changes indicated that the effect of climate change on streamflow variation is more pronounced than the effect of land use change only. In this study, we introduced new hydrological insights into the region by analyzing the attributions of climate change, land use change, and coupled climate and land use changes on the future freshwater availability which were overlooked in the previous studies. The implementation of the proposed approach can contribute to design environmentally sustainable and climate resilient river basin management strategies. &amp;#160; Keywords: MLP-CA, Land use change, Climate change, SWAT, Hydrological modeling, Water availability","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu24-4462,"",,
rayyan-220240495,Evaluating Forest Resilience in Europe with Deep Learning Persistence Analysis,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Persistence is a crucial trait of many complex Earth systems. Although connecting this statistical concept to ecosystem physical properties is challenging, it reflects how long the system remains at a certain state before changing [1]. Characterising persistence in the terrestrial biosphere is important to understanding intrinsic system properties, including legacy effects of extreme climate events [2]. Such memory effects are often highly non-linear and, therefore, challenging to detect in observational records and poorly represented in Earth system models. This study estimates non-linear persistence in remote sensing products over European forests and the corresponding hydro-meteorological data using state-of-the-art machine learning methods. Characterising persistence in this way allows us to make inferences on the interaction between forest dynamics, drought-heat events, and ecosystem resilience [3].&amp;#160; Classical statistical methods struggle with non-linear interactions and high-dimensional problems when characterising persistence [1].&amp;#160; While state-of-the-art deep learning techniques have been used to indirectly measure persistence in forests [4], such models have limited potential memory due to gradient instability during backpropagation. Echo state networks (ESNs) provide a different perspective, keeping the weights fixed and training only the network's last layer using linear regression. This strategy circumvents classical training pitfalls such as gradient instability and allows them to maintain a memory of the input system [5]. We exploit these networks to estimate non-linear persistence using the technique suggested in [6], where intuitively, the persistence of the system can be estimated by the model's response when the input fades abruptly. We apply this method to a 30-year archive of satellite derived greenness to generate maps of persistence across Europe and assess the forests' response to changing hydro-climatic conditions. Furthermore, we explore memory changes surrounding extreme events, focusing on recent drought-heat events in Europe. Thus providing an estimate of engineering resilience, an important metric to inform forest management strategies.

The methodology involved supervised image classification using seasonal composites and integrating spectral indices with topographic features to capture dynamic seasonal variations. Historical LULCC analysis showed significant changes, particularly the first decade of the study (1990-2000) marked by substantial forest loss (from 26.6% to 18.7%) and a notable increase in agricultural land (from 27.7% to 43%). These changes were attributed to conflicts in the region and population movements. Subsequent decades (2000-2010 and 2010-2020) witnessed marked forest recovery (24.8% by 2020) and a balance between agricultural increase and loss, reflecting Rwanda's commitment to environmental conservation.

Beyond its high natural, economic and cultural value, this area is exposed to multiple hazards related to floods and &amp;#160;storm surges, droughts, erosion, subsidence, water pollution and loss of biodiversity, exacerbated by soil consumption and climate change; one of the highest threats is the salinization of surface,&amp;#160; groundwater and soils, due to the increasing of duration and extension of salt intrusion from the Adriatic Sea (Enhance, 2016; Allodi, 2022).

For many years this fragile and dynamic context has been under systematic observation, related to salt intrusion as also to liquid discharges, solid transport, topography, hydrodynamics, tides and beach morphology (Visentini, 1940; Cati, 1981).

rayyan-220240618,Methodological Developments in the International Land Model Benchmarking Effort,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"As earth system models (ESMs) become increasingly complex, there is a growing need for comprehensive and multi-faceted evaluation of model performance. The International Land Model Benchmarking (ILAMB) project is a model-data intercomparison and integration project designed to improve the performance of land models and improve the design of new measurement campaigns to reduce uncertainties associated with key land surface processes. While the effort has been established for over a decade, we continue to make developments and improvements in order to incorporate new datasets as well as adapt our scoring methodology to be more useful for model developers in identifying and diagnosing model errors. The version 2.7 release of the ILAMB python software includes new datasets for gross primary productivity and latent/sensible heat flux (WECANN: Water, Energy, and Carbon with Artificial Neural Networks), growing season net carbon flux (Loechli2023), biomass (ESACCI: European Space Agency, Biomass Climate Change Initiative and XuSaatchi2021), methane (Fluxnet), and surface soil moisture (Wang2021). In addition to these land-focused datasets, ILAMB v2.7 marks the first release of the International Ocean Model Benchmarking (IOMB) package. While the codebase remains the same as is used with the land, this release encodes datasets and configuration file to be used in benchmarking ocean models. Finally, we present a shift in the ILAMB scoring methodology. In order to make errors comparable across different areas of the globe, ILAMB originally employed a normalization of errors by the variability of the reference quantity in a particular location. For many variables, this choice tends to strongly weight performance in the tropics and consequently does not give a balanced perspective on model performance across the globe. To balance performance across the globe, we propose a shift to normalize errors by regional error quantiles. We select regions which conform to traditional understanding of biomes in order to focus on areas where we expect errors to be commensurate in the order of magnitude. We then choose a normalizing quantity by taking a quantile of the errors in these biomes across a selection of CMIP5 and CMIP6 era models. In this way, we contextualize the scores by using the performance of the recent generations of models.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu24-20894,"",,
rayyan-220240625,Implementing machine learning technology for smart agriculture based on data collection systems and predictive analytics use cases,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"The need for improved efficiency in the agricultural sector in the 21st century is indispensable to address the numerous challenges, which are faced by farmers in the sector ranging from climate change to pest resistance. Shortage of labor, and the rising demand for food production is adding further strain to conventional agricultural practice. The advent of new technologies like Internet of Things (IoT) and Machine Learning (ML) is providing numerous benefits in agriculture to offset the aforementioned challenges via advanced crop and soil monitoring, automation in agriculture processes, and smart water management systems. For instance, UAVs equipped with sensors are being considered to collect data in real-time via remote sensing technology to monitor crop health assessment on a large scale. In this chapter, smart data collection systems for parameters such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium contents of the soil; average soil temperature; moisture; soil pH, and rainfall are described. Additionally, existing open-source datasets with the aforementioned parameters and crop labels are assessed. Furthermore, suitable ML models for the selected datasets would be described, implemented programmatically, trained and tested. The corresponding results will then be analyzed and discussed in further detail in forthcoming sections in this chapter. This study will provide the reader with a global overview of some existing IoT-based technologies for data collection in the agricultural context as well as some of the corresponding machine learning techniques that can be used in this case. The reader in this chapter will also be taken through the core aspects of the program implementation of the proposed ML model as well as through its training and testing phases including the analysis of corresponding results.","",https://doi.org/10.1201/9781003534761-3,"",,
rayyan-220240632,Data Fusion of Regional Reanalysis- and Sentinel (Earth Observation)-based Products with Machine Learning Tools for Monitoring Evapotranspiration and Drought,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Accounting of the hydrologic process of evapotranspiration (ET) or consumptive use of water is important for water resources allocation, irrigation management, drought early warning, climate change impact assessment as well as in agro-water-climate nexus modeling. In fact, monitoring the United Nations' sustainable development goals (SDGs) that emphasize on improved food security, access to clean water, promotion of sustainable habitats and mitigation of natural disasters (droughts) hinge upon access to better quality data of ET. Though numerous studies have targeted accurate estimation of potential evapotranspiration (PET) using earth observation (EO) data; hydrologists are yet to reach consensus on the best set of predictor variables that can be used irrespective of spatio-temporal scale. This can be attributed to the nonlinear and complex nature of the process of ET. When it comes to the estimation of actual ET (AET), studies employing Eddy Covariance (EC) towers have been successful in different regions of the world. However, the developing countries of the world lack access to EC observations, requiring viable economical methods for accurate ET measurement, even using reliable estimates of PET. The proposed study explored fusion of regional climate reanalysis data, EO data, and machine learning techniques for high-resolution PET estimation. In this analysis, owing to the documented success of data-driven models in hydrological studies, performance of two machine learning models- tree based Random Forest (RF) and regressor Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS), are evaluated for estimating monthly PET. A suite of input predictors are chosen to describe three model categories: meteorological-, EO- and hybrid-based predictor models. There are about 10 input combinations that can be generated for the PET model development, particularly for an agriculture-dominated study region - Dhenkanal district, located in Odisha in eastern part of India. In this study, reanalysis-based (meteorological) inputs at a grid resolution of 0.12&amp;#176; and Sentinel 2A (EO) products at spatial resolution of 20 m have been used. Results of the analysis indicate that solar radiation is the most important meteorological variable that controls PET estimation. Among the vegetation indices obtained from remote sensing data, we find that the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) that represents availability of water in plants and soil, is particularly useful. The best PET estimation model that uses only solar radiation and few vegetation indices (NDVI, NDWI) gave coefficient of determination (R2) 0.88 and root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.14 during validation stage, whereas the use of hybrid predictor model that utilize temperature and vegetation indices information further reduced the error and increased the prediction accuracy (6.86%). When the meteorological inputs: precipitation and wind speed are only used, model did not perform well. Mapping the ET using the proposed models can facilitate reporting of progress in SDG with regard to water use, crop water stress, adaptation to agricultural droughts and food security. In this context, the Evaporative Demand Drought Index (EDDI) is computed across the study region to understand the drought patterns in the region.

Change detection of buildings using Siamese neural networks in coastal environments. In: Lee, J.L.; Lee, H.; Min, B.I.; Chang, J.-I.; Cho, G.T.; Yoon, J.-S., and Lee, J. (eds.), Multidisciplinary Approaches to Coastal and Marine Management. Journal of Coastal Research, Special Issue No. 116, pp. 274-278. Charlotte (North Carolina), ISSN 0749-0208. Change Detection (CD) uses remote-sensing images captured at various intervals to identify gradual and sudden changes in a particular area. It offers an approach to research biodiversity, urbanization, disaster detection, and other environmental changes, including coastal building changes. Traditionally, binary changes and from-to changes are the two main types of modifications that are analyzed frequently. The binary changes consider whether a change has occurred in a specific area. In addition to variations across time, from-to CD identifies particular types of change, such as the transition from buildings to vegetation. Multiclass changes and clustering the observed changes into various groups regardless of land cover type have recently been investigated. Currently, deep learning is utilized in remote sensing for tasks such as image fusion, registration, matching, CD, classifying land use and cover, semantic segmentation, and object-based image analysis. In particular, when deep learning techniques are used to determine changes in multidate remote-sensing images, a new subfield called CD has been developed. Compared to other remote sensing disciplines, CD is still developing. The theoretical foundations of CD were examined in this study through a literature survey in five ways: enhanced information, improved CD methods, performance improvements, CD dilemmas, and possibilities. The CD offers improvements in information representation and CD techniques over traditional CD techniques, leading to improved performance. In this study, CD of coastal buildings was implemented in a coastal area using the Siamese neural network-based transfer learning method. The results show the possibilities for the automatic CD process.","",https://doi.org/10.2112/jcr-si116-056.1,"",,
rayyan-220240660,Long-term hydrological budget over urban areas: approaches and challenges,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Urbanisation substantially alters the permeability of the land surface and modifies the vegetation cover extent and type. These landcover changes profoundly affect the hydrological and energy budget. While the role of urbanization on the local flood response has been extensively studied, its effect on the long-term hydrological budget is much less known as computing the latent heat flux (evapotranspiration) in urban areas is still challenging. However, knowledge on the urban hydrological budget is important as many cities are planning water sensitive urban designs and water harvesting could be key to support an increasing amount of urban vegetation. This study quantifies how urbanization changed the long-term hydrological budget of the island city state Singapore for the period between 1982 to 2021. To do so, we use two state-of-the-art mechanistic models which include all the major hydrological components such as runoff, soil and interception water storage, transpiration, and evaporation. The first is Tethys-Chloris (T&amp;amp;C), which is a mechanistic ecohydrological model that can resolve the water, carbon and energy budgets at high spatio-temporal resolutions but considers the urban effects in a simplistic way by only modifying the impervious fraction of the land surface and its roughness. The second is its urban counterpart, Urban Tethys-Chloris (UT&amp;amp;C), which explicitly resolves shading and radiation reflection within an urban canyon accounting for different urban vegetation types and configurations and explicitly resolves the local urban climate and hydrology. UT&amp;amp;C is however too computationally costly to simulate an entire city at high spatial resolution. Hence, a machine learning approach, where a multimodal neural network comprising a Conv1D layer followed by LSTM layers for dynamic meteorological inputs and Dense layers for static inputs such as urban properties, is used to re-map UT&amp;amp;C outputs over the entire city based on a few selected covariates. By cross comparing the different approaches to compute the long-term water budget over urban areas, we highlight the involved uncertainties, and we can gain insights into the impact of urban development on modifying the water availability in Singapore. The island city-state relies on water harvesting as one source of water supply for households and knowledge of water availability is extremely important for long-term water management purposes.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu24-13909,"",,
rayyan-220240669,Effects of Long-Term Wetland Variations on Flood Risks in the Yangtze River Basin&amp;#160;,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"In the Yangtze River Basin (YRB), flooding is the most frequent natural disaster with enormous socio-economic damages. As a critical component in the hydrological cycle, the wetlands along the YRB have been changing during recent decades because of urbanization, intensive farming (e.g., aquaculture and agriculture) and climate change. Due to the lack of a long-term wetland classification dataset with comprehensive wetland categories, however, there&amp;#8217;s a noticeable gap in the YRB water management regarding the relative roles of different wetland categories on flood resilience. Therefore, this study aimed to generate a long-term wetland classification dataset for the YRB and further investigate the long-term wetland variations on the YRB flood risk assessments for the period from 1985 to 2021. The dataset named Long-Term Wetland Classification Dataset for YRB (LTWCD_YRB) was created using a Random Forest machine learning classifier on Google Earth Engine with 30m resolution Landsat 5, 7, 8 muti-spectral images. The maps of LTWCD_YRB demonstrated the spatial distribution, annual variability, and seasonal cycle of nine wetland categories in the extent, and the total validation accuracy can reach 85%. The LTWCD_YRB indicated that the total wetland area of the YRB in 2021 was larger than that in 1985, with constantly increased human-made wetlands and fluctuated natural wetlands. Aquaculture ponds expanded the most (4,987 km2);&amp;#160;inland marsh in the source region was the wetland category with the most fluctuations. Seasonal changes in wetlands were prominent in the Poyang Lake Basin, Dongting Lake Basin, and YRB source region. The LTWCD_YRB&amp;#160;can offer a consistent agreement of wetland area variations with the other satellite-based wetland datasets in the YRB, which is&amp;#160;valuable for researchers&amp;#160;and stakeholders to better understand the YRB wetlands and would support sustainable wetland management practices.&amp;#160;With the&amp;#160;LTWCD_YRB data as modelling inputs, a GIS-based spatial multi-index&amp;#160;flooding risk assessment model was applied for investigating&amp;#160;the long-term implications of wetland variations on flood risks in the YRB. The model results indicate that in the year with large floods and extremely high precipitation, flood risk level increased obviously after adding the wetland factor. For the years with normal precipitation, flood risk level decreased with wetlands expansion and increased with wetlands shrinkage in the YRB. The long-term expansion of aquaculture ponds contributed to a lower flood risk in the Taihu Lake Basin. In contrast, the Poyang Lake Basin experienced an increasing flood risk due to the long-term shrinkage in lake areas resulting from soil erosion and urbanization along the lakeside. This study would be helpful&amp;#160;for stakeholders to develop feasible wetland management practices, and to improve flood risk resilience in the YRB.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu24-4382,"",,

On 29 June 2023, the EU Regulation on deforestation-freeproducts (EU) 2023/1115 entered into force. The main driver of deforestation and forestdegradation is the expansion of agricultural land for the production of commodities like cattle,wood, cocoa, soy, palm oil, coffee, rubber and derived products. Any trader wishing to sell thesecommodities on the EU single market or export from within it, must prove that the products donot originate from recently deforested land or have contributed to forest degradation.Satellite imagery provides the means of addressing the implementation of the EU Regulationon deforestation-free supply chains, and of strengthening forest governance through theprovision of timely information to national forest services. We present the PyEO near-real-timeforest alert system from Sentinel-2, a current operational application to reduce illegal logging inKenya, and its potential to support im- and exporters in demonstrating deforestation-free supplychains developed by the ForestMind project. The software implementation used the Python for Earth Observation (PyEO) library toautomatically extract information on forest loss from Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. It queries theCopernicus Data Space Ecosystem for new imagery, downloads the automatically selectedSentinel-2 images, applies a previously trained random forest machine learning model to detectforest loss, and generates a multi-layer analyst report.For the forest law enforcement in Kenya, the latest forest alerts are sifted and prioritised bythe Kenya Forest Service&amp;#8217;s Forest Information Centre in Nairobi, and delegated to forest rangersin the field for investigation. Forest rangers navigate to the field site inside the forest reserve,accompanied by a local community scout, and report back to head office with their observationsand whether any arrests for illegal logging were made. Since its introduction in Kwale County in2019, over 2000 forest alerts have been investigated. The dominant cause of the deforestation isillegal logging, followed by charcoal production.For the due diligence application, a Forest Analyst can then use the analyst-report andadditional software tools to create company reports suitable for communication to im- andexporters for monitoring the impact of their supply chains on deforestation and forestdegradation. &amp;#160;","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu24-21708,"",,
rayyan-220240736,Global Land Use Change and Its Impact on Greenhouse Gas Emissions,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"ABSTRACT Anthropogenic activities have altered approximately two‐thirds of the Earth's land surface. Urbanization, industrialization, agricultural expansion, and deforestation are increasingly impacting the terrestrial landscapes, leading to shifts of areas in artificial surface (i.e., humanmade), cropland, pasture, forest, and barren land. Land use patterns and associated greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions play a critical role in global climate change. Here we synthesized 29 years of global historical data and demonstrated how land use impacts global GHG emissions using structural equation modeling. We then obtained predictive estimates of future global GHG emissions using a deep learning model. Our results show that, from 1992 to 2020, the global terrestrial areas covered by artificial surface and cropland have expanded by 133% and 6% because of population growth and socioeconomic development, resulting in 4.0% and 3.8% of declines in pasture and forest areas, respectively. Land use was significantly associated with GHG emissions ( p &lt; 0.05). Artificial surface dominates global GHG emissions, followed by cropland, pasture, and barren land. The increase in artificial surfaces has driven up global GHG emissions through the increase in energy consumption. Conversely, improved agricultural management practices have contributed to mitigating agricultural GHG emissions. Forest, on the other hand, serves as a sink of GHG. In total, global GHG emissions increased from 31 to 46 GtCO 2 eq from 1992 to 2020. Looking ahead, if current trends in global land use continue at the same rates, our model projects that global GHG emissions will reach 76 ± 8 GtCO 2 eq in 2050. In contrast, reducing the rates of land use change by half could limit global GHG emissions to 60 ± 3 GtCO 2 eq in 2050. Monitoring and analyzing these projections allow a better understanding of the potential impacts of various land use scenarios on global climate and planning for a sustainable future.","",https://doi.org/10.1111/gcb.17604,"",,
rayyan-220240784,Revolutionizing Land Cover Analysis: A Systematic Review of Geospatial Intelligence with Classification and Segmentation,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"In today’s fast-paced technological landscape, artificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing industries, with geospatial analysis standing at the forefront of this transformation. The process of land cover classification, which involves categorizing different types of land surfaces—such as forests, urban areas, water bodies, and agricultural fields—has traditionally been plagued by inconsistencies and inaccuracies. These shortcomings have led to a variety of pressing real-world issues. Misclassified land cover data can result in the inefficient allocation of resources, where critical areas may be overlooked while less urgent regions receive attention. Additionally, the failure to accurately monitor land cover changes can allow illegal activities, such as deforestation, to go unnoticed, resulting in severe environmental degradation. Similarly, unmonitored topographical changes, like unauthorized construction projects, can significantly alter landscapes without regulatory oversight, posing risks to both the environment and public safety. Unchecked forest fires, exacerbated by delayed detection due to poor land cover classification, can spread rapidly, causing widespread damage. Furthermore, inaccurate monitoring of border fences can lead to security vulnerabilities and geopolitical tensions. Collectively, these issues contribute to the escalating challenges of climate change and urbanization, highlighting the critical need for more precise and reliable land cover classification methods. In response to these challenges, our study seeks to explore the potential of advanced machine learning (ML) techniques to revolutionize land cover classification. We leverage publicly available geospatial datasets, specifically EuroSAT and DeepGlobe, which provide comprehensive satellite imagery data across various regions. The focus of our research is on two primary tasks: Image Classification and Semantic Segmentation. Image Classification involves categorizing entire satellite images into specific land cover classes, providing a broad overview of the landscape. In contrast, Semantic Segmentation is a more granular approach that labels each pixel in an image according to its land cover class, offering detailed insights into the spatial distribution of different land types. To conduct a thorough analysis, we evaluate the performance of several cutting-edge models in these tasks. For Semantic Segmentation, we employ Meta AI’s Segment Anything Model (SAM), which is recognized for its ability to segment objects within images with high precision, and the U-Net architecture, a model that has been widely used in medical image analysis and has proven effective in various segmentation tasks. For Image Classification, we use the VGG and ResNet models, both of which are highly regarded in the field of computer vision for their capacity to extract detailed features from images and classify them with high accuracy. The primary objective of our research is to assess how these models perform when applied to land cover classification tasks and to identify their strengths and weaknesses in this specific context. By analyzing their performance, we aim to provide valuable insights that can guide future research efforts and help improve the accuracy and reliability of land cover classification methods. Additionally, our study seeks to highlight new opportunities for enhancing the monitoring and management of land resources, which is crucial for addressing the environmental and urbanization challenges that the world faces today. Our research aspires to contribute to the geospatial field by offering practical recommendations for utilizing machine learning techniques to improve land cover classification. By addressing the limitations of current methods and proposing more effective solutions, we hope to support the development of tools that are capable of accurately monitoring land cover changes and responding to the complex environmental and societal challenges of our time.","",https://doi.org/10.5121/ijaia.2024.15503,"",,

rayyan-220240846,Innovative Methods in Grassland Monitoring: Integrating UAV Data for Ecosystem Assessment,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Grassland ecosystems play a vital role in biodiversity and carbon sequestration, but assessing these ecosystem services accurately is challenging due to their inherent spatial and temporal variability. Conventional field-based methods are often labor-intensive and may not capture this heterogeneity effectively. Recent progress in assessing grassland ecosystems has utilized a combination of structural and spectral data from Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), showing promise for a thorough understanding of vegetation behavior. However, this method frequently overlooks an important factor &amp;#8212; the horizontal variability within the vegetation, which significantly influences the precision of estimating plant characteristics, particularly in diverse ecosystems. Our study aims to fill this gap by incorporating texture analysis, a critical but often overlooked element in UAV-based assessments. Our research explored the potential of integrating various UAV-derived features to improve the estimation of above-ground biomass (AGB) and species richness in heterogeneous grasslands, key indicators of ecosystem health and productivity. This research investigated the efficacy of combining UAV-derived canopy height, multispectral data, and texture features for AGB and species richness estimation. The study was conducted in a heterogeneous wet grassland ecosystem, using a UAV equipped with multispectral sensors to capture high-resolution imagery. The imagery was processed to extract a range of features, including spectral indices, canopy height models, and textural information using Grey Level Co-occurrence Matrix methods. These features were then used to develop predictive models for AGB and species richness using advanced machine learning techniques, including Random Forest. Model performance was evaluated based on their predictive accuracy and ability to handle the spatial heterogeneity of grassland ecosystems. The study found that models integrating texture analysis with traditional spectral and structural data significantly improved predictive accuracy. For AGB estimation, the best models achieved an R&amp;#178; value of up to 0.84, with a relative root mean square error (rRMSE) of 26.58%. In predicting species richness, the most effective models reached an R&amp;#178; of 0.54 and a relative rRMSE of 31.95%. These results indicate an enhancement in estimation precision compared to models using traditional structural and spectral data types alone. This research demonstrated that UAV-based remote sensing, combined with a fusion of spectral, structural, and textural data, can improve the assessment of grassland characteristics such as AGB and species richness. The findings underscore the potential of integrated UAV-derived datasets in ecological monitoring and highlight the importance of advanced data processing and machine learning techniques in environmental research. This approach offers a promising avenue for more effective grassland management and conservation strategies, contributing to a deeper understanding of ecosystem dynamics.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu24-15919,"",,
rayyan-220240851,More Accurately Estimating Aboveground Biomass in Tropical Forests With Complex Forest Structures and Regions of High‐Aboveground Biomass,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract Accurately estimating aboveground biomass (AGB) in tropical forests is vital for managing the threats posed by deforestation, degradation, and climate change. However, challenges persist in accurately estimating AGB in high AGB regions. This study aims to accurately estimate the AGB of regions with high AGB by using spatial statistical analyses based on AGB estimates made by machine‐learning fusion of multisource data. We hypothesize that incorporating dominant auxiliary factors in the analysis increases the estimation accuracy. This study focuses on tropical forests located in Longyan, Fujian Province, China, covering an area of 19,028 km 2 . Multisource data are used, including airborne laser scanning, the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission digital elevation model, the Landsat Operational Land Imager, and the National Forest Inventory. Based on GeogDetector's spatial covariance matrix and the spatial similarity principle, we identify key auxiliary factors (dominant tree species, canopy closure, and herbaceous cover) and investigated how auxiliary variables can improve estimation accuracy. Empirical Bayesian kriging regression prediction introduces the main auxiliary factors to refine AGB estimates. These refinements significantly enhance the accuracy of AGB estimates, particularly for high AGB, resulting in a 0.1 increase in R 2 , a 7.0% reduction in root mean square error, a 13.5% reduction in mean square error, and a 6.6% reduction in mean absolute error when compared with the AGB estimates obtained by using machine learning to fuse multisource data. Thus, incorporating spatial statistical analysis into the integration of multisource data and machine learning for AGB estimation can enhance the accuracy of high‐AGB estimates in intricate forest structures, resulting in precise AGB maps.","",https://doi.org/10.1029/2023jg007864,"",,

Scientists and decision-makers are working to address issues of resource conservation and agricultural productivity, with a growing interest in coupling hydrological and crop models. The current trend of interest seems to be limited to the improvement of crop system performance and environmental impact assessment, but attention also needs to be paid to sustainable crop production and water management concerns. Driven by these needs, in the framework of I4DP-SCIENCE program, the Italian Space Agency (ASI) supports the ambitious collaborative project THETIS (Earth Observation for the Early forecasT of Irrigation needS; Agreement n. 2023-52-HH.0), involving the National Research Council &amp;#8211; Institute for Electromagnetic Sensing of the Environment (CNR-IREA), the Council for Agricultural Research and Economics (CREA), the Polytechnic of Bari, the University of Bari, and the Reclamation Consortium of the Capitanata, Foggia, Italy. The project focuses on the early assessment and forecasting of irrigation needs in the &amp;#8220;Fortore&amp;#8221; irrigation district in the Apulian Tavoliere (Southern Italy). THETIS aims to develop a Spatial Decision Support System (SDSS) integrating hydrologic and crop growth models with advanced Earth Observation (EO) products, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and a WEBGIS interface to provide basin-scale information for the efficient planning of irrigation resources for three different use cases (i.e., early forecasting, irrigation start and mid-season estimation) for different target crops. The project architecture significantly relies on the use of EO derived products obtained through the integrated use of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), multispectral and hyperspectral data. They serve the purpose of describing land surface processes and represent crucial parameters for hydrological and crop growth model constraints. Specifically, the calibration of the hydrological model spans from summer 2021 to autumn 2022. The subsequent phase will include a validation phase (year 2023) and an operational phase to estimate water use for the upcoming irrigation season. The validation of the model outputs includes the comparison of the estimated water demand with the actual irrigation volumes applied by the Consortium. A primary focus of the proposed architecture lies in generating time-series estimates of root zone soil moisture, essential for defining the initial conditions in the crop growth model AquaCrop which plays a pivotal role in managing the water balance at the field scale in the areas relevant to irrigation needs assessment. To achieve this goal, the project aims to integrate, for the first time, a revised version of the well-known daily basin-scale hydrological model DREAM with the physically based Soil Moisture Accounting and Routing (SMAR) model. This work concerns data selection and assessment for calibration and validation phases of the basin-scale hydrological model and the SMAR model. They include sparse daily field measurements and satellite data retrievals. Although field monitoring remains essential, preliminary results regarding the use of satellite-derived and downscaled products for a proper model calibration are encouraging. The proposed approach shows promise for providing insights into soil dynamics for operational implementation, supporting advances in sustainable agricultural techniques and rational water resource management in semi-arid environments.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu24-18407,"",,

Greenhouses, which are essential to modern agriculture, provide a controlled environment that promotes plant growth, extends the growing season and protects crops from extreme weather conditions. The integration of photovoltaic (PV) systems into these greenhouse structures is a forward-thinking move toward sustainable and energy-efficient agricultural practises. The REGACE project, funded by Horizon Europe, aims to develop and validate a new technology, i.e. a responsive tracking system placed inside the greenhouse driven by a PLC controller that changes the angle of the tracking system according to the needs of the plants, while enabling the continuous production of renewable energy in greenhouses throughout the year, supporting uninterrupted food production without the constraints of energy availability.In this progressive and dynamic context, we are advancing the development and testing of a Digital Twin (DT) ecosystem. This DT ecosystem simulates the energy production of PV greenhouse systems under specific internal conditions and external meteorological forcings. This paper presents our results from the use of Deep and Shallow Neural Networks (DSNN) to model the environmental conditions in these greenhouses. These networks improve our understanding of microclimatic variables and can lead to more general control strategies that optimise both crop yield and energy consumption.Preliminary results indicate that Deep and Shallow Neural Networks (DSNN), like traditional complex physical models, can effectively model the internal conditions of greenhouses with relatively low error and strong correlationpredictive capability, but with less computational effort. These results were derived from data collected during the summer at one of the pilot sites in Greece. The DSNN skilfully captures the variability of internal thermodynamic parameters, which is crucial for the management of external environmental influences and internal systems such as cooling and shading.The next steps aim to integrate the modelling of plant, water and energy balances within the greenhouse environment. This extended model will be further validated in the first pilot plant in Greece as well as at five other greenhouse sites involved in the project.

rayyan-220240908,Effects of climate and land use on water balance and water quality in selected European lakes,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Lakes, natural or artificial, are important sources of freshwater and are frequently managed to provide ecosystem services. Consequently, the water balance and water quality in lake ecosystems could be subject to different stressors associated to physical, chemical, or anthropogenic activities. Therefore, this study provides insights into the factors that influence the water balance of selected European lakes and their implications on water quality. An analysis of isotopic, chemical, and land use data using statistical and artificial intelligence models showed that climate, in particular air temperature and precipitation, played a key role in intensifying evaporation losses from lakes. Groundwater table depth and other catchment factors also had an impact on the water balance. The study also highlights that lakes at lower altitudes with shallow depths and catchments dominated by urban or crop cover were more sensitive to water balance changes. These lakes had higher evaporation-to-inflow ratios and increased levels of total nitrogen concentration in the water. However, lakes at higher elevations with deeper depths and a predominantly forested catchment area are less sensitive to changes in the water balance. These lakes, which are often of glacial origin, were characterized by lower evaporation losses and, thus, better water quality in terms of total nitrogen concentration. Overall, understanding the relationship between water balance and water quality is crucial for effective lake management and the preservation of freshwater ecosystems.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu24-3402,"",,

In India, nearly 81.4 million ha are undergoing the desertification process. A long-term assessment of the key drivers of desertification and land degradation (DLD) was done over the state of Jharkhand in the central highlands of India. The region is highly vulnerable to desertification and land degradation due to its unique geographical and climatic features, with 68.77% (5.48 Mha) of the total geographical area of 7.97 Mha undergoing DLD. This study aims to quantify desertification in Jharkhand using various satellite imageries and supervised classification using machine learning (ML) techniques. The results showed five distinct classes of DLD cases, i.e., severe, intense, moderate, light, and no desertification. The severe and intense class areas make up about 5.11 Mha (64.43%) of the total geographic area (TGA). The moderate and light classes of DLD make up 0.93 Mha (11.79%) and 1.40 Mha (17.73%) of TGA, respectively. Remarkably, the districts of Giridih, Gumla, Ranchi, Dumka, Jamtara, Deoghar, Garhwa, and Palamu are considered to be the most prone regions to DLD. This study will help to demonstrate the application of remote sensing techniques to quantify DLD-prone regions and severity over the regions, which can help policymakers manage the local administrative bodies and state government departments to demarcate the region to continuously monitor and lay policies to tackle desertification.

rayyan-220240913,SAR-FM: SAR-based flood rapid mapping using multi-modal data fusion,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Adverse climatic changes have increased the frequency of natural hazards, emphasizing the need for timely detection to support effective disaster management and mitigation efforts. Floods are among the most common weather-related natural disasters, causing significant damage to human settlements and the environment. While both Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and Electro-Optical (EO) remote sensing data have been used to detect flooded areas, SAR is preferred due to its independence from weather and illumination conditions. However, detecting flood-inundated areas with SAR is challenging due to volume and double-bounce scattering, unlike permanent water bodies that are easily detected. To address this issue, we fuse SAR imagery with other multimodal data and introduce three novel derived features: Water-Proximity Elevation Map (PEM), Water-Terrain Binary Map (WTM), and Dual-Pol SAR Map (DPM). We also present three deep learning architectures for flood mapping that effectively fuse multi-modal data. Extensive experiments and comparisons with state-of-the-art methods demonstrate that our proposed approach achieves improved performance with significant reduction in model complexity.","",https://doi.org/10.1117/12.3031427,"",,
rayyan-220240929,Deep time plate configurations and their emerging applications,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Plate tectonic reconstructions have progressed substantially over the last decade, incorporating evolving plate boundaries as well as plate deformation. These technological innovations have spurred the construction of a variety of new regional and global plate models. They are acting as a catalyst for the emergence of a new generation of geodynamic models as well as new approaches for studying the flux of material, including volatiles, from the surface to the deep Earth and vice-versa. Plate models with dynamic plate boundaries have evolved to reach further back in geological time, extending into the Proterozoic. Uncertainties in Proterozoic reconstructions are difficult to quantify, but the availability of the GPlates software accompanied by a variety of open-access data sets has enabled the community to develop alternative models, exploring a range of possible interpretations of available geodata to reconstruct plate motions and plate boundary evolution. The emergence of deep-time plate models has opened numerous opportunities for Earth system analysis, including an improved understanding of the evolution of Earth's mantle structure through time, quantifying solid Earth carbon degassing, and linking biodiversity evolution to plate tectonic and surface processes. Three additional developments are significant in the context of emerging spatio-temporal deep-time data analysis: (1) the availability of large open-access geological, geochemical and geochronological databases; (2) the spread of shared open-source software and workflows aiding data analysis; and (3) the rapid recent rise of open AI tools to extract new knowledge from a complex, hyperdimensional data volume through space and time. The pyGPlates and GPlately python libraries have particularly played an enabling role for allowing the analysis of plate models as well as geodata attached to tectonic plates. Together, these developments are catalysing the emergence of entirely new approaches to study deep time Earth system evolution. The applied drivers of deep-time geodata science are to a large extent tied to rapid climate change, the need to better understand potential future trajectories of Earth's surface environments and to enable a transition to renewable energy generation and an electrified transport sector. This transition demands a significant increase in exploration for and discovery of critical minerals below the well-explored surface. It is estimated that at least 384 new mines for graphite, lithium, nickel and cobalt alone are required to meet demand for battery energy storage by 2035. Deep-time Earth models allow the connection of traditional mineral exploration data to evolving tectonic and surface environments, providing the opportunity to build new approaches for better understanding the emplacement and preservation of mineral deposits. The societal and economic need to rapidly reduce our dependence on fossil fuel and to better understand the complex feedbacks between deep Earth, the hydrosphere, atmosphere and biosphere is invigorating the entire field of geology. I will briefly outline some emerging applications of deep-time Earth system analysis and provide an outlook for the future.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu24-4849,"",,
rayyan-220240963,Linking deep learning-based forest cover maps to treeline spatio-temporal patterns,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Over the last decades, the position of the upper treeline in the Swiss Alps has been highly affected by drivers such as climate change and land use change interacting at various spatial and temporal scales. To better understand these interactions, it is necessary to quantify treeline dynamics over large areas at high spatial resolution and over long time scales. This can be decomposed into three tasks: mapping forest cover, delineating the treeline, and comparing the treeline position through time. We leverage archives of optical aerial imagery acquired over the Swiss Alps to map forest cover. These images constitute a large dataset of time series of 12 to 20 ortho-rectified aerial images at 1 m spatial resolution acquired throughout the time period 1946-2020. We have developed a deep learning-based method to automatically extract multi-temporal forest masks from these aerial images (under review). We then explore how treeline dynamics can be characterized using these forest cover maps. More specifically, we look at designing a spatio-temporal processing pipeline that implements widely used definitions of the treeline and treeline displacement, while being robust to potential errors in our deep learning-generated maps, such as noise caused by differing sensors and imaging conditions. We find that through a series of pixel-based processing steps, based solely on the generated forest cover maps and a Digital Elevation Model, we manage to 1. delineate the treeline at a chosen spatial scale and 2. measure the elevational treeline shift between two dates. The flexible choice of the spatial scale enables multi-scale analysis and comparison with existing treeline shift measurements derived from different data sources and methods. We hope that this automatic and flexible spatial analysis pipeline can link deep learning-based forest cover maps to ecologically relevant variables in a way that can foster the understanding of treeline dynamics.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu24-9480,"",,
rayyan-220241032,Unveiling land degradation neutrality: a nonlinear perspective framework for unexpected land degradation in Kazakhstan,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"The unexpected land degradation in dryland regions has become a focal issue of global climate change and human activity since the onset of the Anthropocene. Therefore, conducting land degradation assessments from a nonlinear perspective is crucial to achieve the goal of Land Degradation Neutrality and Sustainable Development Goal (SDG 15.3.1). The monitoring framework that integrates land cover, land productivity, and soil organic carbon has emerged as the primary model for assessing land degradation neutrality, relying on the evolving trends from time-series data. However, these frameworks currently lack time-series data for soil organic carbon and overlook nonlinear state transition thresholds in the evolution of land systems, resulting in considerable uncertainty in land degradation assessments. Here, basing on the space-for-time substitution theory, we establish a framework for assessing land degradation states primarily using static data that are derived from soil organic carbon, net primary productivity, and our obtained physically meaningful endmember fraction using spectral mixture analysis model. This framework emphasizes the nonlinear evolutionary characteristics and thresholds among these three variables to quantify stable and unstable states during land degradation and their corresponding thresholds. Utilizing three widely used data sources&amp;#8212;Soilgrid 250m, MOD17A3, and internally produced bare soil fractions products&amp;#8212;and focusing on Kazakhstan as our study area. Soil organic carbon represents the system state variable and net primary productivity alongside bare soil fraction serve as environmental variables, we identify two state transition thresholds of soil organic carbon as slow variable of complex system (4.1% and 1.6%). This allows us to delineate the study area into two stable states: one representing an ideal state dominated by forest and agricultural land cover (23.72%), and the other depicting a completely degraded area dominated by desert cover (19.71%). The remaining areas between these two stable states constitute the unstable state, posing certain degradation risks. Building upon this, we further utilize a self-organizing neural network to integrate these three variables and assess the degree of degradation in the unstable areas, classifying them into severe, moderate, and mild degradation, accounting for 16.51%, 55.82%, and 27.67%, respectively. This space-for-time substitution method overcomes the challenges posed by the absence of time-series data, assisting a more spatially diversified approach to achieve land degradation neutrality assessment during the Anthropocene.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu24-8355,"",,

Accurate Land Use-specific ETo estimates are essential for sectors like agriculture, forestry, and water management. Leveraging remote sensing technology, particularly optical remote sensing, holds promise in overcoming limitations posed by scarce weather station data and cloud cover issues. The study encompasses a wide array of meteorological parameters, including Solar Radiation (SR), Temperature (T), Relative Humidity (RH), Wind Speed (WS), and Rainfall (RF), gathered from the archive of Public Works Department archives for the period 2016-2017. Employing the FAO Penman-Monteith method, we calculated reference ETo, representing ETo under standard conditions. This involved intricate steps, such as determining mean T, vapor pressure, the slope of the vapor pressure curve, psychrometric constant, net radiation, and, ultimately, ETo. To enhance our understanding, we employed Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR) to model the relationship between predictor variables (VV and VH Polarized sigma naught values from Sentinel-1A) and ETo. We generated equations for both monthly mean datasets and overall study period mean, offering insights into short-term fluctuations and long-term trends. Comparative analyses across land cover types unveiled intriguing patterns. Urban transportation areas exhibited stability, while deciduous forests and wetlands showcased temporal variations. In the ETo comparative analysis, each land cover category exhibited distinctive patterns, providing valuable insights into the dynamics of ETo. Among the land cover parameters, ETo was significantly impacted by relative humidity (RH) (70.80% to 89.89%), and temperature (T). Urban vegetated areas had stable T values (29.37&amp;#176;C), while forests showed dynamic variations in T (24.24&amp;#176;C to 28.94&amp;#176;C). The VH polarization captured a diverse range of climatic influences, resulting in a broader range of dynamic ETo values (7.38 to 10.76 mm/day) compared to the VV polarization (6.74 to 9.34 mm/day). The performance of the VH sensor varied; moderate accuracy was observed in October 2016 (R 2 = 0.50) with slight underestimation (Bias = -0.08), whereas exceptional accuracy was seen in December 2017 (R 2 = 1.00) with positive bias (0.57) and excellent agreement (KGE = 0.92). The VV sensors in October 2016 had a firm fit (R 2 = 0.55), moderate underestimation (Bias = -0.87), and December 2017 showed a good fit (R 2 = 0.57), slight overestimation (Bias = 0.44), and good agreement (KGE = 0.44). Thus, integrating machine learning and satellite imagery improves ETo accuracy for real-time monitoring in adaptive management amid climate change, showcasing sensor-specific variations. For precise estimation of ETo, future research should integrate multi-source satellite data and machine learning, which is crucial for adaptive environmental management.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu24-13406,"",,

Rapid global development has amplified these effects, disrupting key processes that regulate river flows and runoff. LULCC, particularly in agriculture, plays a central role in nutrient cycle and runoff to the water bodies, thus affecting the water quality and ecosystem resilience. Concurrently, climate change intensifies algal blooms, reduces dissolved oxygen, and alters aquatic ecosystems. Shifts in precipitation and rising temperatures amplify pollutant transport and compromise water quality. Moreover, the complex interactions among LULCC and CC have significant impacts on nutrients, pollution concentrations, and sedimentation rates in freshwater ecosystems. This research focuses on the analysis of the dynamics and impacts of LULCC and climate-induced changes on the state of water quality at the river basin scale in Italy, supporting the achievement of good chemical and ecological status of the Water Framework Directive. First, this study aims to analyse LULCC pattern changes across various spatial scales with the use of geoinformation system (GIS) techniques to identify sensitivity and changes at the pixel level within different land use types. This analysis allows the identification of linkages and dependencies between LULCC indicators and their relationships with water quality parameters in each river basin of Italy. Second, to address the compound effects of climate change, this study examines historical patterns of climate change indicators and their correlation with water quality over time. It also investigates the temporal and spatial occurrence of extreme events, which are linked to changes in nutrient and pollutant levels. The final phase of the methodology involves the development of a machine-learning model aiming at understanding and predicting the complex interplay of multiple risk factors such as the combined effects of land-use change, climate variability, and other anthropogenic influences on water quality. By using machine learning techniques, the study will be able to identify intricate patterns and non-linear relationships between multiple risk factors and their collective influence on water quality dynamics.

Nevertheless, the reliability of these models is heavily contingent upon the quality and spatial resolution of the soil information employed. This study addresses the pressing need for robust soil data in SWAT modeling by evaluating various soil mapping techniques.The first objective was to prove different mapping techniques, such as textural class combination and clustering approach using soil grid data to have different soil maps. The performance of those maps, together with WRB, WSR, Zobler, HWSD v2.0 and DSOLMAPS, was evaluated to improve the accuracy and reliability of the SWAT hydrological model. To achieve this, we conduct a comprehensive investigation involving multi-objective calibration, utilizing both flow data and soil moisture data to calibrate the model. Finally we incorporate a &amp;#160;pedotransfer function to include the landcover effect on Saturated Hydraulic Conductivity to improve the reliability of soil hydrological processes in the SWAT model.The study area, situated within the Cauquenes River Catchment, presents a complex hydrological system characterized by substantial spatial heterogeneity in soil properties. The soil mapping techniques under evaluation encompass traditional soil survey data integrated with remotely sensed soil information and machine learning-based soil mapping methodologies. These methods are compared in their ability to enhance the SWAT model's representation of the catchment's hydrological dynamics.In the case of the kmeans clustering approach the results of soil clusters are equivalent to soil units. A number of clusters from 3 to 100 were evaluated with the lowest DB index. Clusters from 3 to 16 presented an optimal range.

rayyan-220241105,Mapping the spatio-temporal dynamics of groundwater-dependent ecosystems (GDEs) with a global groundwater model.&amp;#160;,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Groundwater-dependent ecosystems (GDEs) are ecosystems that rely on subsurface or surface expressions of groundwater. These ecosystems host a wide array of unique flora and fauna and provide **important** ecosystem services. However, GDEs are threatened by the unsustainable extraction of groundwater as well as climate change. Mapping the spatio-temporal dynamics of GDEs and **potential** changes therein under climate change and socio-economic developments is an essential step towards their conservation. To this end, **we have** developed a methodological framework for mapping groundwater-dependent ecosystems using the global groundwater model GLOBGM [1], run at 30 arc sec (~1 km) resolution. The advantage of a physically-based groundwater model over statistical or machine learning methods is that it allows for the reconstruction and projection of impacts of changes in climate, land use, and human water use on GDEs. We distinguish three categories of GDEs: aquatic (rivers and lakes), (inland) wetland, and terrestrial (phreatophyte) GDEs. For each GDE category, we defined a set of criteria for identifying their distribution and degree of groundwater dependence based on groundwater levels, groundwater discharge, and land surface parameters (e.g., saturated area fraction). After calibrating the groundwater model with groundwater heads, we ran the model in both steady and transient states, applying the set of criteria to the model outputs to map the different types of GDEs, their degree of groundwater dependency, and their spatio-temporal dynamics. We validated the model in two ways. First, we compared our simulated groundwater depths against observed groundwater depths. Our model was able to represent observed conditions for about 75% of the groundwater depth locations. Second, we validated the simulated occurrence of GDEs based on the steady-state model runs against the GDE atlas available for Australia [2], where we found a hit rate above 80%. For Australia, our transient runs revealed an overall decline in groundwater dependency between the periods 1979-1998 and 1999-2019, as measured by the average number of months that GDEs are fed by groundwater. This is corroborated by an increase in groundwater depth at the observation wells, indicating that Australian GDEs have become increasingly threatened over the past decades. For the next step, we envision upscaling our approach to the entire globe and projecting the fate of GDEs under different global change scenarios. This, in turn, is a key step towards identifying sustainable groundwater management strategies that contribute to the conservation of GDEs and their unique biodiversity.

Potential evapotranspiration (PET) characterizes the atmosphere's capacity to remove water through evapotranspiration (ET). Evaporation and transpiration processes collectively transfer water from the Earth's surface to the atmosphere with rates determined by solar radiation, air temperature, relative humidity (specifically, vapor pressure deficit), wind speed, as well as the distinctive traits of vegetation, or crops and the practices employed in their cultivation. Estimates of reference evapotranspiraton (ET0) have been widely used across diverse scientific fields and practical domains, with PET measurements and related indices playing a crucial role in agricultural and natural resource management with demonstrated utility on scales from individual farms to regional and global. The aridity index (AI), which describes the ratio of precipitation to PET provides an integrated measure to gauge moisture availability for plant growth, generally of specific reference crops or specific vegetation types, enabling both spatial and temporal comparisons. In an era of rapid environmental and climatic transformations, these metrics, along with their derived indices, assume a pivotal role as direct and critical measures, as well as predictive tools, for gauging the trajectory, direction, and extent of climatic variations and their ramifications for terrestrial, and particularly agricultural, ecosystems.

While in-situ soil moisture and vegetation biomass measurements can provide detailed information, their representativeness is limited, and networks of sensors and field data are not widely available. Satellite observations offer global coverage, but retrievals can be infrequent or too coarse to capture the local extremes. This observation data gap often limits the use of remote sensing information for locally relevant processes understanding and policy implementation. To bridge this gap, recent advances in hyper-resolution land surface models (LSMs) &amp;#8211; operating at the ~100m to 1km resolution &amp;#8211; along with the ever-increasing availability of satellite and big environmental datasets, machine learning, and high-performance computing, provide a pathway forward to bridge data scales. This study highlights recent advancements in plant-soil-water dynamics in LSMs through improved realism in hyper-resolution land surface models and satellite land data assimilation. Previous research enabled soil moisture information at unprecedented scales across continental domains, exemplified by SMAP-HydroBlocks &amp;#8211; the first 30m resolution satellite-based surface soil moisture dataset in the United States. To refine the representation of plant-soil-water dynamics at hyper-resolution scales, we introduce the assimilation of monthly 250m resolution vegetation carbon biomass estimated from satellite observations, such as canopy height (GEDI) and leaf area index (MODIS), into the vegetation dynamics of the NOAA GFDL Earth System Model. We assess how vegetation biomass assimilation impacts root zone soil moisture, runoff, vegetation biomass, surface temperature, and evapotranspiration. By improving the spatiotemporal accuracy of plant-soil-water process estimates at the local scales, we can quantify and map their spatiotemporal variability and scaling behavior, which is critical to identifying freshwater-dependent ecological hotspots. Such advancements contribute to improved capabilities to detect droughts, their impacts on crop yields and ecosystems, and understand their interactions with climate at spatial scales required for many water and food security applications (~100s meters). In a rapidly evolving climate, bridging such data gaps and harnessing the ever-increasing potentials of satellite observation and Earth system models will continue to play a critical role. Integrating these technologies and methodologies offers a robust framework for responding to contemporary challenges in plant-soil-water processes and vegetation and surface water monitoring.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu24-13709,"",,

While remote sensing holds the potential to assess the condition and functionality of global forests, challenges in methodology and technology hinder the accurate quantitative estimation of forest traits from spaceborne observations. The emergence of new-generation satellites and advanced retrieval techniques offers the prospect of overcoming these obstacles, yet the potential of both the data and models requires further evaluation. In this contribution, we focused on retrieving forest traits from PRISMA hyperspectral spaceborne imagery employing machine learning regression models as well as hybrid approaches.

Less performing but still promising results were obtained for Leaf Chlorophyll Content (LCC) (R2=0.44, nRMSE=18.3%) and Leaf Nitrogen Content (LNC) (R2=0.63, nRMSE=14.2%). The comparison of the trait values in June and early September revealed a significant decline in both leaf biochemistry and LAI, which can be traced back to the stress induced in the Ticino Park by the severe drought that hit Europe in the summer of 2022. This underscores the valuable role of hyperspectral spaceborne imagery and new generation models for monitoring forest conditions.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu24-18196,"",,
rayyan-220241221,Remote Sensing Estimation of Shallow and Deep Aquifer Response to Precipitation‐Based Recharge Through Downscaling,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract The Gnangara groundwater system is a highly productive water resource in southwestern Australia. However, it is considered one of the most vulnerable groundwater systems to climate change, due to consistent declines in precipitation and recharge, and regional climate models project further declines into the future. This study introduces a new framework underpinned by machine learning techniques to provide reliable estimates of precipitation‐based recharge over the whole Perth Basin (including the Gnangara system). By combining estimates of baseflow, groundwater evaporation, and extraction, groundwater recharge was estimated over the Perth (testing site) and Gnangara (calibration site) systems using downscaled Groundwater Storage Anomalies (GWSA) from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission. The random forest regression (RFR) model was used to downscale the spatial resolution of GRACE to 0.05° (approx. 5 km), providing estimable signals over the relatively small calibration site (∼2,200 km 2 ) in order to discern any meaningful signals from the original GRACE resolution. Our study reveals that downscaled signals from GRACE can be used to provide precipitation‐based recharge estimates for groundwater systems accurately. However, the growing impacts of climate change, which has led to sporadic precipitation patterns over Western Australia, can limit the efficiency of satellite remote sensing methods in estimating recharge, especially in deep and complex aquifers.","",https://doi.org/10.1029/2024wr037360,"",,
rayyan-220241236,Isolating and comparing the cooling effects of trees and short vegetation in large cities across the globe,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Increasing vegetation cover is regarded as a nature-based solution to mitigate urban heat. Satellite-derived land surface temperature (LST) data at high spatial resolution can indicate comparatively warm and cold places within cities. This offers the opportunity to analyze the cooling effect of vegetation cover, and to separate it from other drivers. Further, it is possible to compare the cooling effects of different urban vegetation such as meadows and trees.&amp;#160; Here, we use daily high-resolution LST data jointly with land cover information from &gt;100 cities worldwide during their warmest three months in 2013. We train random forest models to predict LST patterns from land cover information for each day and city. As a first result we find that random forest models generally outperform linear regression models in predicting LST, and are therefore better suited to study the relative roles of individual drivers. Then, we estimate the influence of tree cover and short vegetation cover on LST by calculating SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values. We find that trees contribute to decreasing urban LST in most cities and days while only half samples indicate decrease of LST caused by short vegetation. Thereby trees have a much larger cooling effect than short vegetation. This is probably related to sustained transpiration during warm and dry conditions thanks to deep rooting systems, which is typically not the case for short vegetation. Also for trees, the cooling effect varies across climate regimes, with the largest effects in cities with temperate climate.&amp;#160; Moreover, we find that the cooling effect of trees is particularly large during the hottest days while it is limited by high relative humidity. This probably reflects the impacts of radiation and vapor pressure deficit on tree transpiration. Overall, our analysis demonstrates how remote sensing data and machine learning methods can inform urban vegetation cooling to deal with more frequent hot extremes.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu24-11630,"",,

This hampers theoretical advances for fire prediction at scale, acutely so where global climate and anthropogenic change amplifies hitherto minor or only-hypothesised processes.&amp;#160; Here, we show that where process representation is task-sufficient and appropriate, global land surface models can step in to infer and resolve these theoretical gaps.&amp;#160; This is possible precisely because these models currently fail to reproduce observed burned area and/or fire intensity patterns in a substantive number of space-time and biome-level configurations, despite reasonable performance at global and annual scales.&amp;#160; These in turn provide clues towards the primary theoretical deficiencies in contemporary fire ecology, as well as a platform for resolving them. &amp;#160; We present two studies that achieve this, which suggest that appropriate construction of model protocols enables hypothesis testing that can reject the null where simulation outcomes simultaneously meet both alternative hypothesis criteria and expected simulation improvements with respect to observed patterns, paving the way for improved theoretical understanding and predictive capacity. &amp;#160; The first study constructs a simplified yet powerful proxy for anthropogenic land fragmentation&amp;#8217;s effects on fire activity at global scale.&amp;#160; Including this complex interaction of increased human ignition potential, fire size constriction, wind infiltration and land surface desiccation drives fire decreases in temperate and cold areas of moderate to high population density, while causing substantial increases in tropical areas subject to high levels of fragmentation.&amp;#160; In aggregate, including fragmentation effects decreased simulated global burned area by -6% and increased it by +5% (-1% net), while 7% of grid cells&amp;#8217; fire activity was affected by &gt;25%.&amp;#160; These results were consistent with both global and regional (e.g. Brazil, Indonesia) -scale statistical and fire-fragmentation relationships.&amp;#160;&amp;#160; The second study provides a solution for representing the critical bifurcation of fire phenomena and severity between boreal Eurasia and North America, previously unachievable in global land surface models. Our solution results in wide-ranging improvements to the simulated space-time patterns of boreal burned area, fire intensity and their divergence.&amp;#160; The initial theoretical gap was addressed by hypothesizing that a previously described (Rogers et al., 2015) vegetation -and hence fire -ecology split between the two continents could be fundamentally defined by a top-down (climatic) signal, rather than the bottom-up (vegetation) driver identified by that study, which cascaded into ground/crown fire probability, fire spread and combustion dynamics.&amp;#160; Process-based theoretical inference, in combination with high resolution machine learning techniques, may pave the way for future advances in global-scale fire ecology.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu24-3376,"",,

Though substantial effort has gone into disentangling how global change will impact the understorey community, the scarcity of information on site-specific environmental drivers together with large temporal and spatial drivers has limited our understanding of how global change drivers affect understorey characteristics at specific forest sites. Here, using understorey resurvey data collected from 1363 plots across temperate Europe and applying a machine learning approach, we used Gradient Boosting Regression Models (GBM) to model and predict trajectories of four understorey characteristics (species richness, total understorey vegetation cover, proportion of woody species and proportion of forest specialists) to global-change and site-specific drivers (e.g. soil, overstory conditions). We applied the final GBM models to 8 forest sites in Austria to evaluate the effect of future scenarios for nitrogen deposition, climate change and forest management on the forest understory in the year 2030, and project the trajectory of understorey properties from year 1993 to 2030.&amp;#160; The trajectory results showed that increasing nitrogen deposition decreased species richness and proportion of woody species, but increased total understorey vegetation cover and proportion of forest specialists. The effect of climate warming on the proportion of forest specialists appeared to be limited but led to a decrease in species richness, total vegetation cover and proportion of woody species. Finally, a closed canopy could shift the community towards more woody species and forest specialists but may lower species richness and total vegetation cover. Our presented model allows the prediction of trajectories of understorey vegetation responses to global change and management interventions at specific forest sites.&amp;#160;","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu24-16274,"",,

Journal of Coastal Research, Special Issue No. 113, pp. 154-158. Charlotte (North Carolina), ISSN 0749-0208. Coastal marine ecosystems provide crucial services to cope with accelerating global changes. Among them, intertidal rocky shores and their canopy-forming macroalgal habitats support a high biodiversity, provide food, offer coastal protection, and multiple cultural services. Due to their location, at the land-sea interface, these coastal areas are threatened by various distal and local anthropogenic pressures. Their monitoring at very high (dm) spatial resolution is necessary to better inform their sustainable management. The very high temporal resolution of the unmanned airborne vehicle (UAV) imagery can be agile enough to monitor intertidal shores during the low tide's short window. Active or passive UAV imagery, coupled with machine learning, has the capabilities to map habitats, but requires ground-truth data, whose amount is strongly constrained by the low tide period. The study proposes to combine quantitative information, collected by trained citizens, with UAV data. UAV-based data were collected using two different sensors: a topographic Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) system DJI L1 and a multispectral imager MicaSense Altum-PT. Linear regressions of the canopy-forming macroalgae cover and the abundance of the gastropod, Steromphala umbilicalis, were run based on UAV by-products. Multispectral orthomosaics better predicted the algae cover (R2 = 0.52) and the abundance of gastropod (R2 = 0.45) than lasergrammetric data (algae cover: R2 = 0.48; gastropod abundance: R2 = 0.42). A combination of both source of data revealed better prediction for the algae cover (R2 = 0.68), as well as for the gastropod abundance (R2 = 0.55). Results are discussed in the light of the cm-scale remote sensing but also in its aspect of environmental awareness and responsive action.","",https://doi.org/10.2112/jcr-si113-031.1,"",,
rayyan-220241547,A Parcel-Based Deep-Learning Classification to Map Local Climate Zones From Sentinel-2 Images,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Local climate zones (LCZ) describe urban surface structures, supporting studies of urban heat islands, sustainable urbanization, and energy balance. The existing studies mapped LCZs from satellite images using scene-based classification, which trained deep-learning classifiers by labeled image patches, segmented satellite images into patches by sliding windows to match the size of training data, and finally classified the segmented patches to obtain LCZ maps. However, sliding windows are different from the real footprints of LCZs, which leads to large errors in classification. To address this problem, this article proposes a parcel-based method for LCZ classification using Sentinel-2 images, road networks, and elevation data. First, the Sentinel-2 images are segmented by the road network to obtain the land parcels as classification units. Second, each image parcel is standardized to match the training dataset, So2Sat LCZ42. Third, the trained convolutional neural network (CNN) is used to classify the standardized parcels into LCZs. Finally, the building height information derived from elevation data is used to refine the LCZs by a rule-based classifier. The results of the four test sites show that the overall accuracy of our method is 0.75, higher than the sliding-window-based method's accuracy of 0.47. Additional simulation experiments demonstrated that parcels derived from road networks can reduce the mixture effect in image patches, and parcel standardization can ensure the transferability of the CNN model trained by regular image patches. Considering that the road network and elevation data are widely available, the proposed method has the potential of mapping LCZs in large areas.","",https://doi.org/10.1109/jstars.2021.3071577,"",,

Crop areas have been recognized efficiently and accurately via remote sensing (RS) and machine learning (ML), especially deep learning (DL), which are too rough for modern smallholder production. In this paper, a delimitation-grading method for actual crop production units (ACPUs) based on RS images was explored using a combination of a mask region-based convolutional neural network (Mask R-CNN), spatial analysis, comprehensive index evaluation, and cluster analysis. Da’an City, Jilin province, China, was chosen as the study region to satisfy the agro-production demands in modern smallholder areas. Firstly, the ACPUs were interpreted from perspectives such as production mode, spatial form, and actual productivity. Secondly, cultivated land plots (C-plots) were extracted by Mask R-CNN with high-resolution RS images, which were used to delineate contiguous cultivated land plots (CC-plots) on the basis of auxiliary data correction. Then, the refined delimitation-grading results of the ACPUs were obtained through comprehensive evaluation of spatial characteristics and real productivity clustering. For the conclusion, the effectiveness of the Mask R-CNN model in C-plot recognition (loss = 0.16, mean average precision (mAP) = 82.29%) and a reasonable distance threshold (20 m) for CC-plot delimiting were verified. The spatial features were evaluated with the scale-shape dimensions of nine specific indicators. Real productivities were clustered by the incorporation of two-step cluster and K-Means cluster. Furthermore, most of the ACPUs in the study area were of a reasonable scale and an appropriate shape, holding real productivities at a medium level or above. The proposed method in this paper can be adjusted according to the changes of the study area with flexibility to assist agro-supervision in many modern smallholder regions.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/rs12071074,"",,

Previous studies on urban biodiversity using acoustics are often limited by data continuity and survey scope, making it difficult to answer questions about relationships between bird population dynamics and environmental factors. To some extent, big data methods such as continuous acoustic monitoring have bridged this gap and provided new research paths to address the problem. In this study, we proposed a machine learning (ML) method that uses convolutional neural networks (CNN) and target sound area ratios (TSAR) to quantify the dominance of seven types of acoustic scenes. Acoustic data was recorded at nine sites in three urban forests in Guangzhou, China. Using the site-related sound data, we trained the convolutional neural network and identified seven target soundscape components with an overall F1 score of 0.97, a precision of 0.96, and a recall of 0.97. Spatial patterns of acoustic scenes in urban forests were examined to understand the effective working radius of monitoring equipment and the impacts of differing land use types on the composition of soundscapes. This study indicates significant interactions between human activities and biodiversity using acoustics, demonstrates that vocal organisms respond to environmental changes primarily by changes in their vocal frequencies, and proposes a novel framework for utilizing acoustics to monitor urban biodiversity. Going forth, these analyses help to promote the conservation of biodiversity and the sustainability of urban development.","",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2022.109437,"",,

After mapping and classifying actual LCC, multi-layer perception (MLP) neural network and Markov chain were employed to predict future LCC for the year 2030. The results indicate that the built-up area increased substantially from 27% in 2008 to 46% in 2017 and is expected to rise to 73% by 2030. In contrast, open-space (10%), forestlands (5%) and grassland/farmlands (49%) decreased progressively (2008–2030). In effect, these land-cover types experienced area turnover ˃100% during the actual and predicted period, indicating high vulnerability of natural land cover to urban growth, ecological degradation and resource depletion.

The specific objectives were to; (i) map the spatial-temporal land use and cover changes (ii) analyze settlements (built-up areas) patterns and factors influencing their changes (iii) predict changes that might happen for the next two decades. LULCC for 1999 to 2019 were detected through Maximum Likelihood (ML) supervised classification techniques while Cellular Automata based on Artificial Neural Network (CA-ANN) model was used to predict future changes.

To date, multiple land uses are experiencing urban construction-related land expansion, population increase, and socioeconomic development. Comprehensive evaluation and understanding of the effect of urban sprawl and its rapid LUCC are of great importance to managing land surface resources for sustainable development. The present research applied remote sensing data, such as Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper and Landsat-8 Operation Land Imager, on selected images between July and August from 1985 to 2020 with the use of multiple types of software to explore, classify, and analyze the historical and future LUCCs in Baghdad City. Three historical LUCC maps from 1985, 2000, and 2020 were created and analyzed. The result shows that urban construction land expands quickly, and agricultural land and natural vegetation have had a large loss of coverage during the last 35 years. The change analysis derived from previous land use was used as a change direction for future simulation, where natural and anthropogenic factors were selected as the drivers’ variables in the process of multilayer perceptron neural network Markov chain model. The future land use/cover change (FLUCC) modeling results from 2030 to 2050 show that agriculture is the only land use type with a massive decreasing trend from 1985 to 2050 compared with other categories. The entire change in urban sprawl derived from historical and FLUCC in each period shows that urban construction land increases the fastest between 2020 and 2030. The rapid urbanization along with unplanned urban growth and rising population migration from rural to urban is the main driver of all transformation in land use.

We analyzed the spatial determinants of urban expansion, calibrated the land cover model using the Multi-Layer Perceptron Neural Network and Markov, and developed three scenarios to simulate land cover from 2017 to 2030 and to 2050. The scenarios include Business As Usual that extrapolates past trends; Regional Land Use Plan that restricts urban expansion to the land designated for urban development, and; Adjusted Urban Land that incorporates the leapfrogged settlements into the land designated for urban development. Additionally, we quantified the potential degradation of environmentally sensitive areas by future urban expansion under the three scenarios. Results indicated a high, little, and no potential degradation of environmentally sensitive areas by the future urban expansion under the Business As Usual, Adjusted Urban Land, and Regional Land Use Plan scenarios respectively. The methods and the baseline information provided, especially from the Adjusted Urban Land scenario showed the possibility of balancing the need for urban expansion and the protection of environmentally sensitive areas.

Thus, we propose the evaluation of novel methods for single tree crown detection, as most of these methods have not been investigated in remote sensing applications. A total of 21 methods were investigated, including anchor-based (one and two-stage) and anchor-free state-of-the-art deep-learning methods. We used two orthoimages divided into 220 non-overlapping patches of 512 × 512 pixels with a ground sample distance (GSD) of 10 cm. The orthoimages were manually annotated, and 3382 single tree crowns were identified as the ground-truth.

We observed that the two-stage anchor-based and anchor-free methods showed better performance for this task, emphasizing the FSAF, Double Heads, CARAFE, ATSS, and FoveaBox models. RetinaNet, which is currently commonly applied in remote sensing, did not show satisfactory performance, and Faster R-CNN had lower results than the best methods but with no statistically significant difference.

The study aims (1) to investigate the land-use/land-cover (LULC) changes over the past 27 years, and to simulate the future LULC dynamics over Gharbia; and (2) to produce an Urbanization Risk Map in order for the decision-makers to be informed of the districts with priority for sustainable planning. Time-series Landsat images were utilized to analyze the historical LULC change between 1991 and 2018, and to predict the LULC change by 2033 and 2048 based on a logistic regression–Markov chain model. The results show that there is a rapid urbanization trend corresponding to a diminution of the agricultural land. The agricultural sector represented 91.2% of the total land area in 1991, which was reduced to 83.7% in 2018. The built-up area exhibited a similar (but reversed) pattern. The results further reveal that the observed LULC dynamics will continue in a like manner in the future, confirming a remarkable urban sprawl over the agricultural land from 2018 to 2048. The cultivated land changes have a strong negative correlation with the built-up cover changes (the R2 were 0.73 in 1991–2003, and 0.99 in 2003–2018, respectively). Based on the Fuzzy TOPSIS technique, Mahalla Kubra and Tanta are the districts which were most susceptible to the undesirable environmental and socioeconomic impacts of the persistent urbanization. Such an unplanned loss of the fertile agricultural lands of the Nile Delta could negatively influence the production of premium agricultural crops for the local market and export. This study is substantial for the understanding of future trends of LULC changes, and for the proposal of alternative policies to reduce urban sprawl on fertile agricultural lands.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/rs13224498,"",,

To develop cost-effective agricultural solutions, 90% intensification of technological farming is required for achieving agricultural inputs and market demands. Today, the agricultural sector is affected by various factors like increased labor costs, increased population, crop failures, unpredictable yields, extreme weather, climate change, market fluctuations, etc. All these factors have directly or indirectly affected the socioeconomic status of farmers. With such a large number of challenges and increasing demands there is a need to implement an artificial intelligence-based approach for developing smart farming environment for the real-time monitoring and management of agricultural issues. According to a UN report, two-thirds of the world population will migrate to urban areas, resulting in a major decline in the agricultural workforce. This chapter proposes a smart farming environment based on artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain technology (BCT). Artificial Intelligence can be harnessed to automate and manage the agricultural and related tasks while blockchain technology can help in intensifying agri-food and supply chains. A sensational AI-based approach will help in developing the smart farming environment that can efficiently gather and monitor data for the real-time monitoring to address the uncertain issues faced by the agricultural community. BCT can handle issues related to the increased demands for agricultural products with transparency and trust. It will also accompany a variety of certifications schemes on branded agricultural products that face issues related to claims, labels and adulterations. BCT can prove to be an efficient solution for agricultural products’ safety, quality and sustainability. It will ensure the permanency of records during data sharing. The use of ICT in the agricultural sector will provide more efficient solutions for effective water and land usage resulting in maximum agricultural yields. This chapter proposes a neoteric smart and sustainable farming environment incorporating blockchain-based artificial intelligence approach.","",https://doi.org/10.1002/9781119621201.ch11,"",,

UFZ mapping, which identifies the UFZ categories in different spatial areas of a city, is of considerable significance to urban management, design, and sustainable development. Various deep learning-based (DL-based methods, which achieved remarkable results in an end-to-end supervised process, were proposed for UFZ mapping. However, the excellent performance of DL-based models relies heavily on a large number of well-annotated samples, which is impossible to obtain in practical UFZ mapping scenarios. Obtaining these well-annotated samples requires a lot of manual costs, which greatly limits the outcome of these methods in practical UFZ mapping tasks. In this paper, we proposed a UFZ mapping method using OpenStreetMap-based (OSM-based sample generation and the bi-branch neural network (BibNet . By adopting the idea of OSM-based sample generation, the proposed method utilized large-scale crowdsourcing labeled data (source domain in OSM to generate a UFZ dataset (target domain from OSM using remote sensing and social sensing data. Considering the inconsistent response of UFZ to various data observations, it is difficult to fully reflect the characteristics of UFZs using only remote sensing or social sensing data. We further proposed the BibNet, which utilizes two different deep neural network (DNN branches to comprehensively harness remote sensing images and social sensing data to map the UFZ.

Therefore, in order to protect the ecological environment, regulate urban development and pursue the maximization of ecological benefits, it is necessary to analyze, simulate and predict land use change. In this study, Hengyang City was taken as the study area, and based on the current land use data of Hengyang City in 2010, 2015, and 2018, the land use type transfer during 2010–2015 and 2015–2018 was analyzed. Then, starting from 2010, the FLUS model was used to simulate the spatial distribution of land use in 2015 and 2018, and then the spatial distribution of land use in Hengyang City in 2025 was predicted with the Markov prediction method under the premise of ecological protection priority. The results show that the change in ecological land in Hengyang City is mainly distributed in the surrounding and marginal areas, because the topography of Hengyang City is a basin. Changes in land type in Hengyang City in 2015 were subtle and difficult to observe. However, in 2018, the transformation of non-ecological land into ecological land was obvious, and the distribution area of ecological land expanded significantly. The Kappa index of the results simulated by the FLUS model based on neural network is above 0.72, and overall accuracy is above 0.9, which is highly consistent with the actual situation. It is reasonable and convincing to predict the spatial distribution of land use in the context of ecological protection. The predicted results can be useful for urban planning and land use distribution and provide a reference for relevant decision-makers.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/su131810458,"",,

The surface urban heat island (UHI) is the temperature in the lowest layers of the urban atmosphere; it is critical to the surface’s energy balance and makes it possible to determine internal climates that affect the livability of urban residents. Therefore, the surface UHI is recognized as one of the crucial global issues in the 21st century. This phenomenon affects sustainable urban planning, the health of urban residents, and the possibility of living in cities. In the context of sustainable landscapes and urban planning, more weight is given to exploring solutions for mitigating and adapting to the surface UHI effect, currently a hot topic in urban thermal environments. This study evaluated the relationship between land use/land cover (LULC) and land surface temperature (LST) formation in the temperate mountain valley city of Kathmandu, Nepal, because it is one of the megacities of South Asia, and the recent population increase has led to the rapid urbanization in the valley. Using Landsat images for 2000, 2013, and 2020, this study employed several approaches, including machine learning techniques, remote sensing (RS)-based parameter analysis, urban-rural gradient analysis, and spatial composition and pattern analysis to explore the surface UHI effect from the urban expansion and green space in the study area. The results revealed that Kathmandu’s surface UHI effect was remarkable. In 2000, the higher mean LST tended to be in the city’s core area, whereas the mean LST tended to move in the east, south, north, and west directions by 2020, which is compatible with urban expansion. Urban periphery expansion showed a continuous enlargement, and the urban core area showed a predominance of impervious surface (IS) on the basis of urban-rural gradient analysis. The city core had a lower density of green space (GS), while away from the city center, a higher density of GS predominated at the three time points, showing a lower surface UHI effect in the periphery compared to the city core area. This study reveals that landscape composition and pattern are significantly correlated with the mean LST in Kathmandu. Therefore, in discussing these findings in order to mitigate and adapt to prominent surface UHI effects, this study provides valuable information for sustainable urban planning and landscape design in mountain valley cities like Kathmandu.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/rs14164047,"",,

The 'Green Revolution' (GR) has substantial impact on the agricultural landscape and ESs in India. However, the effects of GR on ESs have not been adequately documented and analyzed. This leads to the main hypothesis of this work - 'the incremental trend of ESs in India is mainly prompted by GR led agricultural innovations that took place during 1960 - 1970'. The analysis was carried out through five successive steps. First, the spatiotemporal Ecosystem Service Values (ESVs) in Billion US$ for 1985, 1995, and 2005 were estimated using several value transfer approaches. Second, the sensitivity and elasticity of different ESs to land conversion were carried out using coefficient of sensitivity and coefficient of elasticity. Third, the Geographically Weighted Regression model was performed using five explanatory factors, i.e., total crop area, crop production, crop yield, net irrigated area, and cropping intensity, to explore the cumulative and individual effects of these driving factors on ESVs. Fourth, Multi-Layer Perceptron based Artificial Neural Network was employed to estimate the normalized importance of these explanatory factors. Fifth, simple and multiple linear regression modeling was done to assess the linear associations between the driving factors and the ESs. During the observation periods, cropland, forestland and water bodies contributed to 80%-90% of ESVs, followed by grassland, mangrove, wetland and urban built-up. In all three evaluation years, the highest estimated ESVs among the nine ES categories was provided by water regulation, followed by soil formation and soil-water retention, biodiversity maintenance, waste treatment, climate regulation, and greenhouse gas regulation. Among the five explanatory factors, total crop area, crop production, and net irrigated area showed strong positive associations with ESVs, while cropping intensity exhibited a negative association. Therefore, the study reveals a strong association between GR led agricultural expansion and ESVs in India. This study suggests that there should be an urgent need for formulation of rigorous ecosystem management strategies and policies to preserve ecological integrity and flow of uninterrupted ESs and to sustain human well-being.","",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2020.111381,"",,

The objective of this study is to create an urban quality of life index map for Al Ain city in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The research aligns with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals number ten (reduce inequalities) and eleven (sustainable cities and communities). In this study, remote sensing images and GIS vector datasets were used to extract biophysical and infrastructure facility indicators. The biophysical indicators are normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), normalized difference water index (NDWI), modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI), soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI), enhanced normalized difference impervious surfaces index (ENDISI), normalized difference built-up index (NDBI), land surface temperature (LST), slope, and land use land cover (LULC). In addition, infrastructure facility indicators such as distances to main roads, parks, schools, and hospitals were obtained. Additional infrastructure facility variables namely built-up to green area and build-up to bare soil area ratio were extracted from the LULC map. Machine learning was used to classify satellite images and generate LULC map. Random Forest (RF) was found as the best machine learning classifier for this study. The overall classification and Kappa hat accuracy was 95.3 and 0.92, respectively. Both biophysical and infrastructure facility indicators were integrated using principal component analysis (PCA). The PCA analysis identified four components that explain 75% of the variance among the indicators. The four factors were interpreted as the effect of LULC, infrastructure facility, ecological, and slope. Finally, the components were assigned weights based on the percentage of variance they explained and developed the UQoL map. Overall, the result showed that greenness has a greater effect on the spatial pattern of UQoL in Al Ain city.

Obtaining the urban land use type and analyzing the changes in their land use can lead to better management of the relationship between economic development and resource utilization. In this paper, a residual-intelligent module network was proposed to solve the problems of low classification accuracy and missing objects edge information in traditional computer classification methods. The classification of four Landsat-TM/OLI images from 1993–2020 for Jiaozuo city (the first batch of resource-exhausted cities in China) was realized by this method. The results (overall accuracy was 98.61%, in 2020 images) were better than the comparison models (support vector machine, 2D-convolutional neural network, hybrid convolution networks; overall accuracy was 87.12%, 96.16%, 98.46%, respectively) and effectively reduced the loss of information on the edge of the ground objects. On this basis, six main land use types were constructed by combining field surveys and other methods. The characteristics and driving forces of spatial-temporal change in land use were explored from the aspect of social, economic and policy factors. The results showed that from 1993 to 2020 the cultivated land, forest land, water body and other land types in the study area decreased by 690.97 km2, 57.54 km2, 47.04 km2 and 59.43 km2, respectively. The construction land and bare land increased by 839.38 km2 and 15.57 km2, respectively. The transfer of land use types was mainly from cultivated land to construction land, with a cumulative conversion of 920.95 km2 within 27 years. The driving forces of land use in the study area were analyzed by principal component analysis (PCA) and regression analysis. The spatial-temporal evolution of land use types was affected by policy changes, the level of social development and the adjustment in the economy, industry and agriculture structure. The investment in fixed assets and per capita net income in rural areas were the top two influencing factors and their cumulative contribution rate was 94.62%. The findings of this study can provide scientific reference and theoretical support for land use planning, land reclamation in mining areas, ecological protection and sustainable development in Jiaozuo and other resource-exhausted cities in the world.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/rs14092185,"",,

Remote sensing provides an effective method for real-time mapping and monitoring of urban green space changes in a large area. However, with the continuous improvement of the spatial resolution of remote sensing images, traditional classification methods cannot accurately obtain the spectral and spatial information of urban green spaces. Due to complex urban background and numerous shadows, there are mixed classifications for the extraction of cultivated land, grassland and other ground features, implying that limitations exist in traditional methods. At present, deep learning methods have shown great potential to tackle this challenge. In this research, we proposed a novel model called Concatenated Residual Attention UNet (CRAUNet), which combines the residual structure and channel attention mechanism, and applied it to the data source composed of GaoFen-1 remote sensing images in the Shenzhen City. Firstly, the improved residual structure is used to make it retain more feature information of the original image during the feature extraction process, then the Convolutional Block Channel Attention (CBCA) module is applied to enhance the extraction of deep convolution features by strengthening the effective green space features and suppressing invalid features through the interdependence of modeling channels.-Finally, the high-resolution feature map is restored through upsampling operation by the decoder. The experimental results show that compared with other methods, CRAUNet achieves the best performance. Especially, our method is less susceptible to the noise and preserves more complete segmented edge details. The pixel accuracy (PA) and mean intersection over union (MIoU) of our approach have reached 97.34% and 94.77%, which shows great applicability in regional large-scale mapping.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/f12111441,"",,

Assessments of the drivers of these changes have so far been focused on human activity on the subaerial delta plains. However, the fragile nature of deltaic ecosystems and the need for biodiversity conservation on a global scale require more accurate quantification of the footprint of anthropogenic activity across delta waterways. To address this need, we investigated the potential of deep learning and high spatiotemporal resolution satellite imagery to identify river vessels, using the Vietnamese Mekong Delta (VMD) as a focus area. We trained the Faster R-CNN Resnet101 model to detect two classes of objects: (i) vessels and (ii) clusters of vessels, and achieved high detection accuracies for both classes (f-score = 0.84-0.85). The model was subsequently applied to available PlanetScope imagery across 2018-2021; the resultant detections were used to generate monthly, seasonal and annual products mapping the riverine activity, termed here the Human Waterway Footprint (HWF), with which we showed how waterborne activity has increased in the VMD (from approx. 1650 active vessels in 2018 to 2070 in 2021 - a 25 % increase). Whilst HWF values correlated well with population density estimates (R2 = 0.59-0.61, p < 0.001), many riverine activity hotspots were located away from population centres and varied spatially across the investigated period, highlighting that more detailed information is needed to fully evaluate the extent, and type, of human footprint on waterways. High spatiotemporal resolution satellite imagery in combination with deep learning methods offers great promise for such monitoring, which can subsequently enable local and regional assessment of environmental impacts of anthropogenic activities on delta ecosystems around the globe.","",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.160363,"",,

These systems occur at fine scales, can be highly complex and therefore offer the opportunity to test mechanisms of ecological patterns and processes. The capacity to confidently characterize urban gardens and their land uses is still lacking, while it could provide the basis for assessing ecosystem service provision. Land classifications from remote sensing platforms are common at the landscape scale, but imagery often lacks the resolution required to map differences in land use of fine-scale systems such as urban gardens. Here, we present a workflow to model and map land use in urban gardens using imagery from an unoccupied aerial vehicle (UAV) and machine learning. Due to high resolutions (&amp;lt;5 cm) from image acquisition at low altitudes, UAV remote sensing is better suited to characterize urban land use. We mapped six common land uses in 10 urban community gardens, exhibiting distinct spatial arrangements. Our models had good predictive performance, reaching 80% overall prediction accuracy in independent validation and up to 95% when assessing model performance per cover class. Extracting spatial metrics from these land use classifications, we found that at the garden and plot scale, plant species richness can be estimated by the total area and patchiness of crops. Land use classifications like these can offer an accessible tool to assess complex urban habitats and justify the importance of urban agriculture as a service-providing system, contributing to the sustainability and livability of cities.","",https://doi.org/10.1093/jue/juac008,"",,

Updated information on urban land use allows city planners and decision makers to conduct large scale monitoring of urban areas for sustainable urban growth.

In this study, we explore a fully convolutional multitask network to classify urban land use from very high resolution (VHR) imagery. We experimented with three different setups of the fully convolutional network and compared it against a baseline random forest classifier. The first setup is a standard network only predicting the land use class of each pixel in the image. The second setup is a multitask network that concatenates the land use and land cover class labels in the same output layer of the network while the other setup accept as an input the land cover predictions, predicted by a subpart of the network, concatenated to the original input image patches.

Urban areas account for a small fraction of the Earth's surface but have a disproportionate impact on its surroundings regarding mass, energy, and resources. An exponential increase in the urban population has been observed since the mid-20th century. As expected by the United Nations (UN), by the year 2050, 68.4% of the world population will live in cities with a population of 20,000 or more. Due to enormous socio-economic pressures resulting from population expansion, urbanization and intensive changes in the landscape, an urban development program to make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable has become of the utmost importance since the 2005 World Summit in Rio and further adopted in 2015 by UN as the ""2030 Agenda"" for Sustainable Development. The study focused on monitoring the SDG 11 target 11.3.1. they are defined as a ratio of land consumption rate to the population growth rate because mapping urban land quickly and accurately is indispensable for watershed run-off prediction and other planning applications. There is no well-established, consistent way to measure either urban land sprawl or population growth. However, remote sensing methods and satellite-derived data make it possible to monitor urban growth rates over large areas in a relatively short time. There are many techniques for urban land cover automatically mapping. These techniques can be broadly grouped into two general types: those based on the input data classification, including pixel- and object-based classifications and those based on directly segmenting the indices, such as the commonly used normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), normalized build-up area index (NDBI), and their modifications.The authors used classical pixel (supervised classification with Spectral Angle Mapper classification and KNN methods) and objectbased classification in the presented research. In addition, spectral indices, i.e., NDVI, NDBI and their modifications to derive buildup areas, were applied. Moreover, the authors focused on the recent deep learning and machine learning methods, i.e., the utilization of spatial-context information in multi-temporal data to learn hierarchical feature representations. All methods of detecting built-up areas were compared and assessed based on the available cartographic data.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/isprs-archives-xliii-b3-2022-107-2022,"",,

The increase in the area of build-up land and unutilized land was detrimental to ecological quality, with the area of building land in the EDS being 1.75 times larger than in the year 2000. The EDS contributes to the sustainable development of the upstream area and the EPS is more conducive to the midstream and downstream areas by limiting the expansion of build-up land and by developing unutilized land in a limited way to increase the area of green space after reconciling economic conditions. Projection results promote the rational allocation of various land-use types in the future (semi) arid region, such as artificial forestation, unutilized land development and restriction of urban expansion, and also lay the foundation for the formulation of policies such as water allocation and ecological protection to facilitate the sustainable development of regional society, economy and ecology.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/su14052716,"",,

To adapt cities for modern faculties, regular monitoring of developing infrastructures is essential. The built-up land use map derived from remote sensing images shows how cities expand horizontally across the landscape as they grow over decades. Recent studies have shown that when planning for a more sustainable future in metropolitan settings, adding vertical components in the computation of built-up is beneficial for better understanding. As illustrated in this paper, the built-up area of an urban region is extracted from high-resolution LISS IV satellite sensor image data using deep learning techniques. The height of an urban built-up is estimated from Cartosat-1 stereo images using photogrammetric methods and automatic terrain extraction. This study combines the use of a deep learning model with the use of high-resolution remote sensing data to extract the urban built up volume. The results demonstrate that the western and northwestern areas of the study region see greater changes in urban volume compared to the central business district and other parts of the city. This work demonstrates a step-by-step strategy for studying urban growth patterns. It helps in understanding urban growth, population mobility patterns, societal typology, environmental indicators. The outcome of such study could be useful in the evaluation of various indicators of growth such as economic growth, traffic density conditions, utility planning, policy framework such as master plan preparation, and so on for governmental authorities.","",https://doi.org/10.1117/12.2597836,"",,

rayyan-220242000,Satellite Remote Sensing of Water Quality Variation in a Semi-Enclosed Bay (Yueqing Bay) under Strong Anthropogenic Impact,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"The semi-enclosed bays impacted by heavy anthropogenic activities have weak water exchange and purification capacities. Most of the sea bays have suffered severe eutrophication, water quality deterioration, ecosystem degradation and other problems. Although many countries and local governments have carried out corresponding environmental protection actions, the evaluation of their effectiveness still requires monitoring technology and data support for long-term water environment change. In this study, we take Yueqing Bay, the fourth largest bay in China, as a case to study the satellite-based water quality monitoring and variation analysis. We established a nutrient retrieval model for Yueqing Bay to produce a long-term series of nutrient concentration products in Yueqing Bay from 2013 to 2020, based on Landsat remote sensing images and long-term observation data, combined with support vector machine learning and water temperature and satellite spectra as input parameters, and then we analyzed its spatiotemporal variations and driving factors. In general, nutrient concentrations in the western part of the bay were higher than those in the eastern part. Levels of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) were lower in summer than in spring and winter, and reactive phosphate (PO4-P) levels were lower in summer and higher in autumn. In terms of natural factors, physical effects (e.g., seasonal variations in flow field) and biological effects (e.g., seasonal differences in the intensity of plankton photosynthesis) were the main causes of seasonal differences in nutrient concentration in Yueqing Bay. Nutrient concentration generally increased from 2013 to 2015 but decreased slightly after 2015. Over the past decade, the economy and industry of Yueqing Bay basin have developed rapidly. Wastewater resulting from anthropogenic production and consumption was transported via streams into Yueqing Bay, leading to the continuous increase in nutrient concentrations (the variation rates: aDIN&gt;0, aPO4−P&gt;0), which directly or indirectly caused high nutrient concentrations in some areas of the bay (e.g., Southwest Shoal at the mouth of Yueqing Bay). After 2015, the various ecological remediation policies adopted by cities around Yueqing Bay have mitigated, to some extent, the increasing nutrient concentration trends (the variation rates: aDIN&lt;0, aPO4−P&lt;0), but not significantly (P &gt; 0.1). The environmental restoration of Yueqing Bay also requires continuous and long-term ecological protection and restoration work to be effective. This research can provide a reference for ecological environment monitoring and remote sensing data application for similar semi-enclosed bays, and support the sustainable development of the bay.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/rs14030550,"",,

Although deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) have been widely utilized, they have rarely been used for land cover classification of complex landscapes. This study proposed the prior knowledge-based pretrained DCNNs (i.e., VGG and Xception) for fine land cover classifications of complex surface mining landscapes. ZiYuan-3 data collected over an area of Wuhan City, China, in 2012 and 2020 were used. The ZiYuan-3 imagery consisted of multispectral imagery with four bands and digital terrain model data. Based on prior knowledge, the inputs of true and false color images were initially used. Then, a combination of the first and second principal components of the four bands and the digital terrain model data (PD) was examined. In addition, the combination of red and near-infrared bands and digital terrain model data (43D) was evaluated (i.e., VGG-43D and Xcep-43D). The results indicate that: (1) the input of 43D performed better than the others; (2) VGG-43D achieved the best overall accuracy values; (3) although the use of PD did not produce the best models, it also provides a strategy for integrating DCNNs and multi-band and multimodal data. These findings are valuable for future applications of DCNNs to determine fine land cover classifications in complex landscapes.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/su141912563,"",,

Spatio-temporal changes and driving force analysis of wetlands in Jiaozhou Bay. Journal of Coastal Research, 38(2), 328–344. Coconut Creek (Florida), ISSN 0749-0208. Jiaozhou Bay is the largest bay-type coastal wetland with high biodiversity in Shandong Peninsula. In recent years, the wetland of Jiaozhou Bay has been reduced dramatically due to urban expansion. It is significant to study the characteristics and causes of the wetland changes in the past 40 years for the rational exploitation and sustainable development of coastal wetland resources. The types, spatial distribution, and area information of the wetland from 1983 to 2019 are obtained by artificial visual interpretation and supervised classification using ten Landsat remote sensing images, assisted by Google images. The research analyzes the conversion of land use types and the change rule of landscape pattern in the wetland, as well as the driving forces of the wetland evolution and the uncertainty factors affecting the analysis results. The results indicate that the wetland area shows an overall decreasing trend from 1983 to 2019, 77% of which are converted into nonwetland. The wetland area increases initially, followed by a decrease from 1990 to 2000, but then continues to decrease slowly from 2000 to 2019. There are many types of land use changes from coastal tidal flats to other land use types such as construction land or pond, and the landscape pattern has been gradually fragmented. The continuous increase in temperature is the main natural cause for the degradation of the wetland. Population factor is the most important driving force for the change of the wetland. The main uncertain factors affecting the analysis results are the capture time of remote sensing image, tidal level correction, wetland classification system, and method. The results provide a basis for the decision-making of wetland protection. The quantitative data will provide a reference for the construction of a multiyear wetland dataset in Jiaozhou Bay.","",https://doi.org/10.2112/jcoastres-d-21-00075.1,"",,
rayyan-220242150,"Study on the Evolution Law of Surface Landscape Pattern in Earthquake-Stricken Areas by Remote Sensing: A Case Study of Jiuzhaigou County, Sichuan Province",,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Earthquakes not only cause the destruction of surface buildings and a large number of casualties, but also have an important impact on regional land-use change. Timely understanding of land cover and its changes before and after earthquakes is of great scientific significance for studying the restoration and reconstruction of the natural ecosystem and the sustainable development of the social economy in disaster areas. At present, there are few studies on land cover changes before and after earthquakes in the earthquake-stricken areas, especially the quantitative assessment of land cover changes before and after earthquakes at the micro scale of landscape spatial distribution. Therefore, this article is based on remote sensing data and uses an earthquake in Jiuzhaigou, Sichuan, as an example. By calculating the land-use degree comprehensive index and its rate of change, the transfer matrix of land-use, quantitative expression methods of the landscape via the landscape pattern index are analyzed from the points of view of the spatial–temporal evolution law of the landscape pattern of land cover before and after the earthquake. The experimental results showed that the area of forest, cropland, shrub. and grassland types in the study area changed greatly, and the area of grassland types in Shuanghe Township changed most obviously, as they increased from 6.57 km2 in 2015 to 7.43 km2, and then decreased to 6.21 km2 in 2020. During the earthquake recovery period, the comprehensive index of land-use degree for most towns in the study area showed an upward trend, and the land cover types were improved. After 2017, the PD and LSI of the study area showed a downward trend, among which the bare land type changed greatly, with the PD value decreasing from 0.38 in 2017 to 0.21 in 2020, and the LSI value decreasing from 58.29 in 2017 to 40.69 in 2020. This indicates that the degree of landscape fragmentation and the spatial heterogeneity of the land surface in the study area are reduced in the later stage of earthquake recovery. After 2017, the AI value of the study area showed an upward trend, and the AI value of the bare land type increased from 63.97 in 2017 to 78.25 in 2020, indicating that the connectivity between landscape patches in the study area was enhanced in the later stage of the earthquake. This also reflects that the ecological environment of the study area gradually showed a good trend in the later stage of the earthquake. The results of this paper not only reveal the spatial–temporal evolution of land cover in Jiuzhaigou County before and after the earthquake, but also help the relevant national decision-making departments to formulate corresponding policies and measures.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/su142013032,"",,

rayyan-220242679,Advancing terrestrial biodiversity monitoring with satellite remote sensing in the context of the Kunming-Montreal global biodiversity framework,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract Satellite remote sensing (SRS) provides huge potential for tracking progress towards conservation targets and goals, but SRS products need to be tailored towards the requirements of ecological users and policymakers. In this viewpoint article, we propose to advance SRS products with a terrestrial biodiversity focus for tracking the goals and targets of the Kunming-Montreal global biodiversity framework (GBF). Of 371 GBF biodiversity indicators, we identified 58 unique indicators for tracking the state of terrestrial biodiversity, spanning 2 goals and 8 targets. Thirty-six shared enough information to analyse their underlying workflows and spatial information products. We used the concept of Essential Biodiversity Variables (EBV) to connect spatial information products to different dimensions of biodiversity (e.g. species populations, species traits, and ecosystem structure), and then counted EBV usage across GBF goals and targets. Combined with published scores on feasibility, accuracy, and immaturity of SRS products, we identified a priority list of terrestrial SRS products representing opportunities for scientific development in the next decade. From this list, we suggest two key directions for advancing SRS products and workflows in the GBF context using current instruments and technologies. First, existing terrestrial ecosystem distributions and live cover fraction SRS products (of above-ground biomass, ecosystem fragmentation, ecosystem structural variance, fraction of vegetation cover, plant area index profile, and land cover) need to be refined using a co-design approach to achieve harmonized ecosystem taxonomies, reference states and improved thematic detail. Second, new SRS products related to plant physiology and primary productivity (e.g. leaf area index, chlorophyll content &amp; flux, foliar N/P/K content, and carbon cycle) need to be developed to better estimate plant functional traits, especially with deep learning techniques, radiative transfer models and multi-sensor frameworks. Advancements along these two routes could greatly improve the tracking of GBF target 2 (‘improve connectivity of priority terrestrial ecosystems), target 3 (‘ensure management of protected areas’), target 6 (‘control the introduction and impact of invasive alien species’), target 8 (‘minimize impact of climate change on biodiversity’), target 10 (‘increase sustainable productivity of agricultural and forested ecosystems’) and target 12 (‘increase public urban green/blue spaces’). Such improvements can have secondary benefits for other EBVs, e.g. as predictor variables for modelling species distributions and population abundances (i.e. data that are required in several GBF indicators). We hope that our viewpoint stimulates the advancement of biodiversity monitoring from space and a stronger collaboration among ecologists, SRS scientists and policy experts.","",https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.04.25.489356,"",,

In this context, we evaluate historical and future associations between land use land cover changes and land surface temperature in Dera Ghazi Khan–one of the top cities in Pakistan–using multi-temporal Landsat data over two decades (2002–2022). After assessing current land use changes and future predictions, their impact on land surface temperature and urban heat island effect is measured using machine learning via Multi-Layer Perceptron-Markov Chain, Artificial Neural Network and Cellular Automata. Significant changes in land use land cover were observed in the last two decades. The built-up area expanded greatly (874 ha) while agriculture land (−687 ha) and barren land (−253 ha) show decreasing trend. The water bodies were found the lowest changes (57 ha) and vegetation cover got the largest proportion in all the years. This green-grey conversion in the last two decades (8.7%) and prospect along the main corridors show the gravity of unplanned urban growth at the cost of vegetation and agricultural land (−6.8%). The land surface temperature and urban heat island effect shows a strong positive correlation between urbanization and vegetation removal. The simulation results presented in this study confirm that by 2032, the city will face a 5° C high mean temperature based on historical patterns, which could potentially lead to more challenges associated with urban heat island if no appropriate measures are taken. It is expected that due to land cover changes by 2032, ~60% of urban and peri-urban areas will experience very hot to hot temperatures (&amp;gt; 31.5°C). Our results provide baseline information to urban managers and planners to understand the increasing trends of land surface temperature in response to land cover changes. The study is important for urban resource management, sustainable development policies, and actions to mitigate the heat island effect. It will further asset the broader audience to understand the impact of land use land cover changes on the land surface temperature and urban heat island effect in the light of historic pattern and machine learning approach.","",https://doi.org/10.3389/fevo.2023.1115074,"",,

The results revealed that the UTC cover of Brazilian cities is spatially heterogeneous, ranging from 5% to 34%. There was a difference in UTC coverage between the old and new urban areas, with the average largest difference near 5%. More than 76% urban population exposure to UTC coverage of 0∼0.2. Most cities have a relatively high inequality in human exposure to urban tree-covered spaces, especially in northeastern and southeastern Brazil. Results from the geographical detector models show climatic factors play a major role in determining the UTC cover patterns in Brazilian cities, followed by socioeconomic, geographical, soil, and urbanization factors. This study suggests the Brazilian government pay more attention to greening renovation projects in old urban areas and formulate effective urban tree irrigation policies for cities with limited autumn and winter rainfall. The study also suggests follow-up research on UTC cover patterns that consider the effects of race, urban history, city structure, land use, and local government policy factors to further support the goals of sustainable development in Brazilian cities.","",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scs.2023.105003,"",,

Decades of effort in land use mapping have accumulated a series of mapping approaches and land use products. New trends characterized by open big data and advanced artificial intelligence, especially deep learning, offer unprecedented opportunities for mapping land use patterns from regional to global scales. Combined with large amounts of geospatial big data, deep learning has the potential to promote land use mapping to higher levels of scale, accuracy, efficiency, and automation. Here, we comprehensively review the advances in deep learning based urban land use mapping research and practices from the aspects of data sources, classification units, and mapping approaches. More specifically, delving into different settings on deep learning-based land use mapping, we design eight experiments in Shenzhen, China to investigate their impacts on mapping performance in terms of data, sample, and model. For each investigated setting, we provide quantitative evaluations of the discussed approaches to inform more convincing comparisons. Based on the historical retrospection and experimental evaluation, we identify the prevailing limitations and challenges of urban land use classification and suggest prospective directions that could further facilitate the exploitation of deep learning techniques in urban land use mapping using remote sensing and other spatial data across various scales.","",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2024.114290,"",,

Acknowledged as rich in biodiversity and highly productive ecosystems, they provide ecosystem services represented in aspects such as air purification, urban climate regulation, physical and mental health, recreation, and contemplation, among a wide variety of other goods and services on which the quality of life of the inhabitants of large cities such as Bogota depends largely. We used cellular automata to model and simulate urban wetland changes in Bogota, Colombia. The study applied the coupled Markov-Future Land Use Simulation (FLUS) model to simulate and analyze land use/land cover (LULC) change over 20 years. First, we used an orthomosaic (1998) and two WorldView-2 satellite images (2004 and 2010), to detect land cover changes. Then, using the artificial neural network FLUS module, we calculated the relationships between land classes and associated drivers and estimated the probability of occurrence of each land class. Finally, we applied Intensity Analysis to examine the observed and projected LULC change (1998-2034). Results indicate that gains in areas of crops and pastures are at the expense of wetlands. In addition, simulation outputs show that wetlands will likely represent less than 2% of the total study area in 2034, representing a 14% decrease in 24 years. The importance of this project lies in its potential contribution to the decision-making process within the city and as an instrument of natural resource management.

The urge to monitor Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) and climate changes based on technology and sustainable management are addressed. This study analyzes the historical land cover maps to calculate growth patterns for the years 1985–2022 and uses Logistic Regression (LR) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to project future dynamics forecasts for the years 2030–2040 in the Amman-Zarqa Basin (AZB). The state of the climate and the extreme indices projections of CMIP5 under RCP8.5 are linked to the corrected historical LULC maps and assessed. Given greater dry covering of large surface runoff, little rainfall, and high evapotranspiration rates, the state of the climate across the AZB notably showed instability in key climatic indices and a major exacerbation of warmth and drier soil in the basin. Both climate change and land use are contributing dynamics, but land-use alterations are much more dramatic changes than climate changes. Since the effects of climate alterations are mostly identifiable through land cover forms, land use practices put the phase that may be influenced by climate change. The results revealed that the daily extremes in 1992 are aligned with the corresponding increase of barren lands and diminished the half area of forest, cultivated, rainfed, and pasture lands in 1995. Rainfed regions were converted to agriculture or shrubland with an accuracy of 0.87, and urban encroachment caused the acreage of woodland, cultivated, rainfed, and grazing fields to decrease by almost half. Predicted land cover maps were created using LR in 2030 (Kappa = 0.99) and 2040 (Kappa = 0.90), in contrast to the ANN approach (Kappa = 0.99 for 2030 and 0.90 for 2040). By combining ANN and LR, decreasing bare soil was anticipated between 325 km2 and 344 km2. As a result, 20% of the total area of the major AZB cities’ urban areas will be doubled. More subjective analysis is required to study and predict drought in the future to improve the resilience of various LULC types.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/su15032821,"",,
rayyan-220242967,Harnessing Machine Learning Algorithms to Model the Association between Land Use/Land Cover Change and Heatwave Dynamics for Enhanced Environmental Management,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"As we navigate the fast-paced era of urban expansion, the integration of machine learning (ML) and remote sensing (RS) has become a cornerstone in environmental management. This research, focusing on Silchar City, a non-attainment city under the National Clean Air Program (NCAP), leverages these advanced technologies to understand the urban microclimate and its implications on the health, resilience, and sustainability of the built environment. The rise in land surface temperature (LST) and changes in land use and land cover (LULC) have been identified as key contributors to thermal dynamics, particularly focusing on the development of urban heat islands (UHIs). The Urban Thermal Field Variance Index (UTFVI) can assess the influence of UHIs, which is considered a parameter for ecological quality assessment. This research examines the interlinkages among urban expansion, LST, and thermal dynamics in Silchar City due to a substantial rise in air temperature, poor air quality, and particulate matter PM2.5. Using Landsat satellite imagery, LULC maps were derived for 2000, 2010, and 2020 by applying a supervised classification approach. LST was calculated by converting thermal band spectral radiance into brightness temperature. We utilized Cellular Automata (CA) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to project potential scenarios up to the year 2040. Over the two-decade period from 2000 to 2020, we observed a 21% expansion in built-up areas, primarily at the expense of vegetation and agricultural lands. This land transformation contributed to increased LST, with over 10% of the area exceeding 25 °C in 2020 compared with just 1% in 2000. The CA model predicts built-up areas will grow by an additional 26% by 2040, causing LST to rise by 4 °C. The UTFVI analysis reveals declining thermal comfort, with the worst affected zone projected to expand by 7 km2. The increase in PM2.5 and aerosol optical depth over the past two decades further indicates deteriorating air quality. This study underscores the potential of ML and RS in environmental management, providing valuable insights into urban expansion, thermal dynamics, and air quality that can guide policy formulation for sustainable urban planning.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/land13081273,"",,

The primary objective of this research was to assess the changes in land use and cover and forecast future trends in Lagos for the sustainable development of urbanization. The study utilized remote sensing and GIS technologies to monitor and identify the land use and cover of Lagos from 2000 to 2020. The CA Markov artificial neural network technique for cellular automata was employed to predict changes in land use and cover from 2020 to 2030. In addition, the post-classification comparison method was used to detect changes in classified classes in land use and cover. The study classified satellite images for 2000, 2010, and 2020 to develop land use and cover maps using ERDAS Imagine. The classification was based on six categories, namely 1) water bodies, 2) built-up, 3) bare land, 4) forest, 5) vegetation, and 6) wetlands. The results showed that: 1) the vegetation cover, wetlands, built-up areas, forests, and bare land have undergone significant changes over the past two decades. Built-up areas, wetlands, and forests have increased by 33.57%, 1.01%, and 21.37%, respectively, while vegetation, bare land, and water have decreased by 21.77%, 5.14%, and 17.13%, respectively. 2) Moreover, during 2020-2030, it is projected that 19.18% of forests and 16% of vegetation will decline, while 5.27% of barren land, 0.82% of wetlands, and 15.83% of water will increase. The urban area will be expanded by 42.44%. 3) The simulated results showed that the correction percentage was 82.43%, and the global kappa value was 0.85. The study found that the expansion of urban built-up areas due to population growth was the primary driver of the changes in land use and cover in Lagos.

India moved from ship to mouth situation in the late 1960s to food self-sufficiency and has become Atmanirbhar and an exporter of food by producing 316.06 million tonnes in 2020-2021. However, rural India needs urgent attention as there is a great divide between the urban and rural family incomes, and the primary sector’s contribution to national GDP is hovering around 17-18% although the Indian economy is largely agrarian with 950 million rural population driving the economy. However, there is a large untapped potential in Indian agriculture to become the growth engine for the sustainable development of India as large yield gaps are existing. However, the challenges of growing water scarcity, increasing land degradation, growing population, urbanization, and most importantly impacts of climate change. Due to climate change with increasing temperatures, aridity is increasing in the country, and rainfall variability with a reduced number of rainy days and increasing intensity in different parts is a major concern. There is an urgent need to develop and adopt large-scale climate resilient management practices at a local level through empowering the small farm-holders with strengthened science of delivery using new science tools such as remote sensing (RS), global information system (GIS), internet of things (IoT), information technology (IT), artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), etc. Business as usual will not work and a new paradigm through building partnerships, enhancing collective action, market-led agro-eco region-based diversification and scaling-up through the empowerment of small farm-holders using new science tools is proposed.

To improve LULCC prediction, this study proposes the use of a random forest regression (RFR) model, in comparison with logistic regression–cellular automata (LR-CA) and artificial neural network–cellular automata (ANN-CA), for the prediction of LULCC (2019–2030) in the Gaborone dam catchment (Botswana). RFR is proposed as it is able to capture the existing and potential interactions between the LULC intensity and their nonlinear interactions with the change-driving factors. For LULCC forecasting, the driving factors comprised physiographic variables (elevation, slope and aspect) and proximity-neighborhood factors (distances to water bodies, roads and urban areas). In simulating the historical LULC (1986–2019) at 5-year time steps, RFR outperformed ANN-CA and LR-CA models with respective percentage accuracies of 84.9%, 62.1% and 60.7%. Using the RFR model, the predicted LULCCs were determined as vegetation (−8.9%), bare soil (+8.9%), built-up (+2.49%) and cropland (−2.8%), with water bodies exhibiting insignificant change. The correlation between land use (built-up areas) and water depicted an increasing population against decreasing dam water capacity.

Measuring and understanding urban land surface temperatures (LST) and their influencing factors is important in addressing global climate change and enhancing the well-being of residents. However, due to limitations in data precision and analytical methods, existing studies often overlook the microscale examination closely related to residents’ daily lives, and lack a deep exploration of the spatial heterogeneity of the influencing factors. This leads to these results being ineffective in guiding the planning and construction of cities. Taking Shenzhen as a case study, our study investigates the effects of various microscale build environment characteristics of LST using street view images and machine learning. A convolutional neural network model adopting the SegNet architecture is used to perform semantic segmentation on street view images, extracting features of the microscale urban-built environment. The LST is inverted through the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. By using Multiscale Geographically Weighted Regression (MGWR) models, our study reveals the comprehensive impact of the urban-built environment on LST and its significant spatial heterogeneity. The findings indicate that the proportions of sky, roads, and buildings are positively correlated with LST, while trees have a significant cooling effect. Although earth and water can reduce LST, their overall contribution is minimal due to limitations in their area and distribution patterns. This study not only reveals the key factors affecting urban LST at the microscale but also emphasizes the necessity of considering the spatial heterogeneity of these factors’ impacts. This suggests the need for targeted strategies for different areas to effectively improve the urban thermal environment and achieve sustainable urban development.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/atmos15050549,"",,

However, due to the noise and diversity of the data generated, only a small portion of the massive data collected from smart cities is used. In sustainable Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) management, environmental deterioration resulting from improper land usage in the digital ecosystem is a global issue that has garnered attention. The deep learning techniques of AI are recognized for their capacity to manage vast amounts of erroneous and unstructured data. In this paper, we propose a morphologically augmented fine-tuned DenseNet-121(MAFDN) LULC classification model to automate the categorization of high spatial resolution scene images for environmental conservation. This work includes an augmentation process (i.e. erosion, dilation, blurring, and contrast enhancement operations) to extract spatial patterns and enlarge the training size of the dataset. A few state-of-the-art techniques are incorporated for contrasting the efficacy of the proposed approach. This facilitates green resource management and personalized provision of services.","",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jksuci.2024.101921,"",,

Monitoring changes in LULC using geospatial techniques can help to identify areas at risk for indefensible land use, low-grade environment, and especially for sustainable urban planning. This study aims to analyze the changing pattern, dynamics, and alteration of LULC using Google Earth Engine (GEE) and Machine Learning Applications for the years 1991, 2001, 2011, and 2022 in the Varanasi City Development Region (VCDR). The LULC classification was divided into seven classes using random forest classification, and Landsat-5(TM) and 9(OLI-2) satellite data were used. Saga GIS has been utilized for the detection of LULC change during the 1991-2022 period. For validation of classification results, accuracy assessment was estimated using error matrices and through user, producer, and overall accuracy estimation. The Kappa statistics were applied for the reliability of the accuracy assessment result. As a result, the built-up area increased by 507.8 percent, and other classes like agricultural, barren, fallow land, and vegetation cover rapidly declined and altered into concrete areas over the period. Water bodies and river sand classes have been slightly converted into different classes. The finding explains that 114.8 km2 of fertile agricultural land, 14.81 km2 barren land, and 12.93 km2 of vegetation cover transformed into impervious surface, which is unsustainable and causes various problems like food scarcity, environmental degradation, and low quality of urban life. This study can be a useful guide for urban planners, academicians, and policymakers by providing a scientific background for sustainable urban planning and management of VCDR and other cities as well.","",https://doi.org/10.46488/nept.2024.v23i01.031,"",,

It is imperative to monitor and predict land subsidence over large areas. To address these issues, we chose Henan Province as the study area and applied small baseline subset-interferometric synthetic aperture radar (SBAS-InSAR) technology to obtain land deformation information for monitoring land subsidence from November 2019 to February 2022 with 364 multitrack Sentinel-1A satellite images. The current traditional time-series deep learning models suffer from the problems of (1) poor results in extracting a sequence of information that is too long and (2) the inability to extract the feature information between the influence factor and the land subsidence well. Therefore, a long short-term memory-temporal convolutional network (LSTM-TCN) deep learning model was proposed in order to predict land subsidence and explore the influence of environmental factors, such as the volumetric soil water layer and monthly precipitation, on land subsidence in this study. We used leveling data to verify the effectiveness of SBAS-InSAR in land subsidence monitoring. The results of SBAS-InSAR showed that the land subsidence in Henan Province was obvious and uneven in spatial distribution. The maximum subsidence velocity was −94.54 mm/a, and the uplift velocity was 41.23 mm/a during the monitoring period. Simultaneously, the land subsidence in the study area presented seasonal changes. The rate of land subsidence in spring and summer was greater than that in autumn and winter. The prediction accuracy of the LSTM-TCN model was significantly better than that of the individual LSTM and TCN models because it fully combined their advantages. In addition, the prediction accuracies, with the addition of environmental factors, were improved compared with those using only time-series subsidence information.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/rs15112843,"",,

Nighttime light (NTL) data can capture the lighting signal of ground objects. However, most built-up area extraction is conducted on public limited coarse spatial resolution NTL images. The Sustainable Development Science Satellite-1 (SDGSAT-1) provides 10 m spatial resolution panchromatic NTL images, making it possible to map detailed urban lighting structures. In urban extraction, the boundaries of urban areas are easily confused with background objects due to the similar spectral and textual features. To address this problem, we proposed a multi-task deep learning model, CG-CFPANet, to extract illuminated built-up areas by synthesizing SDGSAT-1 NTL data and optical remote sensing images. In CG-CFPANet, a convolutional feature pyramid attention (CFPA) module for better contextual recognition and a concatenation group (CG) module to merge the two remote sensing images are developed. Our proposed CG-CFPANet achieved 1.3% higher precision in built-up area extraction than ten other recently proposed network structures: UNet, UNet++, PSPNet, DeeplabV3, FCN, ExtremeC3Net, SegNet, BiseNet, Res2-UNet, and CBRNet.

Resistance to pests, diseases, and extreme weather events are among the most critical characteristics of resilient cities, closely related to species richness and, consequently, to the diversity of street trees. However, urban forest inventories are currently scarce worldwide. For this reason, urban trees' biodiversity and capacity to provide these ecosystem services are not developed enough. Three state-of-the-art species identification applications were tested, Plant.id, Pl@ntNet and Seek (iNaturalist) to identify a large number of tree families, genera, and species automatically. Two individual Google Street View images were queried for each tree in the study area, adjusting the Field of View and pitch parameters. The predictive capacity of the three apps was compared, and a biodiversity analysis was performed for different geospatial scales within the study area (i.e., at the whole study area, neighborhood, and street levels, respectively). Notably, our research contributes in an innovative way to the assessment and monitoring of the ecosystem services provided by street trees and sheds light on the great potential of combining remote sensing, citizen science and artificial intelligence for urban forest biodiversity assessments at multiple spatial and temporal scales.","",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jag.2024.103735,"",,

However, environmental concerns, such as air pollution from fossil fuels, are becoming limiting factors for energy sources. Therefore, the appropriate and sustainable solution is to transition towards renewable energy sources to meet global energy demands by using environmentally friendly sources, such as geothermal. The Harrat Rahat volcanic field, located in the western region of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), gets more attention due to its geothermal potential as a viable site for geothermal energy exploration due to its high enthalpy. The prime objective of this study is to present up-to-date and comprehensive information on the utilization of borehole temperature and remote sensing data to identify the most prospective zones with significant geothermal activity favorable for exploration and drilling. A brief description of the selected wells and the methodology used to determine the petrophysical parameters relevant to the geothermal potential assessment are presented. Special emphasis is given to gamma-ray ray and temperature logs for calculating heat production and the geothermal gradient. The effectiveness of various machine learning techniques are assessed throughout this study for predicting the temperature-at-depth to evaluate the suitability of employing machine learning models for temperature prediction, and it is found that XG Boost provided excellent results. It can be observed that some linear anomalies can be traced in the NW, trending on the west side of the Harrat volcanic field based on magnetic data interpretation. The land surface temperature in 2021 exhibited higher temperatures compared to 2000, suggesting potential volcanic activity in the subsurface.

Changes in ecosystem services brought on by changes in land use and cover (LULC) are a crucial early indicator and warning sign of ecological shifts. Using remote sensing and GIS tools, this study examined the shifting dynamics of ESVs in the Haridwar district in Uttarakhand state, India. The evaluation of land use land cover (LULC) changes was carried out by analyzing satellite images of the research region from 2001 to 2021. In addition, we examined changes in ecosystem services according to the study area’s LULC classifications. Using a random forest machine learning classifier, satellite images were classified into five categories of land cover: water bodies, forests, built-up areas, agricultural land, and bare land. The findings showed that from 2001 to 2021, forest cover and water bodies fell by 15.35% and 41.50%, respectively, while urban area and agricultural area rose by 69.24% and 12.31%, respectively. Due to increased urbanization and degradation of water bodies and forest areas, ESV fell from 103.19 USD ha −1 year −1 in 2001 to 70.53 USD ha −1 year −1 in 2021. The combination of LULC with the value of ecosystem services may improve our knowledge of several difficulties in an urban ecosystem. As a result, we advocate for the incorporation of LULC and ESVs as a tool that might be useful to urban planners and land managers in the future for sustainable development of natural resources.","",https://doi.org/10.1088/2631-8695/ad5c2c,"",,

Recently, image classification techniques using neural networks have received considerable attention in sustainable urban development, since their applications have an extreme effect on building distribution, infrastructural networks, and water resource management. In this research, a back-propagation shallow neural network model is presented for very high resolution satellite image classification in urban environments. Workflow procedures consider selecting and collecting data, preparing required study areas, extracting distinctive features, and applying the classification process. Visual interpretation is performed to identify observed land cover classes and detect distinctive features in the urban environment. Pre-processing techniques are implemented to present the used images in a more suited form for the classification techniques. A shallow neural network model (supported by MathWorks MATLAB environment) is successfully applied and results are evaluated. The proposed model is tested for classifying both WorldView-2 and WorldView-3 multispectral images with different spatial and spectral characteristics to check the model’s applicability to various kinds of satellite imagery and different study areas. Model outcomes are compared to two well-known classification methods; the Nearest Neighbour object-based method and the Maximum Likelihood pixel-based classifier, to validate and check the model stability. The overall accuracy achieved by the proposed model is 86.25% and 83.25%, while the nearest neighbour approach has obtained 84.50% and 82.75%, and the maximum likelihood classifier has accomplished 82.50% and 80.25% for study area 1 and study area 2 respectively. Obtained results indicate that the developed shallow neural network model achieves a promising accuracy for urban land cover classification in comparison with the standard techniques.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/isprs-annals-x-1-w1-2023-57-2023,"",,

The WHC works toward these goals by emphasizing the Outstanding Universal Value (OUV) of heritage sites and the unique contribution such places can make to conservation and human development agendas.1UNESCO, United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization. Operational Guidelines for the Implementation of the World Heritage Convention. Paris, France: UNESCO, 2021.Google Scholar As of the end of January 2023, the WHC has been signed by 194 state parties, covering 1,157 sites (including 900 cultural, 218 natural, and 39 mixed properties), 55 of which are considered to be in danger. These sites, totaling an area of more than 370 million hectares are designated as World Heritage (WH) sites (https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/). WH sites have played a significant role in the sustainable development of society globally and helped effectively maintain and preserve the cultural diversity and global biodiversity of the Earth.2Luo L. Wang X. Guo H. Contribution of UNESCO designated sites to the achievement of sustainable development goals.Innovation. 2022; 3100227Google Scholar However, WH sites around the world are experiencing significant impacts caused, in large part, by increasing anthropogenic threats (such as the rapid spread of urban sprawl, deforestation, resource overexploitation, air pollution, armed conflict, excessive tourism, and poor management).3Allan J.R. Venter O. Maxwell S. et al.Recent increases in human pressure and forest loss threaten many Natural World Heritage Sites.Biol. Conserv. 2017; 206: 47-55Crossref Scopus (104) Google Scholar There is also a range of overarching, long-term global challenges posed by climate change, extreme and severe weather events and geological hazards.4Vousdoukas M.I. Clarke J. Ranasinghe R. et al.African heritage sites threatened as sea-level rise accelerates.Nat. Clim. Chang. 2022; 12: 256-262Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar These threats, anthropogenic or otherwise, have put an unprecedented amount of pressure on the protection of both cultural and natural properties at the heritage sites. There is no conclusive solution to effectively protect heritage sties in the foreseeable future, and the public is becoming increasingly conscious about the negative impacts some anthropogenic activities have brought to heritage sites, exposing them to various risks for irreversible damage and loss. In light of this predicament, UNESCO, alongside its conservation partners, has been actively calling for the use of non-intrusive space technology (ST) to better evaluate and understand the detrimental factors surrounding WH sites and devise effective plans to mitigate negative impacts on OUV through the accurate identification, documentation, monitoring, and understanding of WH sites and their changes across large spatiotemporal scales. For this commentary, ST refers mainly to remote sensing (RS) based on Earth observation (EO) from space, as well as other geospatial information technologies such as geographic information systems (GIS) and global navigation satellite systems (GNSS). Even though ST was not developed intentionally for WH protection, it provides an advanced set of innovative and flexible tools that integrate scientific research into heritage science, which forms the evidential base to support measures for the protection of WH sites. ST also opens up paths of methodological innovation to facilitate future conservation of cultural and natural properties with new paradigms. On the basis of a half-century review of the applications of ST in the field of WH, we find that ST has effectively reshaped our means for WH conservation in four major domains of application: mapping, monitoring, modeling, and management of WH sites (Figure 1A). ST, as an objective and reliable ""eye"" from above for heritage experts, has enabled detailed mapping of heritages at various scales. This application commonly involves the acquisition and updatable analysis of multimodal datasets, combined with near real-time survey and investigation of WH sites and their contextual environments. ST is also an invaluable tool in identifying and designating potential new WH sites. The widespread integration of ST has played a crucial role in UNESCO's routine monitoring and emergency monitoring of cultural and natural heritages as a countermeasure to the challenges presented by global change. In particular, ST has made major contributions to fine-grained monitoring at very high resolutions in time and space and in assessing change caused by natural and/or anthropogenic processes. The combined application of RS, GIS, and augmented reality has facilitated the production of three-dimensional (3D) modeling of WH sites. In addition, photogrammetry and laser scanning can be used in WH surveys for generating 3D documentation of cultural and natural properties. Heritage information models of some popular WH sites have already been actively used in the fields of architecture study and digital ecology. The ability of ST to contribute to the conservation, planning, and management of WH sites has already been commonly used in the following domains: the definition of authenticity and integrity (AI), the mapping of OUV attributes of cultural and natural assets, the development and maintenance of heritage databases, 3D modeling and digital reconstruction, and informing WH management for sustainable development. The UNESCO WHC refers to its ""strategic objectives"" as the ""5 C's"": credibility, conservation, capacity building, communication, and communities.1UNESCO, United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization. Operational Guidelines for the Implementation of the World Heritage Convention. Paris, France: UNESCO, 2021.Google Scholar Here, we propose five key contributions (""5 D's"") of ST for conservation work involving WH sites (see Figure 1B): data, driver, discovery, digital transformation, and decision support. ST and the 5 D's, together with the WHC, constitute the ""turbine model"" for safeguarding WH that is proposed in this commentary and will assist in achieving the 5 C's over the next 50 years. By providing massive multi-source data, ST plays a crucial role in the WH governance chain. Archived data together with ongoing data acquisition record changes at WH sites and provide evidence for their conservation. The data collected through ST will, in turn, serve as an invaluable store of not only raw observations but also derivative products that can be extracted from imagery.5Levin N. Ali S. Crandall D. et al.World Heritage in danger: big data and remote sensing can help protect sites in conflict zones.Global Environ. Change. 2019; 55: 97-104Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar As a result of this data mechanism, ST will be able to mitigate the problem of lacunae in WH data by offering global coverage and consistency. ST is driving a revolution to become a new paradigm of WH protection. It provides advanced tools, such as RS data processing and GIS spatial analysis powered by machine learning, which can be used for dynamic monitoring and spatiotemporal analysis of changes that are occurring at WH sites. From this enhanced monitoring method, WH specialists and managers are empowered with the tools to monitor change over time and to assess whether conservation efforts to mitigate the impacts of natural and anthropogenic processes are contributing to positive outcomes toward sustainability. ST plays a key role in aiding frontier research across multiple disciplines related to heritage science. Scientific discoveries based on the use of new geospatial technologies and big EO data can be applied to the quantitative assessment of the state of WH protection. They can also be used to support deepened multidimensional interpretations of the OUV of WH sites, to guide the sustainable use of WH, and to improve accessibility so that all stakeholders may obtain unbiased and open information, thus increasing the credibility of WH as a global brand. ST provides a means of digital transformation that can be used for identifying, understanding, visualizing, presenting, and interpreting WH sites and their OUV in the digital space. In the future, ST will promote the transformation of WH protection through studies such as tangible heritage, digitalized heritage, or both. GIS-aided digital transformation will greatly improve the quality and efficiency of global communication and the dissemination of information related to WH sites, promoting public awareness of protection concepts and smoothing the implementation of actions. ST is becoming an invaluable tool to provide decision-making support along the entire chain of WH governance, from mapping to monitoring, modeling, and management. ST-based solutions could offer spatial intelligence to inform strategic decision making for multiple stakeholders, including local communities, WH sectors, institutions, and organizations. It offers an innovative path for capacity building and capacity enhancement in relation to the global governance of WH. These solutions are delivered in numerous ways, including databases, technologies, protocols, visualization platforms, and analytical systems. WH is under the influence of a wide array of anthropogenic and natural processes, giving the heritage bodies and national and international organizations promoting the preservation of WH sites an unprecedented opportunity to use science, technology, and innovation, including ST, to experiment innovative solutions and promote the role of WH in achieving sustainable development. Given that natural and anthropogenic challenges can present similar issues in various regions across the globe, it is evident that sharing knowledge and expertise, as well as developing collective strategies to leverage ST, while tailoring our methods to local circumstances, will be fundamental in developing a global approach for WH that is successful in the long run. The past 50 years of applications have resulted in continuous innovation in the development of ST to become powerful, cutting-edge tools for use in heritage documentation, monitoring, assessment and protection, and sustainable development. Although the progress is promising, we must underscore that relying solely on ST is insufficient; the greatest benefits are achieved by integrating ST with a variety of disciplines, such as management, economics, sustainability, sociology, education, ethics, politics, law, art, and aesthetics. Through closer and sustained engagement with a broader cross-section of society and local communities, ST can contribute to opening new horizons for WH protection over the course of the twenty-first century.

rayyan-220243515,Advancing terrestrial biodiversity monitoring with satellite remote sensing in the context of the Kunming-Montreal global biodiversity framework,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Satellite remote sensing (SRS) provides huge potential for tracking progress towards conservation targets and goals, but SRS products need to be tailored towards the requirements of ecological users and policymakers. In this viewpoint article, we propose to advance SRS products with a terrestrial biodiversity focus for tracking the goals and targets of the Kunming-Montreal global biodiversity framework (GBF). Of 371 GBF biodiversity indicators, we identified 58 unique indicators for tracking the state of terrestrial biodiversity, spanning 2 goals and 8 targets. Thirty-six shared enough information to analyse their underlying workflows and spatial information products. We used the concept of Essential Biodiversity Variables (EBV) to connect spatial information products to different dimensions of biodiversity (e.g. species populations, species traits, and ecosystem structure), and then counted EBV usage across GBF goals and targets. Combined with published scores on feasibility, accuracy, and immaturity of SRS products, we identified a priority list of terrestrial SRS products representing opportunities for scientific development in the next decade. From this list, we suggest two key directions for advancing SRS products and workflows in the GBF context using current instruments and technologies. First, existing terrestrial ecosystem distributions and live cover fraction SRS products (of above-ground biomass, ecosystem fragmentation, ecosystem structural variance, fraction of vegetation cover, plant area index profile, and land cover) need to be refined using a co-design approach to achieve harmonized ecosystem taxonomies, reference states and improved thematic detail. Second, new SRS products related to plant physiology and primary productivity (e.g. leaf area index, chlorophyll content & flux, foliar N/P/K content, and carbon cycle) need to be developed to better estimate plant functional traits, especially with deep learning techniques, radiative transfer models and multi-sensor frameworks. Advancements along these two routes could greatly improve the tracking of GBF target 2 ('improve connectivity of priority terrestrial ecosystems), target 3 ('ensure management of protected areas'), target 6 ('control the introduction and impact of invasive alien species'), target 8 ('minimize impact of climate change on biodiversity'), target 10 ('increase sustainable productivity of agricultural and forested ecosystems') and target 12 ('increase public urban green/blue spaces'). Such improvements can have secondary benefits for other EBVs, e.g. as predictor variables for modelling species distributions and population abundances (i.e. data that are required in several GBF indicators).

The term “land use” relates to how humans are using the landscape, whether it is for expansion, conservation, or a combination of the two. Human activity on the Earth’s surface alters the land cover area. These adjustments greatly affect how well-functioning vital Earth system components (such as the balance of energy, soil, and water). Applications for remote sensing make it possible to analyses land changes quickly and affordably. Numerous researchers have created techniques for analyzing modifications in the LULC. This study used GIS and random forest machine learning technique to pinpoint the LULC changes in Muzaffarpur District’s urban and rural areas in the span of 15 years i.e., 2005 to 2020. The User land is scattered throughout the western region. The district’s soil becomes more salinized and alkaline as a result of the waterlogging that is also prevalent in some areas of the district. This study’s technique is simple and inexpensive. Between 2005 and 2020, there were major variations in the LULC in the research area. The rise in built-up activity is the main cause of the LULC alterations in the studied region. The current study may not be significantly impacted by the LULC changes. However, to maintain environmentally sustainable development in the future, LULC alteration needs to be continuously watched.","",https://doi.org/10.60151/envec/rodf5502,"",,

  and Review",,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"The major Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) 2030, set by the United Nations Development Program (UNDP), include sustainable cities and communities, no poverty, and reduced inequalities. However, millions of people live in slums or informal settlements with poor living conditions in many major cities around the world, especially in less developed countries. To emancipate these settlements and their inhabitants through government intervention, accurate data about slum location and extent is required. While ground survey data is the most reliable, such surveys are costly and time-consuming. An alternative is remotely sensed data obtained from very high-resolution (VHR) imagery. With the advancement of new technology, remote sensing based mapping of slums has emerged as a prominent research area. The parallel rise of Artificial Intelligence, especially Deep Learning has added a new dimension to this field as it allows automated analysis of satellite imagery to identify complex spatial patterns associated with slums. This article offers a detailed review and meta-analysis of research on slum mapping using remote sensing imagery from 2014 to 2024, with a special focus on deep learning approaches. Our analysis reveals a trend towards increasingly complex neural network architectures, with advancements in data preprocessing and model training techniques significantly enhancing slum identification accuracy. We have attempted to identify key methodologies that are effective across diverse geographic contexts. While acknowledging the transformative impact Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in slum detection, our review underscores the absence of a universally optimal model, suggesting the need for context-specific adaptations. We also identify prevailing challenges in this field, such as data limitations and a lack of model explainability and suggest potential strategies for overcoming these.","",https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2406.08031,"",,

Using Landsat satellite datasets, this study investigated the complex interplay between urban Land Cover (LC) modification, fluctuation in Land Surface Temperature (LST) and severity of Urban Heat Island (UHI) from 1990 to 2020 in Peshawar city, Pakistan. Thermal bands were used to calculate LST and severity of UHI using Urban Thermal Field Variance Index (UTFVI). Furthermore, through Cellular Automata (CA), Logistic Regression (LR), and Artificial Neural Network (ANN), future predictions on thermal characteristics associated with land use changes were made. The results showed that the urban areas expanded by ~25% from 1990 to 2020, while ~10% decrease occurred in urban vegetation. The city will expand by ~45% and ~56% in 2035 and 2050, respectively. Notably, the results also demonstrated that urban hot spots were found the warmest with strongest UHI severity (34.02 oC), followed by the barren land (32.20 oC), and vegetation. The results further predicted an increase of LST (~55% and ~82%) and UTFVI (~62% and ~83%) in 2035 and 2050, respectively.

In the recent past, several factors such as rapid urbanization, soil degradation, and climate change have led to significant alterations in vegetation cover and composition, and have compromised Earth‘s natural ecosystem. Effective vegetation cover and composition management are quintessential to the sustainable growth of our planet. The field of vegetation cover and composition assessment is expanding as it realizes the essentiality of conserving biodiversity, effective land use planning, and optimum resource management strategies at our disposal. The recent advancements in deep learning and remote sensing technologies enable the collection of spatial information from the Earth‘s surface and the extraction of useful insights for informed decision-making that could benefit the environment. The aim of this research was to develop advanced semantic segmentation-based deep learning models using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that can effectively identify and differentiate multiple vegetation species, and accurately predict the area under vegetation cover. To achieve this target a dataset curation was done which comprised 10 diverse vegetation species especially âgrasses‘. The deep learning model of UNet was trained using different architecture backbones to generate composition assessment amongst different grass species. Also, trained predictive models were also used to evaluate the area under vegetation cover as well. The best-performing model was able to achieve an R<sup>2</sup> value of 0.84 in predicting the vegetation cover and a mean IOU score of 0.54 during testing. This study demonstrates a potential to use remote sensing data to generate vegetation cover and composition assessment for farming, urban planning, and construction applications.","",https://doi.org/10.13031/aim.202300237,"",,

In previous studies on UV detection, the semantic imbalance and feature interaction among cross-modal data have not been comprehensively considered, impacting the accuracy and interpretability of the results. In this work, a cross-modal fusion framework is proposed that integrates high-resolution remote sensing and street view images for UV detection. First, convolutional neural networks (ResNet-50) are used for feature extraction from both remote sensing and street view images. Then, an inner product channel attention module is used to dynamically adjust weights while considering multiangle views of street view images. A cross-modal feature fusion module that incorporates dilation convolution and a global-based feature fusion block is used to enhance feature interaction and fusion. The method has an overall accuracy (OA) of 0.975 for UV classification in a case study of the Guangzhou–Foshan metropolitan area in China, outperforming a set of baseline methods. The integration of remote sensing and street view images improves the OA value by approximately 2%. This work enhances the understanding of the distribution of UVs via both top-down and ground-level view data in an automatic and efficient way, providing urban planners with valuable insights to accurately identify UVs and support targeted, sustainable urban renewal aligned with the SDGs for inclusive, resilient cities.","",https://doi.org/10.1080/13658816.2024.2442096,"",,

However, in most developing countries, a spatiotemporal evaluation of urban growth is still lacking. Maseru, Lesotho’s capital and largest city, is growing rapidly due to various socioeconomic and demographic driving forces. However, urban expansion in developing countries has been characterized by entangled structures and trends exacerbating numerous negative consequences such as ecological degradation, the loss of green space, and pollution. Understanding the urban land use and land cover (LULC) dynamic is essential to mitigate such adverse impacts. This study focused on mapping and quantifying the urban extension in Maseru, using Landsat imagery from 1988 to 2019, based on the Support Vector Machines (SVM) classifier. We also simulated and predicted LULC changes for the year 2050 using the cellular automata model of an artificial neural network (ANN-CA). Our results showed a notable increase in the built-up area from 15.3% in 1988 to 48% in 2019 and bare soil from 12.3% to 35.3%, while decreased agricultural land (21.7 to 1.7%), grassland (43.3 to 10.5%) and forest vegetation (5.5 to 3.2%) were observed over the study period. The classified maps have high accuracy, between 88% and 95%. The ANN-CA projections for 2050 show that built-up areas will continue to increase with a decrease in agricultural fields, bare soil, grasslands, water bodies and woody vegetation.

Remote sensing has the potential to mitigate these effects by supporting sustainable development strategies with accurate information on urban growth. Deep learning-based methods have achieved promising urban change detection results from optical satellite image pairs using convolutional neural networks (ConvNets), transformers, and a multi-task learning setup. However, transformers have not been leveraged for urban change detection with multi-temporal data, i.e., >2 images, and multi-task learning methods lack integration approaches that combine change and segmentation outputs. To fill this research gap, we propose a continuous urban change detection method that identifies changes in each consecutive image pair of a satellite image time series. Specifically, we propose a temporal feature refinement (TFR) module that utilizes self-attention to improve ConvNet-based multi-temporal building representations. Furthermore, we propose a multi-task integration (MTI) module that utilizes Markov networks to find an optimal building map time series based on segmentation and dense change outputs. The proposed method effectively identifies urban changes based on high-resolution satellite image time series acquired by the PlanetScope constellation (F1 score 0.551) and Gaofen-2 (F1 score 0.440).

Satellite imageries and published Ecosystem Service Value (ESV) coefficient with benefits transfer method has been used to estimate ESV in response to Land Use and Land Cover Change (LULC). We used Artificial-neural-network-based cellular automaton (ANN-CA) model to simulate LULC in 2030 and 2050 based on LULC data from 1990 to 2020. Predicted results reveal that agricultural land, barren land, vegetation, and water bodies are likely to decline by 7.56%, 3.06%, 12.22%, and 1.77%, respectively, between 2020 and 2050, but built-up areas are expected to increase by 24.61% owing to urbanization, industrialization, and economic growth. ESV results indicate that vegetation and agriculture make up 70% of the overall ESV, making them the leading LULC groups. The overall ESV could fall by 8.95 US$ ×106/year, mostly due to a decline in agricultural land, waterbodies, and vegetation. This study also identified the contribution of individual Ecosystem Services (ES) functions to the overall ESV. In 2020 and 2050, the ratio of provisioning, regulating, and supporting services to overall ESV is expected to decline from 19.95–8.77%, 39.60–25.60%, and 28.80–13.63%, respectively. On the contrary, the proportion of cultural services to total ESV will rise from 11.66% in 2020 to 52% in 2050, illustrating the rising importance of non-material ecological benefits like as recreation and tourism.

Accurate and continuous estimation across large spatial regions is crucial for the implementation of LST as an essential parameter in climate change mitigation strategies. Here, we propose a deep-learning-based methodology for LST estimation using multi-source data, including Sentinel-2 imagery, land cover, and meteorological data.

However, it should be noted that vertical growth caused by urban renewal has been disregarded, while the horizontal expansion of urban areas has been widely studied. Understanding dynamic land cover change and its impact focusing on the thermal environment is essential for the sustainable management of urban areas. Therefore, the objective of this study is to propose a simple yet effective urban thermal environment investigation strategy that responds to dynamic land cover transformation. The study area is Suwon, Republic of Korea, where the city has recently been experiencing the most extreme urbanization along with explosive population growth. We designed a three-step approach: 1) extraction of temporal local climate zone (LCZ) to monitor the change in land cover due to urban growth over the period 2004 and 2021, 2) retrieval of high spatial-resolution land surface temperature (LST) using artificial intelligence to observe surface energy flux in heterogeneous urban area in detail, and 3) apply the filtering analysis method, which only uses the pixels classified with a higher confidence level, based on deep learning probabilistic approach to reduce the uncertainty of LCZ classification. To construct the temporal LCZ maps with a 30 m spatial resolution and retrieve the downscaled LSTs (DLSTs) with a corresponding spatial resolution, Landsat series satellites, Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM), and land cover map produced by Ministry of Environment were used. We obtained the following results: First, the overall accuracy (OA) of the LCZ classification was higher than 90% in both 2004 and 2021. Second, the average coefficient of determination (R2) and root mean square error (RMSE) of the DLSTs were greater than 0.9 and less than 1 &amp;#176;C, respectively.

In this study, we develop a new method for fine-grained and accurate flood detection by integrating multitemporal Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar images, OpenStreetMap data, and convolutional neural networks. We take the 2017 Houston flood event as a test case, where the study areas are divided into six fine-grained LULC classes, i.e., residential areas, service areas, main roads, forest, grassland, and waterways. Based on the information of fine-grained LULC classification, the proposed method performs more prominently than the baseline methods for urban flood detection. Specifically, compared with such baseline methods, F1 score, overall accuracy, and Kappa increase by more than 3.96%, 4.53%, and 9.26%, respectively. The integration of remote sensing and crowdsourced data provides a new perspective for flood detection in complex urban environments, thus supporting emergency management.","",https://doi.org/10.1109/jstars.2024.3433010,"",,

An integrated Cellular Automata-Artificial Neural Network (CA-ANN) methodology which is provided by the Molusce Plugin model in QGis was employed to produce Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) maps for the years 2020, 2040, 2060, and 2100. The results of the validation K (overal)= 0.83499, K(location)= 0.8586, K(histo) = 0.97245, % of correctness =93.044 and R²= 0.9997 demonstrated a high level of concordance between the classed maps and the maps generated by the model. Future predictions demonstrate that the built-up land will increase (from 2481.95 to 16347.77 km²), barren land, water bodies, (Dense, Sparse) vegetation, Plantation, and Agricultural fallow and Agricultural land will decrease (from 22595.4 to 19129.18 km²), (from 672.1 to 562.29 km²), (from 1059.83 to 425.73 km²), (from 962.50 to 320.20 km²), (from 1196.75 to 428.5 km²), (from 15172.0389 to 10644.1551 km²) and (from15877.071 to 12408.32 km²) respectively. The decrease in the future agricultural land will impact the water and food security of this zone. These forecasts can assist in recognizing probable ecological consequences, such as alterations in water availability, agricultural stability, and the depletion of natural habitats.

Convolutional neural networks were employed in conjunction with satellite imagery analysis to map and quantify the changes in land use and cover. This revealed significant trends and transformations within the peninsula’s landscape. The analysis revealed a notable increase in urban expansion, particularly at the expense of natural ecosystems. Furthermore, there was a notable reversion of agricultural lands to grasslands, driven by economic downturns and reduced agricultural activity. These land cover changes underscore the urgency of implementing sustainable land management policies. The study recommends the establishment of conservation easements to protect remaining natural ecosystems, the initiation of reforestation programs to restore degraded lands, and the development of comprehensive water management strategies to address the peninsula’s hydrological challenges. Furthermore, the study underscores the pivotal importance of integrating change analysis and predictive modeling to anticipate future land cover scenarios and inform effective land management strategies. The model developed through this research, which employs advanced remote sensing and GIS technologies, provides a robust framework for understanding and managing land use and land cover change. This model can serve as a reference for similar regions globally, offering insights that can inform sustainable land use practices and policy decisions. The findings of this study have implications that extend beyond the Kerch Peninsula.

rayyan-220244008,Building Height Estimation at 10m across multiple countries using Sentinel Time-Series,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"With the rapid shift of urban population to cities, urbanization monitoring has become essential to ensure sustainable development. In the last decade, 2D urban monitoring such as building footprint extraction has received considerable attention resulting in multiple high and low-resolution products. But despite being the essential component of urbanization, the vertical dimension (height) has not been studied at a large scale. Accurate estimation of building height plays an important role in urban planning, as it is correlated with energy consumption, population, transportation, city planning, urban climate and many other monitoring and planning required for sustainable development. Airborne LiDAR or high-resolution orthophotos can be used for accurate building height estimation but for large-scale monitoring applications, the data collection itself is extremely expensive. With a compromise of resolution, Earth observation data, especially free-of-cost data can be used for large-scale monitoring. Existing large-scale building height estimation methods operate at low resolution (1km to 100m). A few of the recent studies improved the resolution to 10m while operating in a few cities to few states of the country. In this study, we estimate building heights across four countries. We propose a DL model that operates on a time series of Sentinel-1 SAR and Sentinel-2 MSI data and estimates building height at 10m spatial resolution. Our model estimates building height with 1.89m RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) surpassing the best score of 3.73m reported in previous studies.&amp;#160; To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we tested it on data from four countries and compared it with a baseline and four recent DL networks. We evaluate the impact of time series input and individual input modality i.e., SAR and optical data on the performance of the proposed model. The model is also tested for generalizability. Furthermore, the predicted building heights are downsampled and compared with GHSL-Built-H R2023A, a state-of-the-art product at 100m spatial resolution. The results show an improvement of 0.3m RMSE.

Monitoring these changes for sustainable urban development, resource management, and disaster readiness is imperative. Satellite image Change Detection (CD) has emerged as a potent tool for comprehensively and efficiently evaluating urban changes over time. Techniques for CD facilitate identifying, characterising, and quantifying modifications in land cover, land use, and natural phenomena. This capability is pivotal for environmental monitoring, resource management, and disaster response. Detecting changes in urban expansion, deforestation, agricultural practices, and natural disasters contributes to informed decision-making and sustainable development. Whether it is gradual urban expansion or sudden infrastructural developments, the ability to detect changes offers valuable insights into the patterns and drivers of urban growth. Integrating remote sensing technologies and advanced image processing techniques has remarkably enhanced the accuracy and efficiency of CD in urban environments. These methods enable the identification of land cover changes, such as converting green spaces to built-up areas or adjusting transportation networks. This paper introduces an effective CD model that incorporates a deep learning approach. The proposed architecture is directly inspired by the U-Net model, adapted into the AC-PF while considering the available training data.

The landscapes and environment around urban waters have always been the main focus of maintaining water quality for sustainable water supplies. Early-stage field investigations recognized the influence of land use/land cover (LULC) on water quality. To extend the research scope in spatial and temporal dimensions, remote sensing techniques have been utilized to discover the relationships between LULC and water quality. However, these remote sensing datasets generally had a medium spatial resolution, making them unable to support the fine-detailed land classifications that are critical to explore the water quality in an urban area. Moreover, although more details regarding the land surface are available from the currently-generated high-resolution and very-high-resolution remote sensing images, this land surface information is too complex for the state-of-the-art deep learning approaches and benchmark datasets. This manuscript reports our efforts on developing a framework to explore the fine-resolution relationship between surface water pollution and LULC. To address the cost of computing time and limitations of well-labelled datasets, we employ a foundation model-enhanced approach for water extraction and water-surrounded LULC classification. We propose an estimator of surface water pollution susceptibility to main pollutants based on the surrounding LULCs. Selecting the Future City of Beijing as the study area, based on very-high-resolution remote sensing images, the experiment proved that our proposed approach could effectively map the susceptibility of surface water pollution caused by its surrounding land use and land cover. To our knowledge, the relationship of LULCs and water quality have not been investigated using 0.5 m spatial resolution data. We hope our work can provide a prospective fine-detailed water quality analysis in the community of water environment of remote sensing.","",https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/ad4a92,"",,

Yet the differences in land productivity degradation under various land management patterns (land sparing vs. land sharing) are poorly known. In this research, we used remote sensing data to develop a machine learning model for assessing the risk of land productivity degradation and interpreted the model using state‐of‐the‐art interpretable artificial intelligence techniques. In 2018, the risk level of land productivity degradation in the agricultural production space of the Yangtze River Delta urban agglomeration (YRD) was 0.230. More than half of the area was at low risk (68.19% of the area), mainly in mountainous and hilly areas. The degradation risk of the land sharing management pattern is lower than that of the land sparing pattern, but there are significant differences among provinces/municipalities. The four most influential factors for land productivity degradation in YRD were Normalized Vegetation Difference Index, nighttime light, elevation, and nitrogen deposition, which together explained 72.75% of the degradation risk. This study provides a methodological framework for land degradation governance in emerging urban agglomerations. It strongly recommends that policymakers explore locally appropriate land management patterns based on regional contexts.","",https://doi.org/10.1002/ldr.5219,"",,

In Meherpur District, Bangladesh, limited research has integrated LULC mapping with predictive models, resulting in a gap in knowledge regarding future land use patterns in this fast-changing region. This study addresses that gap by analyzing LULC changes from 2000 to 2024 using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Geographic Information Systems (GIS), and the Cellular Automata (CA) model for predictive analysis. The study reveals significant LULC changes over the 24-year period, including an 18% decrease in vegetation cover, a 6% reduction in agricultural land, and a 4% increase in built-up areas. These trends align with global patterns of urban expansion, often at the expense of agricultural and natural land. Additionally, increases in fallow land (7%) and water bodies (8%) indicate changing land use driven by population growth and infrastructure development. The loss of vegetation, in particular, poses risks to biodiversity, climate regulation, and food security. An innovative aspect of this research is the use of the CA model with the MOLUSCE plugin in QGIS, enabling simulations of future LULC changes up to 2032. This predictive approach offers insights into the impacts of ongoing urbanization, unlike previous studies in Bangladesh that mainly focused on historical LULC changes. The study suggests several future research directions, including investigating the socio-economic drivers of LULC changes, expanding the geographic scope to neighboring regions, and incorporating advanced remote sensing and machine learning techniques to enhance the accuracy of predictions. In conclusion, this research fills a critical gap in LULC studies in Meherpur by combining historical analysis with predictive modeling, offering valuable insights for policymakers to guide sustainable land use planning amidst ongoing urbanization and agricultural development.","",https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-5275701/v1,"",,

This study relied on remote sensing data to analyze and assess land use and land cover changes in Babil Province, Iraq, over the past two decades. The study focused on identifying the patterns and factors influencing these changes, using Landsat satellite imagery to create digital maps classifying land into four main categories: urban lands, bare soil lands, water bodies, and vegetation lands.

rayyan-220244156,Estimation of Potential Impact of Land Use Change on Sediment Yield From a Small Tropical Watershed Using the <scp>TREX</scp> Erosion Model,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"ABSTRACT Analysis of the influence of changes in land use on the sediment yield from watersheds provides crucial inputs that aid the development of appropriate strategies for the sustainable management of consequent land degradation. Event‐based hydrologic models can be used for performing such analysis, as long‐term hydrological datasets are not available for most of the rivers in developing countries like India. In this study, an event‐based Two‐Dimensional Runoff, Erosion, and Export (TREX) model was used to simulate the soil erosion process in Moozhy, an ungauged watershed in the Karamana River basin in Thiruvananthapuram District, Kerala State, India. Rainfall, streamflow, and sediment concentration data corresponding to three isolated storm events were used to calibrate and validate the model. The performance of the model was assessed using four statistical measures, namely, Percent bias (PBIAS), Nash‐Sutcliffe Efficiency Coefficient (NSEC), Coefficient of determination ( R 2 ) and RMSE‐observations standard deviation ratio (RSR). The values of PBIAS varied between 46% and 49%, indicating satisfactory performance of the model. Also, from the values of NSEC and RSR, it can be concluded that the TREX model yields acceptable results. For a rainfall event that occurred on the 17 September 2017, the simulated values showed that about 1054 t of suspended sediments are transported from the watershed to the stream channels, and about 1020 t is carried out of the Moozhy watershed. Only a very small amount of sediment is left in the channel at the end of the simulation. About 34 t of sediment is deposited in the channel bed, about 0.04 t remains in suspension, and the balance 0.04 t remains in suspension as a suspended load. About 3% of the total sediment entering the reach of the stream considered in this study is deposited on the riverbed. The major component of the settled sediments is silt; about 12% of the total silt size fraction entering the stream settles on the river bed. Future scenarios of land use in the watershed were modelled using a hybrid Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Cellular Automata (CA) model. These were used for simulating sediment discharge using the TREX erosion model. The predicted land use scenarios were used to investigate both short‐term (2025 and 2029) and long‐term (2037, 2045, and 2053) variations in sediment discharge. The sediment yield for the storm event that occurred on 17 September 2017 was used to benchmark the variation in sediment yield under the predicted land use scenarios. Results indicate that the peak runoff and the runoff volume are expected to increase by about 29% and 22% respectively in the period from 2005 to 2053. The expected increase in the volume of sediments in this period is about 50%; the peak sediment concentration is likely to increase by about 56%. The study highlights the threats of likely increase in soil erosion and consequent land degradation posed by unscientific changes in land use caused by urbanisation and calls for proper management interventions to address the problem.","",https://doi.org/10.1002/ldr.5398,"",,

This study focuses on monitoring, predicting and understanding land cover changes in the basin from 1987 to 2018, with projections up to 2030. It explores the intricate relationship between population growth and land cover dynamics, aiming to contribute to sustainable land management practices and align with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for 2030. Using a combination of neural network classification and the CA-Markov model, the study analyses historical land cover data to identify significant transformations. Between 1987 and 2018, bare lands increased by 29%, vegetation increased by 14%, built-up areas increased by 128% and waterbodies increased by 10%, whereas there was a 58% decline in the extent of wetlands. The most significant transformation occurred in the wetlands, with a total of 1819.46 km2 being converted to various land cover types. The results demonstrate remarkable shifts characterised by rapid urbanisation, substantial wetland loss and a decline in vegetation cover. Expectedly, population growth is found to be closely linked to the expansion of built-up areas while negatively impacting other land cover types. These findings underscore the urgent need for sustainable land management strategies that balance the demands of growing populations with the preservation of natural ecosystems and biodiversity. Furthermore, the study provides future projections that offer crucial insights for decision-makers involved in land use planning, biodiversity conservation and sustainable development.","",https://doi.org/10.14746/quageo-2024-0011,"",,

An extensive overview of the development potential for both present and future is provided through an investigation of spatially shifting behaviors of LULC and modeling of prospective eventualities. With a 20-year approximation from 2000 to 2020, we used substantial multi-temporal data collected via satellite to explore opportunities for evolution from one spatiotemporal transition state to a subsequent and prospective LULC model. In the MOLUSCE plugin of Q-GIS, uncorrelated parameters (DEM, gradient, and location concerning roadways) have been combined with an incorporated CA-ANN technique. Throughout previous three decades, impervious surface area increased from 12.48% to 28.91%, while water levels increased from 1.43% to 1.39%, demonstrating that physical and social driving forces had significant influence on landscape pattern. Urbanization and development are reflected from rising water table and shrinking impermeable surface. Land use shifts or climatic variability may result decline in water levels, whereas the rise in impermeable surfaces points in the direction of proliferation of metropolitan region. The quantity of dry land decreased from 48.28% to 43.11%, the verdant area was 27.34% to 13.77%, and woodland shrank from 22.70% to 12.64%. The estimates from 2030 to 2040 further endorse an increasing shift toward impermeable terrain at the expense of substantial forests and natural habitats. For successful land management, urban planning, and sustainable development, LULC trends must be precisely predicted. In-depth reviews and analyses of predictive modeling approaches utilized for LULC prediction are provided in the study. This study investigates frequently used data sources and preprocessing methods, looks at difficulties with LULC prediction, and offers critical assessment of modeling strategies.

Since the proposal of the ""2030 Agenda"", the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal indicator 11.7.1 aims to calculate the accessibility and quality of urban open spaces(UOS). An accurate and rapid assessment framework of UOS is of great significance for urban sustainable development. Previous research on UOS has mainly focused on the evolution patterns of UOS, with little research on assessments of their accessibility for different population structures (i.e., men vs. women, young vs. older). In this study, a U-Net deep learning network was used for training from 3072 annotated samples of urban green spaces(UGS) which was created based on Gaofen-2 remote sensing images. The trained model was used to identify UGS within five districts of Beijing at sub-meter level, incorporated with Open Street Map and area of interest data. A spatial analysis was conducted for accessibility of UOS, finding that most of the UOS in the central urban area of Beijing can be reached within 10 minutes, but access to the eastern and western edges is poorer (more than 30 minutes). Finally, using Worldpop data, the accessibility of UOS was statistically analyzed for different ages and genders. The results show that UOS accessibility rate for the elderly and children reaches over 90% (10 minutes accessibility).","",https://doi.org/10.5194/isprs-annals-x-1-w1-2023-387-2023,"",,

Satellite-derived land surface temperature (LST) data at high spatial resolution can indicate comparatively warm and cold places within cities. This offers the opportunity to analyze the cooling effect of vegetation cover, and to separate it from other drivers. Further, it is possible to compare the cooling effects of different urban vegetation such as meadows and trees.&amp;#160; Here, we use daily high-resolution LST data jointly with land cover information from &gt;100 cities worldwide during their warmest three months in 2013. We train random forest models to predict LST patterns from land cover information for each day and city. As a first result we find that random forest models generally outperform linear regression models in predicting LST, and are therefore better suited to study the relative roles of individual drivers. Then, we estimate the influence of tree cover and short vegetation cover on LST by calculating SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values. We find that trees contribute to decreasing urban LST in most cities and days while only half samples indicate decrease of LST caused by short vegetation. Thereby trees have a much larger cooling effect than short vegetation. This is probably related to sustained transpiration during warm and dry conditions thanks to deep rooting systems, which is typically not the case for short vegetation. Also for trees, the cooling effect varies across climate regimes, with the largest effects in cities with temperate climate.&amp;#160; Moreover, we find that the cooling effect of trees is particularly large during the hottest days while it is limited by high relative humidity. This probably reflects the impacts of radiation and vapor pressure deficit on tree transpiration. Overall, our analysis demonstrates how remote sensing data and machine learning methods can inform urban vegetation cooling to deal with more frequent hot extremes.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu24-11630,"",,

Using satellite imagery for real-time examination in Kuantan has become exceedingly expensive due to the scarcity and obsolescence of real-time LULC data.

A quantitative assessment of image classification schemes (supervised classification using maximum likelihood and deep learning classification using random forest) was examined using 2022 Sentinel-2 satellite imagery to measure its performance. Kappa coefficient and overall accuracy were used to determine the classification accuracy. Then, 32 years of LULC changes in Kuantan were investigated using Landsat 5 TM, Landsat 8 OLI, and Sentinel-2 based on the best classifier. Random forest classification outperformed maximum likelihood classification with an overall accuracy of 85% compared to 92.8%. The findings also revealed that urbanisation is the main factor contributing to land changes in Kuantan, with a 32% increase in the build-up region and 32% in forest degradation. Despite the subtle and extremely dynamic connection between ecosystems, resources, and settlement, these LULC changes can be depicted using satellite imagery. With the precision of using a suitable classification scheme based on comprehensive, accurate and precise LULC maps can be generated, capturing the essence of spatial dynamics, especially in under-monitored basins.

According to the analysis results, the regulations for our study areas were set lower than those for other water management zones, resulting in a high rate of urbanization. Therefore, the climate resilience project in the water management area should be implemented first, despite the need for a long-term view in adapting to climate change.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/su16208805,"",,

This is why LULC Change Analysis plays an important role in planning and using current and future natural resources for the sustainable development of any country. This paper performs LULC classification and analysis over a study region in Ganjam District, Odisha, India. Satellite data was extracted from Landsat 7 and 8 satellites that provide spectral and multi-temporal images. For the LULC classification, 5 LULC classes were considered such as water bodies, vegetation, urban areas, barren Land, and cropland. A machine learning-based approach was applied using Google Earth Engine (GEE) to compare different supervised classifiers such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Classification and Regression Trees (CART), and Random Forest over the periods between 2010 and 2020. In this study, SVM gave the best results with 92 percent Overall Accuracy(OA) and 0.90 Kappa Value.

rayyan-220244388,Remote Sensing and Machine Learning Applications for Smart Precision Agriculture: A Review,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"The soil fertility is declining slowly with an increasing population which is not recognizable with naked eye like disasters such as floods and droughts. Therefore, it does not get the as much as attention it requires. Soil pollution emerging as an important threat to soil function for which specific accelerated actions are needed, to maintain nutrient balance, offset the effects of soil pollution, salinization, and soil erosion, and sustains overall soil quality. The physical, chemical, and mineralogical composition of soil is greatly influenced by the processes like weathering, erosion, transportation, and deposition. Thus, an understanding of the processes that controls the behavior of the source material is essential for qualitative as well as quantitative characterization of soil. The sustainable management of soil is directly or indirectly crucial for mineral resource management, nutrient balance, crop production, environmental sustainability, and on human health. Thus, soil heath status study not only will provide an early indication of the problems associated with soil nutrient surplus or a deficit but also it helps in crop yields management. This chapter provides a depth knowledge about the relation between the soil health and nutrient flow by identifying the root cause from the system, i.e., at the field level, farm level, and regional level. This process is done with the help of traditional knowledge and high-resolution 436data like multispectral data, hyperspectral data, and geographic information system (GIS) approach for spatial variability-based methods proposed in this study. This chapter's main focus is to manage the spatial variability of soils and nutrients availability by using the techniques like machine learning (ML) and the internet of things (IoT). Digital information extraction method can be broadly used in agricultural field to help farmers to increase productivity, pest management and land sustainability practices. Agriculture can be integrated into urban and peri-urban areas which can contribute to the self-sufficient neighborhood while, reconnecting people with nature and consumption with production.

rayyan-220244391,Harnessing the Power of AI for Climate Change Impact Assessment,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Climate change impact assessment is critical for creating adequate climate change mitigation and adaptation policies and plans. Critical infrastructure systems (e.g., water and energy systems) are particularly at risk for climate change impacts. In fact, a better understanding of climate change impacts on the water and energy systems would facilitate the fulfillment of SDG2 (end hunger), SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation), SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy), SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities), and SDG 13 (climate action), with many indirect benefits across many other areas. Nonetheless, conducting climate change impact assessment, particularly at the community-level, is not an easy task. Often, the impact assessment models require access to substantial computational resources to run the complex models, as well as the expertise to work with those models and interpret their results, which may not be possible for all communities. As such, there is a need to expand climate change impact assessment to include more accessible models that can handle high-resolution, local data that is of interest to communities. Here, we highlight how climate impact assessment studies can benefit from the power of artificial intelligence (AI). The report details the use of AI model to conduct a computationally efficient climate change impact assessment. This model is applied to a case study across the United States of America (U.S.) as an example to showcase the insights it generates in real-world applications. To demonstrate this process, the study will focus on the impacts on coupled water and electricity demand (e.g., the water-electricity demand nexus). To conduct the impact assessment, the report demonstrates two different means of collecting future climate data—Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5 (CMIP5) Earth System Models (ESMs) and contemporary climate analogs. Our results show significant increases across the Midwestern U.S. when using ESM-derived data. Similar results were found through the climate analog-derived data, suggesting that the analogs can be used successfully as proxies for traditional ESM data in communities that might not have access to the larger CMIP suite of models. Understanding the impacts of climate change on critical infrastructure is important for building sustainable and equitable policies for climate change mitigation and adaptation. These infrastructure systems are often interconnected (e.g., the water-energy nexus) and managed by local entities. Thus, while climate change is a global problem requiring cooperation across countries and sectors, many solutions require local action. In this sense, the results presented here can be used to deepen our scientific understanding of climate change impacts on the water-energy nexus, as well as develop novel methodologies that integrate AI with traditional climate change impact assessment to better prepare local communities for the future.","",https://doi.org/10.53328/inr24ror012,"",,

As a critical component in the hydrological cycle, the wetlands along the YRB have been changing during recent decades because of urbanization, intensive farming (e.g., aquaculture and agriculture) and climate change. Due to the lack of a long-term wetland classification dataset with comprehensive wetland categories, however, there&amp;#8217;s a noticeable gap in the YRB water management regarding the relative roles of different wetland categories on flood resilience. Therefore, this study aimed to generate a long-term wetland classification dataset for the YRB and further investigate the long-term wetland variations on the YRB flood risk assessments for the period from 1985 to 2021. The dataset named Long-Term Wetland Classification Dataset for YRB (LTWCD_YRB) was created using a Random Forest machine learning classifier on Google Earth Engine with 30m resolution Landsat 5, 7, 8 muti-spectral images. The maps of LTWCD_YRB demonstrated the spatial distribution, annual variability, and seasonal cycle of nine wetland categories in the extent, and the total validation accuracy can reach 85%. The LTWCD_YRB indicated that the total wetland area of the YRB in 2021 was larger than that in 1985, with constantly increased human-made wetlands and fluctuated natural wetlands. Aquaculture ponds expanded the most (4,987 km2);&amp;#160;inland marsh in the source region was the wetland category with the most fluctuations. Seasonal changes in wetlands were prominent in the Poyang Lake Basin, Dongting Lake Basin, and YRB source region. The LTWCD_YRB&amp;#160;can offer a consistent agreement of wetland area variations with the other satellite-based wetland datasets in the YRB, which is&amp;#160;valuable for researchers&amp;#160;and stakeholders to better understand the YRB wetlands and would support sustainable wetland management practices.&amp;#160;With the&amp;#160;LTWCD_YRB data as modelling inputs, a GIS-based spatial multi-index&amp;#160;flooding risk assessment model was applied for investigating&amp;#160;the long-term implications of wetland variations on flood risks in the YRB. The model results indicate that in the year with large floods and extremely high precipitation, flood risk level increased obviously after adding the wetland factor. For the years with normal precipitation, flood risk level decreased with wetlands expansion and increased with wetlands shrinkage in the YRB. The long-term expansion of aquaculture ponds contributed to a lower flood risk in the Taihu Lake Basin. In contrast, the Poyang Lake Basin experienced an increasing flood risk due to the long-term shrinkage in lake areas resulting from soil erosion and urbanization along the lakeside. This study would be helpful&amp;#160;for stakeholders to develop feasible wetland management practices, and to improve flood risk resilience in the YRB.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu24-4382,"",,
rayyan-220244447,MULTI-TEMPORAL URBAN LAND-USE CHANGE DETECTION AND PREDICTION USING CNN-BASED CA-MARKOV MODEL FROM GAOFEN SATELLITE IMAGES,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract. The intelligent interpretation of land-use change has become a research frontier. Reasonably and effectively utilizing limited land resources and making scientific predictions to promote sustainable utilization of land resources is significant for establishing a resource-saving and environmentally friendly society. Remote sensing technology can efficiently complete multi-temporal and dynamic land-use change detection, especially using high-spatial resolution remote sensing images. However, the existing land-use change and prediction have not been combined. In addition, land-use change detection mainly relies on shallow feature design, resulting in low prediction accuracy and weak generalization performance. To solve the above problems, we proposed a CNN-based CA Markov model using multi-temporal GaoFen satellite remote sensing images for the change detection and prediction of land cover. Taking the city of Panzhihua in China as an example, the study constructed training sample data that includes a multi-temporal remote sensing training dataset from 2006, 2010, 2015, and 2021 using GaoFen satellite remote sensing images. Meanwhile, a multitemporal CNN land-use detection model was constructed to generate a land-use transfer matrix by training the dataset. Furthermore, the comprehensive driving factors were selected, including terrain factors (height and slope) and social factors (economic and population density). Then, the CA-Markov model was constructed to predict the land-use development trend in Panzhihua City after ten years. Compared with the traditional methods, experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model can improve the model's automatic interpretation ability and prediction accuracy with an increase of 24.6% in the FoM index and 4.37% in the Kappa coefficient.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/isprs-archives-xlviii-m-3-2023-279-2023,"",,

The situation becomes more critical when these hydrologic extremes combine with land use change mainly caused by anthropogenic factors, such as urbanization, intensive farming, and industrial activities. The present study is designed to investigate the combined impacts of climate and land use changes on the future freshwater &amp;#160;stored in the artificial reservoirs of three adjacent river basins located in the central Sicily (Italy), i.e: Verdura (2 active reservoirs with capacities 9.2 Mmc and 4.19 Mmc), Imera Meridionale (one active reservoir with capacity 15 Mmc), and Platani (one active reservoir with capacity 20.7Mmc), using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model. The reservoirs are used for irrigation, drinking water supply, and electric power generation. Future climate variables such as rainfall, minimum and maximum temperatures were derived from an ensemble Regional Climate Models for two main representative concentration pathway (RCP) scenarios, such as an intermediate emission scenario (RCP4.5) and a severe emission scenario (RCP8.5). A coupled multi-layer perceptron neural networks and cellular automata (MLP-CA) model was implemented to simulate future land use of the region considering the CORINE land cover in 2000, 2006, 2012, and 2018 as a reference dataset. The future land use is then projected until the mid-century (2048) in a six-year interval using the validated MLP-CA model. The soil data from the European soil data center (EUSDAC) was used as input for the SWAT model. The result indicated that the basins could experience a decrease in inflows to the reservoirs. The separate evaluation of climate change and land use changes indicated that the effect of climate change on streamflow variation is more pronounced than the effect of land use change only. In this study, we introduced new hydrological insights into the region by analyzing the attributions of climate change, land use change, and coupled climate and land use changes on the future freshwater availability which were overlooked in the previous studies. The implementation of the proposed approach can contribute to design environmentally sustainable and climate resilient river basin management strategies. &amp;#160; Keywords: MLP-CA, Land use change, Climate change, SWAT, Hydrological modeling, Water availability","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu24-4462,"",,

Using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and Remote Sensing (RS) to leverage the dynamic and complex area of LULC, this study examines the potential of different machine learning classification methods. Precise differentiation and classification of various land cover categories, such as green vegetation, urban areas, water bodies, dark green vegetation, and bare terrain, are made possible by the great spatial and spectral resolution of Landsat imagery. For efficient land management and planning, the integration of Landsat data with GIS and RS approaches provides insightful information about the distribution and temporal changes in LULC. This study uses four classifiers to explore the principles of supervised machine learning techniques and identify their drawbacks and advantages. Testing results show that the Support Vector Machine with four kernel linear-99.17%, radial basis (RBF)-99.11%, Sigmoid-99.11% and Polynomial-99.11% is a reliable option for LULC classification, outperforming than other classifiers in terms of accuracy, including the Minimum Distance Classifier (MD-93.47%), Maximum Likelihood Classifier (MLC- 98.98%), and Mahalanobis Distance Classifier (MH-97.83%). Among the tested classifiers, SVM with four kernels notably shows the highest accuracy.

The drastic change in LULC changes the CN. This change directly affects surface water including peak flows. This study aims to assess the change in surface runoff due to changes in LULC. Hydrological modeling is done for the consistent long-term behavioral study of surface runoff. The area focused on the study is the Kharun river, a tributary of the Mahanadi River. For the assessment of the impact of LULC change on the catchment discharge, a daily-step conceptual model soil and water assessment tool (SWAT) was applied. Landuse maps were prepared with the Landsat Thematic Mapper satellite images. The future land use was forecasted with the technique of spatial statistical modeling. The machine learning (ML) tool is used for quantifying the influences on the LULC change dynamics and producing the LULC map for 2024 and 2030. Remote sensing (RS) and geographic information system (GIS) analysis were coupled with hydrological SWAT modeling to investigate the connection between the LULC change and hydrologic regime. The SWAT Model’s calibration efficiency is verified by comparing the simulated and observed discharge time series at the Patharidih gauge and discharge station. The monthly and daily calibrations were quite satisfactory, with Nash-Sutcliffe an efficiency coefficient of 0.86 and 0.67.

Therefore, the assessment and mapping of coastline dynamics is one of the most essential factors for sustainable development goals and urban planning. The objectives of this study are to focus on discussing the research progress of applications of satellite remote sensing datasets and GIS methods for coastline extraction, mapping, and analysis along global coasts. A systematic review and trend analysis of the most recent published studies that focused on remote sensing and GIS techniques for assessing coastal dynamics were published between 2012 and 2022 along different coasts worldwide.

Particularly in tropical island regions, due to the expansion of human activities and land use/cover changes (LUCCs), the risk of SE has been exacerbated. Combining the RUSLE with machine learning methods, SE spatial patterns, their driving forces and the mechanisms of how LUCCs affect SE, were illustrated. Additionally, the potential impacts of future LUCCs on SE were simulated by using the PLUS model. The main results are as follows: (1) Due to LUCCs, the average soil erosion modulus (SEM) decreased significantly from 108.09 t/(km2·a) in 2000 to 106.75 t/(km2·a) in 2020, a reduction of 1.34 t/(km2·a), mainly due to the transformation of cropland to forest and urban land.

However, a comprehensive analysis exploring the relationships between LULCC, and its explanatory variables remains unexplored. This study focused on the Lake Kivu catchment in Rwanda, analysing LULCC from 1990 to 2020, identifying major variables, and predicting future LULC scenarios under different development trajectories. Image classification was conducted in Google Earth Engine using random forest classifier, by incorporating seasonal composites Landsat images, spectral indices, and topographic features, to enhance discrimination and capture seasonal variations. The results demonstrated an overall accuracy exceeding 83%. Historical analysis revealed significant changes, including forest loss (26.6 to 18.7%) and agricultural land expansion (27.7 to 43%) in the 1990–2000 decade, attributed to political conflicts and population movements. Forest recovery (24.8% by 2020) was observed in subsequent decades, driven by Rwanda’s sustainable development initiatives. A Multi-Layer Perceptron neural network from Land Change Modeler predicted distinct 2030 and 2050 LULC scenarios based on natural, socio-economic variables, and historical transitions. Analysis of explanatory variables highlighted the significant role of proximity to urban centers, population density, and terrain in LULCC. Predictions indicate distinct trajectories influenced by demographic and socio-economic trends. The study recommends adopting the Green Growth Economy scenario aligned with ongoing conservation measures.

rayyan-220244560,Global Land Use Change and Its Impact on Greenhouse Gas Emissions,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"ABSTRACT Anthropogenic activities have altered approximately two‐thirds of the Earth's land surface. Urbanization, industrialization, agricultural expansion, and deforestation are increasingly impacting the terrestrial landscapes, leading to shifts of areas in artificial surface (i.e., humanmade), cropland, pasture, forest, and barren land. Land use patterns and associated greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions play a critical role in global climate change. Here we synthesized 29 years of global historical data and demonstrated how land use impacts global GHG emissions using structural equation modeling. We then obtained predictive estimates of future global GHG emissions using a deep learning model. Our results show that, from 1992 to 2020, the global terrestrial areas covered by artificial surface and cropland have expanded by 133% and 6% because of population growth and socioeconomic development, resulting in 4.0% and 3.8% of declines in pasture and forest areas, respectively. Land use was significantly associated with GHG emissions ( p &lt; 0.05). Artificial surface dominates global GHG emissions, followed by cropland, pasture, and barren land. The increase in artificial surfaces has driven up global GHG emissions through the increase in energy consumption. Conversely, improved agricultural management practices have contributed to mitigating agricultural GHG emissions. Forest, on the other hand, serves as a sink of GHG. In total, global GHG emissions increased from 31 to 46 GtCO 2 eq from 1992 to 2020. Looking ahead, if current trends in global land use continue at the same rates, our model projects that global GHG emissions will reach 76 ± 8 GtCO 2 eq in 2050. In contrast, reducing the rates of land use change by half could limit global GHG emissions to 60 ± 3 GtCO 2 eq in 2050. Monitoring and analyzing these projections allow a better understanding of the potential impacts of various land use scenarios on global climate and planning for a sustainable future.","",https://doi.org/10.1111/gcb.17604,"",,
rayyan-220244567,Gene Identification and Map Construction of the Production &amp;minus; Living &amp;minus; Ecological Space in Traditional Villages in the Li River Basin,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"<sec><title>Objective</title> Traditional villages in the Li River Basin are key cultural heritage assets, representing the historical evolution of local societies, architectural traditions, and the complex interactions between human activities and natural landscapes. These villages, which exhibit distinct spatial patterns and cultural expressions, are central to understanding rural cultural landscapes in China. However, rapid urbanization has intensified pressures on these villages, resulting in challenges such as spatial homogenization, functional decline, and disordered development, all of which contribute to the erosion of the unique spatial characteristics of such villages. To address these critical issues, this research aims to identify and analyze the spatial genes of traditional villages in the Li River Basin. By constructing a comprehensive framework that integrates production, living, and ecological spaces, the research seeks to provide a theoretical foundation for the conservation, adaptive reuse, and sustainable management of these traditional landscapes within the broader framework of national and regional territorial spatial planning. </sec><sec><title>Methods</title> The research employs an innovative mixed-methods approach that combines deep learning techniques, spatial feature quantification, and extensive field investigations. A comprehensive spatial information database is developed, drawing information from multiple sources such as remote sensing imagery, historical documents, architectural surveys, and field observations. This database serves as the foundation for spatial analysis, facilitating the identification of spatial genes using a deep learning model, the Dual Attention Network (DANet). The model is designed to enhance spatial feature extraction through a combination of spatial and channel attention mechanisms, with a view to enabling more precise identification of spatial characteristics. The research categorizes spatial genes into three main types: Production space, living space, and ecological space. Production space mainly involves the forms of farmland and the relationship between village and farmland, reflecting the close integration of village with agricultural land. Living space encompasses settlement scale, settlement morphology, and road network patterns. Ecological space includes terrain type, landform type, village – mountain relationship, and village – water relationship, emphasizing the spatial relationship between village location and natural elements like mountains and water. The research also constructs a detailed spatial gene map that visually represents the organization and integration of production, living, and ecological spaces within traditional villages, providing insights into the dynamic interactions among these elements. </sec><sec><title>Results</title> The research identifies 32 distinct spatial gene types across traditional villages in the Li River Basin, which are systematically categorized into four main village types based on their spatial gene combinations and adaptation strategies. The first type, Surrounding Solitary Peak Village, is typically located in low-elevation karst landscapes, characterized by a circular spatial layout around isolated peaks and close proximity to water sources. These villages exhibit a strategic use of natural terrain, enabling effective agricultural production and compact living environments that are adapted to local topography. The second type, Peak Forest Depression Village, is found in hilly and plain karst areas. These villages feature compact living spaces but more dispersed production areas, reflecting adaptations to limited ecological space and a strong reliance on local natural resources. The third type, River Valley Plain Village, is situated along river valleys and plains, with residential and production spaces closely aligned with water channels. These villages often serve as commercial centers with well-developed waterway networks, demonstrating a functional balance between agricultural production and trade activities. The fourth type, Mountainous Hill Village, is located at higher elevations and characterized by stepped terraces, tiered housing, and adaptive land use patterns that integrate with the steep terrain. These villages employ innovative land management strategies, such as contour farming and hillside construction, to maximize the use of available land while maintaining ecological balance. The spatial gene map constructed in this research offers a comprehensive visualization of the spatial organization and integration patterns within these villages, highlighting how different types of traditional villages maintain a balance among production, living, and ecological spaces. The map also reveals varying adaptation strategies shaped by local geographic, cultural, and economic factors, providing valuable insights into the sustainability of traditional village landscapes. </sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title> This research makes significant contributions to traditional village research by introducing an innovative framework for spatial gene identification and analysis, specifically focusing on the Li River Basin. Through the systematic classification of spatial genes into production, living, and ecological spaces, the research not only refines the theoretical understanding of traditional village landscapes, but also provides practical guidance for their conservation and revitalization. The use of the DANet deep learning model enhances the objectivity, precision, and efficiency of spatial gene identification and mapping, thereby establishing a comprehensive spatial gene database. The spatial gene map constructed in this research effectively visualizes the interactions and combination patterns of spatial elements, offering clear insights into the strategies for classification and sustainable development of villages.

rayyan-220244578,"Ecology of Lake Erie - Nutrients, microbes, algae, and dreissenid mussels: A synthesis",,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"The Lake Erie ecosystem, including its physical, chemical, and biological components, has changed considerably during recent decades owing to human-induced environmental stress (Fraker et al., 2022; Makarewicz and Bertram, 1991; Munawar and Munawar, 1976; Sinclair et al., 2021). While much has been learned from monitoring and research activities, a full understanding of how and why the ecosystem has changed is lacking (Fraker et al., 2023; Fussell et al., 2016; Sterner et al., 2017; Scavia et al., 2023), which has hampered the development of management strategies that can help sustain the integrity of the lake and its valued ecosystem services (e.g. clean water, safe recreation, food production). This AEHM special issue is the first of four focused on Lake Erie, all of which will aim to display the science being conducted to enhance ecosystem understanding and guide management decision-making.This special issue centers on watershed, nutrient, microbial (including cyanobacteria), algal, and dreissenid mussel dynamics, including their causes and consequences. Specifically, it focuses on understanding factors that have driven changes in: 1) nutrient loading and in-lake nutrient dynamics; 2) algal and cyanobacteria dynamics; and 3) dreissenid growth, impacts, and spatial variation. After recapping each paper's major messages and management implications, we offer some concluding remarks.Since the early 2000s, Lake Erie has shown signs of intensified eutrophication, including increases in the extent and duration of hypoxia and harmful algal blooms dominated by cyanobacteria (hereafter, cyanoHABs; Scavia et al., 2014; Watson et al., 2016). Some of those symptoms have been linked to altered nutrient dynamics in Lake Erie's watersheds and, particularly, significant increases in dissolved reactive phosphorus loads (Baker et al., 2014; Stumpf et al., 2016). The source of most phosphorus entering Lake Erie is agriculture (Wilson et al., 2018); however, this source is dispersed across the landscape (Kast et al., 2021) and difficult to mitigate. Thus, delineating the characteristics of watersheds that export the largest amount of nutrients is important to identifying locations where nutrient reduction will be most effective. While reducing nutrient input is critical, the behavior of nutrients once they have entered the lake is likely to influence where and when cyanoHABs occur. Toward improving our understanding of eutrophication, two of this AEHM special issue's contributors focused on identifying causes of variation in the dynamics of nutrient loading and approaches to model the availability of these loads on chemicophysical conditions.Johnson et al. (2023) sought to identify how watershed characteristics have influenced nutrient and sediment inputs into western Lake Erie. To this end, these authors used a suite of physical attributes, land uses, and point-source contributions to characterize seven tributary watersheds, six of which are Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement Annex 4 priority watersheds, and five sub-watersheds. The authors then used principal components regression analysis to determine their relationship with nutrient and sediment yields into Lake Erie. Briefly, their results demonstrated spatial (regional) variation in contributions of nutrients and sediments from each river during 2017-2021 that was related to watershed attributes. For example, nutrient inputs into Lake Erie from watersheds were positively related to the percentage of land supporting cultivated crops and poorly drained soils, with higher slopes and lower amounts of pasture being positively correlated with sediment yields. These authors then discussed their findings in the context of impending nutrient reductions aimed at mitigation of Lake Erie's recent re-eutrophication (Baker et al., 2019), explaining how consideration of regional differences in nutrient and sediment yields could benefit nutrient management planning.While Johnson et al. centered on factors that influence nutrient and sediment loading into Lake Erie, Bocaniov et al. (2023) focused how nutrient (total phosphorus, TP) inputs affect within-lake TP movement and distribution. These authors used an updated phosphorus mass-balance model (2003-2016) to derive TP load-response relationships and response matrices to predict steady-state lake TP concentrations as a function of variable external TP inputs. A key finding is that inter-basin transfer of TP plays a large role in driving basin-specific TP concentrations (e.g. inflow from the central basin contributes ∼70% of the resident TP in the eastern basin). Bocaniov et al.'s modeling also demonstrated that western Lake Erie is likely to respond quickly (93 days) to reduced TP inputs, with longer response times estimated in the central and eastern basins (540 and 303 days, respectively). These authors then discuss how their findings can help guide where in the watershed to manage nutrients and what timeframes may be needed before agencies can expect to see impacts of nutrient abatement efforts.An outcome of excessive agricultural nutrient loading into aquatic ecosystems is enhanced primary production. Lake Erie has experienced increases in benthic algae (e.g. Cladophora), pelagic algae, and cyanobacteria during both past (1960s-1970s) and more recent eutrophication events (Munawar and Munawar, 1996; O'Donnell et al., 2023; Vollenweider et al., 1974; Watson et al., 2016). Lake Erie is a large and complex ecosystem, however, and the specific type or location of algal blooms cannot be predicted by nutrient loading alone. Rather, how and where blooms form will depend on complex processes such as gazing pressure and nutrient availability within the lake, as well as water warming that will interact with high nutrient availability. With this backdrop, four papers in this AEHM special issue sought to enhance our ability to understand and describe the dynamics of primary producers, including algae and cyanobacteria.To help better understand the mechanisms responsible for benthic Cladophora outbreaks in eastern Lake Erie since dreissenid mussels colonized the lake, Depew et al. (2023) quantified the enzymatically hydrolysable portion (EHP) of dissolved organic phosphorus (DOP). Samples were collected during May through September 2019 at varying depths along the north shore of the eastern basin. These authors found that the EHP substantially contributed to the dissolved P pool, with this contribution averaging 53% of the total dissolved P and 63% of the DOP concentration. Hence, a large amount of DOP appears bioavailable owing to enzymatic hydrolysis. This result, combined with the fact that bioavailable DOP concentrations often exceeded dissolved reactive P concentrations, indicates an increased role of the benthic contributions to P bioavailability in the eastern basin since the establishment of dreissenid mussels. In turn, Depew et al. highlight the need to consider EHP when designing management strategies to control Cladophora outbreaks in the eastern basin.In contrast to Depew et al., Hoffman et al. (2023) quantified seasonal nitrification in Lake Erie's water column and explored its potential role in driving microbial dynamics, including cyanoHABs dominated by Microcystis spp. To do so, these authors used the stable isotope, 15NH4+, to track nitrification and qPCR to determine the relative abundances of ammonia oxidizing organisms (i.e. bacteria and Archaea, AOO) during 2015-2017. Hoffman et al. found that nitrification rates were lower during cyanoHABs, suggesting that AOOs were not good competitors with cyanobacteria for ammonia. These low rates can in part explain why cyanoHABs dominated by Microcystis spp. (non-nitrogen fixers) can persist despite low bioavailable nitrogen (N). Further, the removal of bioavailable N via coupled nitrification-denitrification is lower than the increase in bioavailable N through regeneration and external N loading. Using these findings, Hoffman et al. discuss the importance of reducing N loading into Lake Erie as a means to help reduce seasonal cyanoHABs.Hounshell et al. (2023) also focused on understanding cyanoHAB dynamics, exploring the role of P as a driver instead of N. While total bioavailable P (TBP) loading from the Maumee River (Ohio, USA) during spring has been shown to be a strong predictor of cyanoHAB severity in western Lake Erie (Baker et al., 2014; Bertani et al., 2016; Stumpf et al., 2016), much unexplained variation in cyanoHAB severity remains. Thus, Hounshell et al. (2023) sought to identify environmental variables that could improve the predictive relationship between the Maumee River spring TBP load and cyanoHAB severity. Their modeling showed that at both low (< 273 MTA) and high (> 332 MTA) TBP loads levels, no other environmental factors improved predictive accuracy of cyanoHABs in western Lake Erie. However, during years with intermediate springtime TBP loads (273-332 MTA), predictions of cyanoHABs could be improved by considering winter and July TBP loads, as well as ice extent and phenology. While their work is still ongoing, Hounshell et al.'s research highlights the value of both tributary and in-lake monitoring, as well as process-based modeling to cyanoHAB forecasting.Wang et al. (2023) also sought to use modeling to predict the distribution of cyanoHABs in Lake Erie. Specifically, these authors compared the performance of the one-dimensional (1D) Aquatic Ecosystem Dynamics–General Lake Model (AED–GLM) and the three-dimensional (3D) Aquatic Ecosystem Model (AEM3D–iWQ) in predicting cyanoHABs, phytoplankton biomass (as measured by chlorophyll a), and associated physicochemical conditions (e.g. water temperature, nutrients), among other things, in western Lake Erie during 2008 and 2011-2014. By qualitatively comparing their results to in situ observations, Wang et al. showed that the 3D model better reproduced seasonal and spatial variation in nutrients and phytoplankton with less error than the 1D model. Conversely, cyanoHABs were better predicted by the 1D model. As detailed in their paper, Wang et al. explain how the scale at which these models are calibrated can drive differences in model performance. These authors also discuss the implications of their findings for choosing the appropriate model to support management endeavors, including how to best calibrate them to achieve desired goals.The final set of papers centered on invasive dreissenid mussels, which have become a ubiquitous part of the Great Lakes since their introduction nearly four decades ago (Nalepa et al., 2005). Owing to their potential to negatively impact native mussels (Schloesser et al., 2006), zooplankton communities (Johannsson et al., 2000), phytoplankton biomass (Bocaniov et al., 2014), and nutrient cycling (Hecky et al., 2004), Zebra (Dreissena polymorpha) and Quagga (D. rostiformis bugensis) Mussels have garnered the interest of researchers and management agencies alike. Much of this effort has been devoted to understanding the mechanisms that influence dreissenid demographics and impacts of the food web, which are the focus of the last set of papers in this AEHM special issue.To understand the growth dynamics of dreissenid mussels and their impact on phytoplankton in western Lake Erie, Carter et al. (2023) combined field surveys, in situ growth experiments, and laboratory excretion and grazing experiments. Their results, which are important in interpreting two of the remaining AEHM special issue papers, showed that dreissenid communities have lower clearance rates and excretion rates compared to previously reported rates. This understanding, combined with reduced dreissenid densities in Lake Erie during recent decades, led Carter et al. to conclude that the ability of dreissenids to compound the effect of eutrophication that causes cyanoHABs may be less than previously thought (e.g. Vanderploeg et al., 2009; but see Carrick et al., 2023 and Vanderploeg et al., 2023). Carter et al. (2023) acknowledge, however, that the impact of dreissenids could be locally high at times, owing to their patchy distribution across the basin. In turn, these authors stress the need for frequent, fine-scale benthic surveys, which could improve ability to understand and forecast the impacts of dreissenids on the ecosystem.Carrick et al. (2023) also sought to quantify the impact of dreissenid mussels on plankton assemblages (heterotrophs and phototrophs) in western Lake Erie. Using controlled experiments conducted monthly during May through October 2018, these authors show that dreissenids graze actively throughout the growing season, consuming nano-sized heterotrophic and phototrophic plankton (e.g. phototrophic cryptophytes, centric diatoms, and non-pigmented chrysomonads). By contrast, lower clearance rates of cyanobacteria (e.g. Microcystis spp.), dinoflagellates, and some colonial chlorophytes were observed. Carrick et al. further suggest that selective dreissenid grazing on ""non-harmful"" plankton species in the nanoplankton size range, combined with lower grazing rates on larger cyanobacteria and chlorophyte species, could contribute to western Lake Erie's cyanoHAB problem. Notably, the small-scale experimental results of Carrick et al. contrast those from Carter et al.'s (2023) field-based study. This discrepancy highlights the value of both experimental and field-based approaches, as well as the need to carefully consider the spatiotemporal context of the investigation, when to quantifying the role of dreissenid grazing as a secondary promoter (above nutrient loading) of cyanoHABs.Vanderploeg et al. (2023) also used an experimental approach to quantity the impacts of dreissenid mussel grazing on the phytoplankton community. Their experiments showed that grazing pressure on phytoplankton varied during May through October, with grazing on cryptophytes and diatoms being high during late May through early July. Despite cyanophytes dominating the phytoplankton beginning in late July, dreissenid grazing on them was non-existent or low. Interestingly, 16S rRNA gene-sequencing analyses showed a diverse cyanobacteria community with Planktothrix dominating during the spring and Cyanobium dominating most of the summer through fall. By contrast, Microcystis, which is largely thought to dominate cyanoHABs in Lake Erie, only dominated during late June. Further, Microcystis was preferentially rejected by Quagga Mussels relative to other cyanobacteria. Using these findings, Vanderploeg et al. draw a similar conclusion as Carrick et al. (2023) by suggesting that dreissenid grazing can favor specific cyanobacteria such as Microcystis. Importantly, however, the final effect of dreissenid grazing as a secondary promoter of cyanoHABS depends on the population density of dreissenids, which is currently low (Carter et al., 2023).In this special issue's final paper, Elgin et al. (2023) conducted an in situ study to quantify spatial variation in colonization potential, growth rates, and abundance of dreissenid mussels at two sites with contrasting water-column conditions in western Lake Erie. Despite finding comparable dreissenid colonization potential and growth between study sites, both on and in the experimental cages, Elgin et al. found fewer mussels in the surrounding sediment at the site nearer the Maumee River. These authors use this finding to conclude that water-column conditions appear to favor dreissenid settlement and growth on hard surfaces suspended above the substrate across the western basin, but that conditions on or near the substrate may inhibit mussel settling and growth. Elgin et al. eventually discuss how substrate-driven bottlenecks could inform our understanding of dreissenid recruitment and distribution, as well as nutrient dynamics, in western Lake Erie. These authors also suggest how better characterization of substrate conditions could support dreissenid control efforts.Owing to the impact of humans, the world's ecosystems have been experiencing dramatic change, which has threatened their structure, function, and dynamics, as well as their capacity to support services valued by society. The world's Great Lakes are no exception with these ecosystems being degraded by numerous anthropogenic stressors, including nutrient alteration (both eutrophication and oligotrophication), non-native species invasions, habitat destruction, and climate change, among many others (Allan et al., 2013; Jenny, 2020; Odada et al., 2003). The magnitude, multitude, and simultaneous nature of these stressors have in turn challenged both researchers seeking to understand the dynamics of these ecosystems and agencies charged with managing the valued natural resources (e.g. fish, wildlife) and other services (e.g. safe drinking water, recreational opportunities) that these ecosystems provide (Allan et al., 2013; Odada and Olago, 2006; Sterner et al., 2017). Such challenges highlight the need for continued research aimed at understanding the causes and consequences of anthropogenic change.While all the large lakes of the world have been altered by anthropogenic stress, Lake Erie is among the most degraded. Its susceptibility to anthropogenic stress is largely due to its small size, shallow depth, high connectivity via shipping, and large watershed that supports both large cities and agricultural production (Fraker et al, 2022; Ludsin et al., 2001; Reutter, 2019). Most relevant to this AEHM special issue, Lake Erie has shifted trophic states multiple times in response to human impacts and subsequent mitigation efforts. Prior to the 1950s, Lake Erie was primarily in a pre-industrial state of mesotrophy-oligotrophy and shifted to a state of hypertrophy-mesotrophy during the 1960s-1970s. During the 1980s-1990s, it shifted back to more mesotrophic conditions in response to both mitigation efforts designed to reduce point-source inputs of TP and the invasion of dreissenid mussels. Most recently (post 2000), Lake Erie returned to a more eutrophic state due to non-point source runoff of dissolved reactive phosphorus (Kane et al., 2014; Ludsin et al., 2001; Sinclair et al., 2023; Vollenweider et al., 1974). Concomitantly, Lake Erie has currently been experiencing increases in the magnitude and extent of both bottom hypoxia and cyanoHABs (Scavia et al., 2014; Watson et al., 2016), which are threatening: human health through cyanotoxin exposure (e.g. Francy et al., 2016; Wituszynski et al., 2017); fish populations and the fisheries that they support (e.g. Stone et al., 2020; Wolf et al., 2017); and the regional economy through effects on tourism and property values (Smith et al., 2019; Wolf et al., 2022). These threats have increased the need for the science necessary to make informed management decisions (Fraker et al., 2023; Fussell et al., 2016; Sterner et al., 2017; Scavia et al., 2023), which includes describing the current state of the Lake Erie ecosystem and understanding the causal mechanisms of recent ecosystem change.The contributions to this AEHM special issue have provided new insights into the drivers of nutrient inputs, in-lake nutrient concentrations, benthic algae (Cladophora), planktonic heterotrophs, microbial autotrophs (including cyanobacteria responsible for cyanoHABs), algae (e.g. diatoms, cryptophytes), and dreissenid mussels. Further, each study has provided information that could benefit management, whether it be ecological understanding that could support ecosystem modeling (e.g. quantifying dreissenid distributions and their impacts on grazing rates and nutrient excretion; Carter et al., 2023; Elgin et al., 2023) or tools that could support nutrient management decision-making (e.g. Bocaniov et al., 2023; Johnson et al, 2023), cyanoHAB severity (e.g. Carrick et al.,. 2023; Hounshell et al., 2023; Vanderploeg et al., 2023) or chemicophysical conditions, including algal and cyanobacteria biomass (e.g. Depew et al., 2023; Hoffman et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023). While many additional messages can be found in the papers, collectively, three key conclusions can be made. First, findings from each of the three focal areas of this AEHM special issue highlight the need to consider fine spatial and/or temporal scales in both the watershed and the lake proper. Doing so offers a means to fully appreciate the complex array of processes driving the dynamics of Lake Erie's chemicophysical conditions and lower food web (e.g. primary producers, dreissenid mussels). Second, while the papers in this special issue showed the value of field-, laboratory-, and modeling-based research to describing, understanding, or predicting ecosystem conditions, they also pointed to challenges that can arise when integrating findings. For example, discrepancies can arise owing to studies being conducted in different settings (e.g. in the laboratory vs. in the field) or at different spatiotemporal scales (e.g. see Carrick et al., 2023; Carter et al., 2023; Vanderploeg et al., 2023). Finally, most papers demonstrated the need for continued and intensified monitoring (e.g. broader coverage at finer spatial and temporal scales), which will challenge agencies responsible for tracking ecosystem conditions. We expect, however, that continued improvement in our ability to cost-effectively monitor Lake Erie and its watershed via remote sensing technologies (Yang et al., 2022; Yin et al., 2021), combined with continually improving data-analytic approaches (e.g. machine and deep learning; Sun and Scanlon, 2019), will help agencies meet this challenge.While the research described in this AEHM special issue has addressed many knowledge gaps, many more remain. Our hope is that continued reporting of findings as part of this AEHM Ecology of Lake Erie series will increase our ability to understand and model the structure, function, and dynamics of the ecosystem. Such understanding and tools should facilitate our continued movement towards ecosystem-based management in the Great Lakes, which could help agencies rehabilitate the lake and sustainably manage its valued resources in the face of continued anthropogenic stress.We thank Ken Minns for providing helpful feedback on a previous version of this synthesis.","",https://doi.org/10.14321/aehm.026.04.131,"",,
rayyan-220244593,"Earth Observations, Digital Footprints and Machine-Learning: Greenhouse Gas Stocktaking for Climate Change Mitigation",,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Introduction &amp; BackgroundMethane (CH4) is a powerful greenhouse gas, leaving both a physical and digital footprint from natural (40%) and human (60%) sources. Its atmospheric concentration has increased from 722 ppb before the industrial age to ~1,922 ppb in recent times. Because of its global warming potential, measuring and monitoring CH4 is crucial to mitigating the impacts of climate change. However, large uncertainties exist in “bottom-up” inventories (a product of activity data based on counts of components, equipment or throughput, and estimates of gas-loss rates per unit of activity for different land uses) reported to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, making it difficult for policymakers to set emission reduction targets. To address this, we employ causality-constrained machine learning (ML) to combine different gas observations from satellite sensors onboard the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (which measure a digital footprint of human methane-generating behaviour) with outputs from chemical modelling. These are linked with datasets from the national statistics office, meteorology office and a comprehensive survey on quality of life in the emission field, to improve bottom-up estimates of CH4 emissions at the Earth’s surface. Objectives &amp; ApproachThe research uses mixed methods for collecting and analysing both qualitative and quantitative data for multidisciplinary processing strategies for monitoring CH4 emissions locally and regionally. It also assesses whether additional “digital footprint” variables besides the well-known chemical sources and sinks can be studied to improve our understanding of the CH4 budget. We have conducted an “analytical inversion” of satellite observations of CH4 to obtain emission fluxes. These represent the dependent variable for our ML model, in combination with 22 independent variables (co-occurring trace gases, meteorological fields, land use, land cover, population, livestock, and data from a survey of quality of life from the Gauteng City-Region Observatory, covering a broad range of socio-economic, personal and political issues) with near-real-time Earth observation data, to aid the development of a causality-constrained ML model for the prediction of CH4 fluxes. Relevance to Digital FootprintsWe make use of not only satellite imagery, but socio-economic, demographic, and environmental data, and repurpose it for environmental sustainability in the context of mitigating climate change. We are creating unique resources in documenting rapid changes in emissions. Conclusions &amp; ImplicationsThis research will make important contributions to developing countries with limited resources, enabling them to contribute to the global stocktake towards net-zero by helping policymakers identify geographic regions that are major emitters, enabling them to put measures into place to mitigate emissions.","",https://doi.org/10.23889/ijpds.v9i4.2423,"",,
