rayyan-220246746,Global monitoring of vegetation conditions and GPP from 30 years of passive microwave observations,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span&amp;gt;Microwave radiation emitted by the Earth surface is&amp;amp;#160;attenuated by vegetation. The magnitude of attenuation is commonly referred to as Vegetation Optical Depth (VOD) and depends on several factors, such as the water content of the vegetation and the wavelength of the sensor. It can be derived from space-borne microwave radiometers and has been explored for multiple applications including drought and biomass monitoring. Here, we present two&amp;amp;#160;novel applications based on long-term multi-satellite observations of VOD: 1) the Standardized VOD Index (SVODI) for&amp;amp;#160;monitoring vegetation condition and 2) modelling Gross Primary Production (VODCA2GPP). &amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#160;&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span&amp;gt;SVODI [1] is a standard normally distributed index indicating the condition of vegetation.&amp;amp;#160;Traditional index generation methods struggle to combine data from multiple data sources and often either exhibit a changing variance over time due to changing input sensors, or are biased. We solve these issues with a new probabilistic merging method, which in principle can be applied to other datasets as well. We show that SVODI, which is an indicator of vegetation structure, biomass and water content, supplements existing vegetation condition indexes based on optical data, which mostly represent the greenness of the vegetation. In the presentation, we also assess spatio-temporal patterns and trends of extreme SVODI values.&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#160;&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span&amp;gt;VODCA2GPP [2] is a global GPP dataset derived from VOD using a sink-driven approach. It uses a machine learning framework using the VOD Climate Archive (VODCA), a long-term coherent dataset based on multiple sensors [3], in combination with FLUXNET in situ GPP observations to predict GPP at a global scale for a period of 30 years. VODCA2GPP exhibits similar spatial and temporal patterns as existing observation-based global GPP datasets from FLUXCOM and MODIS, but with a consistent positive bias. While VODCA2GPP reveals no significant global trend, it does show several regional trends, some of which corroborate trends found in the TRENDY model ensemble.&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#160;&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span&amp;gt;Both datasets are available for free from open data repositories.&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#160;&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span&amp;gt;[1]&amp;amp;#160;Moesinger, L., Zotta, R.M., van der Schalie, R.,&amp;amp;#160;Scanlon, T., de Jeu, R.A.M., Dorigo, W.&amp;amp;#160;Monitoring Vegetation Condition using Microwave Remote Sensing: The Standardized Vegetation Optical Depth Index SVODI, in rev.&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#160;&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span&amp;gt;[2] Wild, B., Teubner, I., Moesinger, L., Zotta, R.-M., Forkel, M., van der Schalie, R., Sitch, S., Dorigo, W.

rayyan-220247104,Weakly Supervised Learning for Pixel-Level Sea Ice Concentration Extraction Using AI4Arctic Sea Ice Challenge Dataset,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"High-resolution sea ice concentration (SIC) maps are critical to support various applications, e.g., climate modeling, ship navigation and activities in Northern communities. However, operational mapping of SIC based on expert annotations is coarse in spatial resolution and time-consuming to prepare. Although many convolutional neural networks (CNNs)-based methods have been proposed for automated sea ice mapping from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery in recent years, the lack of pixel-based labels for model training hinders them from producing high resolution reliable mapping results. To overcome this challenge, this paper presents a novel weakly supervised learning approach that generates pixel-level SIC prediction using coarse region/polygon-level SIC ground truth. Specifically, a novel region-level loss function is designed to enable direct use of regional/polygon SIC values in ice charts for the training of a U-Net-based model. This avoids the errors in transferring region-level SIC values to pixel-level ground-truth SIC values effectively and allows the generation of pixel-level SIC and sea ice extent (SIE) estimates. The proposed approach is evaluated on the recently-published AI4Arctic Sea Ice Challenge Dataset with over 500 Sentinel-1 SAR scenes, ancillary data, and associated ice charts. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the weakly supervised model in producing pixel-level high-resolution SIC maps that are consistent with ice-charts and visual interpretation.","",https://doi.org/10.1109/lgrs.2023.3338061,"",,

While our understanding of the general importance of these coral reefs as reservoirs of biodiversity is commonly accepted, attempts at quantifying how many species live in the oceans, or on coral reefs, is a much more complex question to answer. Our best attempts to put concrete numbers on total marine biodiversity have produced wildly discrepant numbers that differ by up to several orders of magnitude, depending on the methodology employed (e.g. compare [2] with [3]). Total coral reef biodiversity is a particularly obtuse problem, due to the inherently complex three-dimensional structure of these reefs [4] (figure 1a). The cracks and crevices of reefs produce space and microenvironments that can harbour multitudes of diverse organisms (figure 1b). Key to these ecosystems are the hermatypic corals themselves, largely zooxanthellate scleractinians (Cnidaria: Hexacorallia: Scleractinia), which via their symbioses with family Symbiodiniaceae zooxanthellae, produce the calcium carbonate structures that form reefs over time. Figure 1. (a) Overall landscape of a coral reef in Okinawa, southern Japan, with scleractinian corals and fishes visible, and (b) close-up three-dimensional structure of a coral reef in Okinawa, with green macroalgae, crustose coralline algae, turf algae, octocorals, zoantharians, scleractinian corals and foraminifers visible. Images: (a) = F.G., (b) = J.D.R.Download figureOpen in new tabDownload PowerPoint Comparatively speaking, we know a fair amount about the diversity of the reef-building scleractinian corals, due to their skeletal structures and the numerous features within, making taxonomy and the counting of coral species seemingly within our reach. However, these cnidarian groups have often remained taxonomically recalcitrant due to a myriad of reasons. Especially when viewed in situ or via photographs, coral identification can be a challenge, as microscale-skeletal structures often need to be examined to achieve reliable results. As they are ecosystem engineers, no ecological study of a coral reef is complete without coral abundance or diversity indices of some kind: scientists need to be able to count coral species and abundances effectively and accurately. These indices are the necessary foundation to investigate temporal changes and their causes and consequences. Ecologists can count corals via in situ observations, usually via SCUBA, which comes with a number of limitations, such as inherent risks, logistical effort, availability and accessible water depths. Other options that are becoming increasingly popular include remotely operated underwater vehicles (ROVs) or similar tools [5]. Sampling of coral colonies is another, invasive approach, but this is also time-consuming and damaging to reefs when performed at large scale, as well as limited in nature; one cannot sample every coral colony on a reef, and researchers' time underwater is limited by their air consumption. Alternately, transects or quadrats can generate two-dimensional photographic images that can later be analysed without time constraints [6], but these methods are often limited in resolution and neglect the three-dimensional nature of reefs. Three-dimensional photogrammetry methods solve this problem [7], but require large amounts of both computing power and time, and analyses are still limited to what the observer and their camera can see from above or outside of coral colonies, and cannot yet be applied at the wider scale of coral reefs. Environmental DNA (eDNA) applications therefore are ideal complements to traditional survey methods to increase detection rates and robustness of biodiversity monitoring. eDNA has the potential to non-invasively generate large amounts of marine biodiversity data [8], making it perfect for significantly improving our understanding of coral reef diversity. The first step of conducting an eDNA monitoring endeavour starts with the collection of an environmental medium that acts as source of eDNA. Sources thereby include water samples containing free DNA molecules or even whole organisms, mucus, faecal matter, gut contents or benthic sediment. The selection of source material can already influence the results, as benthic sediments and water samples can return different communities in the analyses, as well as the depth at which water samples were taken. Subsequent steps include processing and storage of the environmental samples, with the general consensus to process the samples as swiftly as possibly to prevent degradation of DNA molecules. Various protocols have been proposed for extracting DNA from environmental samples, but all generally seem to lead to satisfactory levels of DNA quantity and quality. Depending on the marker system used for amplification of the extracted DNA, single species can be focused on, or alternately even a whole community across a wide range of reef taxa with metabarcoding assays. While it may be sufficient to only detect positive PCR signals for single species confirmation, or investigate their abundance using quantitative PCR, DNA metabarcoding extends the principles of conventional molecular barcoding to mixed template samples using next-generation sequencing methods. Depending on the sequencing platform, thousands to millions of sequences are retrieved, which then need to undergo bioinformatic analyses. There are several potential ways described to process these sequences; all include quality filtering steps to exclude low quality, short, or erroneous reads. The result of the bioinformatic metabarcoding analyses usually consists of a list of sequences from all samples, which can then be compared with reference databases, resulting in a list of taxa that reflects the observed biodiversity of the eDNA sampling approach [8]. These results from eDNA studies have already helped to detect invasive, rare and cryptic species, as well as designate bioindicator species. On subtropical and tropical coral reefs, several eDNA studies have been already conducted, investigating coral diversity or even whole coral reef communities. Results so far indicate that eDNA applications can potentially be used to quantify coral cover, identify community differences within a reef system (e.g. lagoon versus reef slope), differentiate between communities along an anthropogenic stress gradient, as well as elucidate temporal patterns of coral spawning events [9–12]. The study of Nishitsuji et al. [13] demonstrates the successful large-scale use of eDNA to illuminate the scleractinian coral diversity around an entire island, Okinawa Island, southern Japan. The authors collected and examined eDNA from more than 60 locations around Okinawa Island, amplified mitochondrial marker sequences (12S ribosomal DNA) using a recently developed primer set [14] and compared their results with observations by divers at the same sites. Importantly, while both datasets were generally comparable, with similar results across sites, the eDNA dataset included more detected coral genera than the divers, and this was supported in statistical analyses. As well, the eDNA dataset included the first molecular records of at least two coral species or genera around Okinawa Island. Records and distributions form the bases of biodiversity data, and it is clear eDNA can contribute to enriching such important databases, highlighted by the detection of species not previously reported from the reefs of Okinawa. Additionally, the eDNA and diver-based datasets matched at approximately two-thirds of the sites, and at least a partial match was achieved at 91% of sites, cross-validating each method. However, which dataset should be followed when datasets do not match, as seen in two of the sites in Nishitsuji et al. [13]? This is a difficult question, and one that eDNA methodologies need to overcome. Is a diver-based assessment more reliable, perhaps due to varying primer sensitivity or mismatches [15]? Or are the eDNA data more reliable, revealing what the human diver eye cannot see? Given that most scleractinian corals should be relatively visible to the diving ecologist's eyes, it is probably very rare for eDNA methods to generate data for a coral that cannot be found with repeated focused dives. It should be noted this situation may not be applicable for other taxa that are smaller, more cryptic, or microbial. Thus, more investigation into comparisons between visual and eDNA datasets for a variety of taxa are needed to raise the reputation of eDNA methodologies for lay ecologists, as are the generation of more and different eDNA primer sets for corals or other targeted taxa. Given the exponentially increasing amount of genetic information available for marine taxa, such goals should be relatively easy to achieve and will also lay the foundation for research projects into the future. Finally, Nishitsuji et al.'s research is a welcome focus on the coral reefs of Okinawa and southern Japan [13]. It has long been recognized that the coral reefs in this region are not only comparably endemic and diverse, but also under high levels of threat due to their comparatively small area and rising anthropogenic pressures [16]. eDNA surveys and monitoring can help scientists in the region target areas for more in-depth surveys, and document biodiversity changes over time, as the extracted DNA, if stored correctly, can also serve as an archive of the biodiversity at the specific time point of the sampling. As well, amplification with marker systems targeting other marine taxa is still possible with the extracted DNA, which can help further elucidate previously unseen aspects of coral reefs. Furthermore, the successful use of eDNA for the investigation of shallow water reefs shows that this technique also has great potential for the investigation of mesophotic reef systems that are beyond the reach of SCUBA and can only be reached with increased technical effort. Can eDNA methodologies unlock biodiverse mysteries of coral reefs? Not alone. Cutting-edge technologies need a solid foundation, and eDNA is no different. The accuracy of eDNA depends on the accuracy and completeness of baseline data for target taxa, and thus cannot replace specimen-based taxonomy and biodiversity studies, which generate taxonomic frameworks and reference databases. The quality and reliability of eDNA monitoring results are thereby directly related to the quality and quantity of the available reference sequences. This can potentially lead to a large part of sequences recovered, be it amplicon sequence variants (OTUs) or operational taxonomic units (ASVs), that cannot be determined. Simply put, what is not part of a reference database cannot be found in eDNA analyses. In addition, databases may not be up to date with the latest taxonomy or may inadvertently contain incorrect information or misidentifications. These circumstances can lead to wrong taxonomic assignments in eDNA datasets. These problems can be common and often limit the integration potential of visual and eDNA data. In this context, the increasing reliance on eDNA methods in biomonitoring and marine ecology makes collection-based studies and biodiversity collections and well-curated repositories more important than ever, particularly given the rising extinction threats to our biodiversity in the Anthropocene. Scleractinian corals, unlike many marine taxa, represent an ideal group to work with in both visual surveys and with eDNA methodologies, and such studies can serve as templates for other taxa. More visual+eDNA studies similar to Nishitsuji et al. [13] across other taxa will help researchers expand and better integrate such datasets across the Tree of Life in the future. It is clear that eDNA offers massive potential to the future of coral reef ecology. While transects and imagery remain the de facto standard datasets in coral reef ecology, eDNA is being increasingly deployed, and the question as to which methodology paints a 'truer' picture of a reef is an open one. As well, what methodological approach best solves the needs of each study or conservation manager should be considered; often a rough idea of what diversity is present and how it changes in space and time may be enough for the question at hand. Both in situ diver-based and eDNA methods still have questions regarding taxonomic resolution, due to the above-mentioned issues regarding marine biodiversity (many coral reef animals remain undescribed) and taxonomy (scleractinian corals, for example, are undergoing revisions due to difficulties in often clearly delineating species boundaries). Additionally, mtDNA primers as used in Nishitsuji et al. [13] do not delineate to the species level for a range of coral taxa due to the conservative nature of mtDNA in most anthozoans [17], thus limiting potential for monitoring at such fine taxonomic resolution. Finally, as has been demonstrated in many studies [18,19], robust control sampling and measures to prevent contamination are always recommended to increase the reliability of results. Continued efforts to address all of these issues are needed alongside progress in eDNA methodologies. Regardless, eDNA represents a powerful tool for marine ecologists and coral reef science. As Nishitsuji et al. [13] have done, collecting and comparing imagery and eDNA datasets should become the standard for many studies in the near future, and we can envision a future in which eDNA data alone could be recognized as the most representative information of any given coral reef. Combined with imagery acquisition from underwater drones and ROVs [5], and streamlined AI-assisted imagery analyses [6], and the future of coral reef ecology and diversity studies will undoubtedly reveal major new discoveries. Progressive development of eDNA methodologies will lead to increasing incorporation of eDNA into the best practices for marine resource management and monitoring. The paper by Nishitsuji et al. [13] is an important step toward this exciting new future in coral reef ecology. Data accessibility This article has no additional data.

rayyan-220248039,A seamless coastal to global ocean pCO2 and pH reconstruction at a 0.25-degree resolution with extrapolation to the near future,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Observational networks monitoring marine carbon variables are established to meet the critical need to estimate ocean CO2 uptake, as well as assessing its consequences on ocean health through changes in carbonate chemistry (ocean acidification). Despite considerable efforts over the past decades, data coverage is still sparse over large ocean regions, prompting the implementation of mapping methods to gap-fill carbon datasets over the globe. Different statistical approaches have been proposed with the aim to generate reconstructions of the complete marine CO2 system at high spatial-temporal resolutions. Following this goal, we first introduce a global reconstruction of surface ocean partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2) at monthly and 0.25-degree resolutions over the period 1985-2021. This high-resolution pCO2 product is derived from ensemble neural network models interpolating monthly gridded observation-based data from Surface Ocean CO2 ATlas (SOCAT). We will assess the ability of the proposed pCO2 ensemble (1) to derive long-term time series of pCO2 and associated 1-sigma uncertainty per 0.25-degree grid cell for each month, (2) to reproduce temporal and horizontal gradients of coastal pCO2 observations in comparison with a coarser spatial resolution, (3) to estimate surface ocean pH and air-sea CO2 fluxes. Furthermore, we will present an extension of the ensemble neural network models, which is referred to as a new module extrapolating pCO2 to several years ahead. The extended ensemble-based approach will ultimately be used to project global ocean CO2 uptake and ocean acidification with low latency.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu23-14024,"",,
rayyan-220248292,Self-Supervised Contrastive Model for Flood Mapping and Monitoring on SAR Time-Series,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Flooding is a natural disaster that has been increasing in recent years due to climate and land-use changes. Earth observations, such as Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data, are valuable for assessing and mitigating the negative impacts of flooding. Cloud cover is highly correlated with flooding events, making SAR a preferable choice over optical data for flood mapping and monitoring.Traditional methods for flood mapping and monitoring using SAR data, such as otsu and CVA, can be affected by noise, false detections due to shadows and occlusions, and geometric distortions. While automatic thresholding can be effective with these methods, manual adjustment of the threshold is often required to produce an accurate change map.&amp;#160;Supervised deep learning methods using large amounts of labeled data could potentially improve the accuracy of flood mapping and monitoring. We have a large amount of earth observation data, but the availability of labeled data is limited and labeling data is time-consuming and requires domain expertise. On the other hand, Supervised model training on small datasets causes severe generalizability issues when inference is taken on a new site.&amp;#160;To address these challenges, we propose a novel self-supervised method for mapping and monitoring floods on Sentinel-1 SAR time-series data. We propose a probabilistic model trained on unlabeled data using self-supervised techniques, such as reconstruction and contrastive learning. The model is trained to learn the spatiotemporal features of the area. It monitors the changes by comparing the latent feature distribution at each time stamp and generates change maps to reflect the changes in the area.&amp;#160;We also propose a framework for flood monitoring that continuously monitor the area using time series data. This framework automatically detects the change point i.e. when the major change started reflecting on available SAR data. Our continuous monitoring framework combined with a better temporal resolution (better than Sentinel-1) can potentially detect flood events in an early stage, allowing for more time for evacuation planning.&amp;#160;The model is evaluated on nine recent flood events from &amp;#8216;Mekong&amp;#8217;, &amp;#8216;Somalia&amp;#8217;, &amp;#8216;Scotland&amp;#8217;, &amp;#8216;Australia&amp;#8217;, &amp;#8216;Bosnia&amp;#8217;, &amp;#8216;Germany&amp;#8217;, &amp;#8216;Spain&amp;#8217;, &amp;#8216;Bolivia&amp;#8217;, and &amp;#8216;Slovakia&amp;#8217; sites. We compared our results with traditional methods, and existing supervised and unsupervised methods. Our detailed evaluation indicates that our model is more accurate and generalizable to new sites. The model achieves an average Intersection Over Union (IoU) value of 70% and an F1 score of 81.14%, which are both higher than the scores of the previous best-performing method. Overall, our proposed model&amp;#8217;s improvement range from 7-26% in terms of F1 and 8-31% in terms of IoU score.&amp;#160;","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu23-14375,"",,
rayyan-220248398,Comparability of Deep Learning Techniques for Calving Front Segmentation in SAR Imagery,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Monitoring glacier change processes leads to a better understanding of how glaciers respond to various external forcings. For sub-annual remote sensing, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery is indispensable, as polar night and cloud cover limit the temporal continuity of optical imagery. Especially with the launch of the Sentinel-1 mission, the availability of suitable SAR imagery has increased substantially. This high amount of data leads to another challenge: Manual inspection is no longer feasible. Therefore, in recent years, many studies applied deep learning to automate the segmentation of calving fronts in satellite imagery. To ensure comparability between different deep learning models, they must be trained and tested on the same data with a predefined test set and evaluated with the same metrics. A dataset intended to be used for this purpose is called a benchmark dataset and needs to provide the ready-to-use satellite imagery and the corresponding calving front labels. Gourmelon et al. [1] provide such a dataset for SAR imagery of calving fronts called CaFFe (https://doi.pangaea.de/10.1594/PANGAEA.940950). CaFFe includes multi-mission data (ERS-1/2, RADARSAT 1, Envisat, ALOS, Sentinel-1A/B, TerraSAR-X, and TanDEM-X), providing a spatial resolution between 6 and 20 meters and covering the period from 1996 to 2020. It contains images of seven glaciers from Antarctica to Greenland and Alaska. For each of the 681 images contained in the benchmark, two labels are provided: One displaying the calving front versus background and the other showing different zones (ocean, rock outcrops, glacier area, and no information available). CaFFe is split into a train set and a predefined out-of-sample test set, which comprises all images from two of the seven glaciers. A split of the train set into training and validation is not specified, as different approaches like cross-validation shall be possible. The benchmark covers a wide variety of different conditions to capture the variability of SAR calving front images. For example, images with open oceans and images with ice-melange-covered oceans are included in the dataset. Especially including images featuring ice-melange is of great importance, as deep learning models have shown difficulties in accurately segmenting calving fronts under this condition. Including images with ice-melange in the train set helps models to learn accurate predictions even under these circumstances. &amp;#160;Adding such images to the test set ensures that evaluated models are able to cope with ice melange. The test set of CaFFe is specifically designed to be challenging, such that the generalizability of models to different conditions and spatial transferability even to other continents can be verified. Gourmelon et al. provide baselines (one for each of the available labels) complementing the benchmark dataset. Current collaborative work aims to evaluate recently published deep learning techniques for calving front extraction on CaFFe and compare it with the baselines.[1] N. Gourmelon, T. Seehaus, M.

There is growing interest in the scientific community on the subject of microplastics. This chapter focuses on the global scenario of microplastics as persistent contaminants in the environment. Recent advances in multidisciplinary research on microplastics, including distribution in the aerosphere, hydrosphere, and soil, as well as the sources, fate, distribution, toxicity, and management of microplastics, are covered in this chapter. Most microplastics are generated on land and end up in the marine environment. This chapter reviews the status of single-use plastics and microplastics in the aerosphere, aquatic environment, soil systems, and food chain and web, along with treatment technologies and management aspects. Sampling methods and treatment and analytical techniques used to identify microplastics in the triad of the environment are covered. Microplastics in beach and marine environments, leaching and adsorption, and microplastics from landfills and industrial wastewaters are appraised in the hydrosphere. Additionally, the presence of microplastics in sewage sludge and soils irrigated with wastewater or fertilized with sludge, as well as the possible effects on plants and human health, are discussed. Necessary strategies, including valuable resources for environmental researchers, ecologists and toxicologists, policymakers, and non-experts, are also covered. Macro- and molecular-level interactions of microplastics with the human, animal, and environmental domains of the triad are highlighted.

rayyan-220248582,"Ecology of Lake Erie - Nutrients, microbes, algae, and dreissenid mussels: A synthesis",,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"The Lake Erie ecosystem, including its physical, chemical, and biological components, has changed considerably during recent decades owing to human-induced environmental stress (Fraker et al., 2022; Makarewicz and Bertram, 1991; Munawar and Munawar, 1976; Sinclair et al., 2021). While much has been learned from monitoring and research activities, a full understanding of how and why the ecosystem has changed is lacking (Fraker et al., 2023; Fussell et al., 2016; Sterner et al., 2017; Scavia et al., 2023), which has hampered the development of management strategies that can help sustain the integrity of the lake and its valued ecosystem services (e.g. clean water, safe recreation, food production). This AEHM special issue is the first of four focused on Lake Erie, all of which will aim to display the science being conducted to enhance ecosystem understanding and guide management decision-making.This special issue centers on watershed, nutrient, microbial (including cyanobacteria), algal, and dreissenid mussel dynamics, including their causes and consequences. Specifically, it focuses on understanding factors that have driven changes in: 1) nutrient loading and in-lake nutrient dynamics; 2) algal and cyanobacteria dynamics; and 3) dreissenid growth, impacts, and spatial variation. After recapping each paper's major messages and management implications, we offer some concluding remarks.Since the early 2000s, Lake Erie has shown signs of intensified eutrophication, including increases in the extent and duration of hypoxia and harmful algal blooms dominated by cyanobacteria (hereafter, cyanoHABs; Scavia et al., 2014; Watson et al., 2016). Some of those symptoms have been linked to altered nutrient dynamics in Lake Erie's watersheds and, particularly, significant increases in dissolved reactive phosphorus loads (Baker et al., 2014; Stumpf et al., 2016). The source of most phosphorus entering Lake Erie is agriculture (Wilson et al., 2018); however, this source is dispersed across the landscape (Kast et al., 2021) and difficult to mitigate. Thus, delineating the characteristics of watersheds that export the largest amount of nutrients is important to identifying locations where nutrient reduction will be most effective. While reducing nutrient input is critical, the behavior of nutrients once they have entered the lake is likely to influence where and when cyanoHABs occur. Toward improving our understanding of eutrophication, two of this AEHM special issue's contributors focused on identifying causes of variation in the dynamics of nutrient loading and approaches to model the availability of these loads on chemicophysical conditions.Johnson et al. (2023) sought to identify how watershed characteristics have influenced nutrient and sediment inputs into western Lake Erie. To this end, these authors used a suite of physical attributes, land uses, and point-source contributions to characterize seven tributary watersheds, six of which are Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement Annex 4 priority watersheds, and five sub-watersheds. The authors then used principal components regression analysis to determine their relationship with nutrient and sediment yields into Lake Erie. Briefly, their results demonstrated spatial (regional) variation in contributions of nutrients and sediments from each river during 2017-2021 that was related to watershed attributes. For example, nutrient inputs into Lake Erie from watersheds were positively related to the percentage of land supporting cultivated crops and poorly drained soils, with higher slopes and lower amounts of pasture being positively correlated with sediment yields. These authors then discussed their findings in the context of impending nutrient reductions aimed at mitigation of Lake Erie's recent re-eutrophication (Baker et al., 2019), explaining how consideration of regional differences in nutrient and sediment yields could benefit nutrient management planning.While Johnson et al. centered on factors that influence nutrient and sediment loading into Lake Erie, Bocaniov et al. (2023) focused how nutrient (total phosphorus, TP) inputs affect within-lake TP movement and distribution. These authors used an updated phosphorus mass-balance model (2003-2016) to derive TP load-response relationships and response matrices to predict steady-state lake TP concentrations as a function of variable external TP inputs. A key finding is that inter-basin transfer of TP plays a large role in driving basin-specific TP concentrations (e.g. inflow from the central basin contributes ∼70% of the resident TP in the eastern basin). Bocaniov et al.'s modeling also demonstrated that western Lake Erie is likely to respond quickly (93 days) to reduced TP inputs, with longer response times estimated in the central and eastern basins (540 and 303 days, respectively). These authors then discuss how their findings can help guide where in the watershed to manage nutrients and what timeframes may be needed before agencies can expect to see impacts of nutrient abatement efforts.An outcome of excessive agricultural nutrient loading into aquatic ecosystems is enhanced primary production. Lake Erie has experienced increases in benthic algae (e.g. Cladophora), pelagic algae, and cyanobacteria during both past (1960s-1970s) and more recent eutrophication events (Munawar and Munawar, 1996; O'Donnell et al., 2023; Vollenweider et al., 1974; Watson et al., 2016). Lake Erie is a large and complex ecosystem, however, and the specific type or location of algal blooms cannot be predicted by nutrient loading alone. Rather, how and where blooms form will depend on complex processes such as gazing pressure and nutrient availability within the lake, as well as water warming that will interact with high nutrient availability. With this backdrop, four papers in this AEHM special issue sought to enhance our ability to understand and describe the dynamics of primary producers, including algae and cyanobacteria.To help better understand the mechanisms responsible for benthic Cladophora outbreaks in eastern Lake Erie since dreissenid mussels colonized the lake, Depew et al. (2023) quantified the enzymatically hydrolysable portion (EHP) of dissolved organic phosphorus (DOP). Samples were collected during May through September 2019 at varying depths along the north shore of the eastern basin. These authors found that the EHP substantially contributed to the dissolved P pool, with this contribution averaging 53% of the total dissolved P and 63% of the DOP concentration. Hence, a large amount of DOP appears bioavailable owing to enzymatic hydrolysis. This result, combined with the fact that bioavailable DOP concentrations often exceeded dissolved reactive P concentrations, indicates an increased role of the benthic contributions to P bioavailability in the eastern basin since the establishment of dreissenid mussels. In turn, Depew et al. highlight the need to consider EHP when designing management strategies to control Cladophora outbreaks in the eastern basin.In contrast to Depew et al., Hoffman et al. (2023) quantified seasonal nitrification in Lake Erie's water column and explored its potential role in driving microbial dynamics, including cyanoHABs dominated by Microcystis spp. To do so, these authors used the stable isotope, 15NH4+, to track nitrification and qPCR to determine the relative abundances of ammonia oxidizing organisms (i.e. bacteria and Archaea, AOO) during 2015-2017. Hoffman et al. found that nitrification rates were lower during cyanoHABs, suggesting that AOOs were not good competitors with cyanobacteria for ammonia. These low rates can in part explain why cyanoHABs dominated by Microcystis spp. (non-nitrogen fixers) can persist despite low bioavailable nitrogen (N). Further, the removal of bioavailable N via coupled nitrification-denitrification is lower than the increase in bioavailable N through regeneration and external N loading. Using these findings, Hoffman et al. discuss the importance of reducing N loading into Lake Erie as a means to help reduce seasonal cyanoHABs.Hounshell et al. (2023) also focused on understanding cyanoHAB dynamics, exploring the role of P as a driver instead of N. While total bioavailable P (TBP) loading from the Maumee River (Ohio, USA) during spring has been shown to be a strong predictor of cyanoHAB severity in western Lake Erie (Baker et al., 2014; Bertani et al., 2016; Stumpf et al., 2016), much unexplained variation in cyanoHAB severity remains. Thus, Hounshell et al. (2023) sought to identify environmental variables that could improve the predictive relationship between the Maumee River spring TBP load and cyanoHAB severity. Their modeling showed that at both low (< 273 MTA) and high (> 332 MTA) TBP loads levels, no other environmental factors improved predictive accuracy of cyanoHABs in western Lake Erie. However, during years with intermediate springtime TBP loads (273-332 MTA), predictions of cyanoHABs could be improved by considering winter and July TBP loads, as well as ice extent and phenology. While their work is still ongoing, Hounshell et al.'s research highlights the value of both tributary and in-lake monitoring, as well as process-based modeling to cyanoHAB forecasting.Wang et al. (2023) also sought to use modeling to predict the distribution of cyanoHABs in Lake Erie. Specifically, these authors compared the performance of the one-dimensional (1D) Aquatic Ecosystem Dynamics–General Lake Model (AED–GLM) and the three-dimensional (3D) Aquatic Ecosystem Model (AEM3D–iWQ) in predicting cyanoHABs, phytoplankton biomass (as measured by chlorophyll a), and associated physicochemical conditions (e.g. water temperature, nutrients), among other things, in western Lake Erie during 2008 and 2011-2014. By qualitatively comparing their results to in situ observations, Wang et al. showed that the 3D model better reproduced seasonal and spatial variation in nutrients and phytoplankton with less error than the 1D model. Conversely, cyanoHABs were better predicted by the 1D model. As detailed in their paper, Wang et al. explain how the scale at which these models are calibrated can drive differences in model performance. These authors also discuss the implications of their findings for choosing the appropriate model to support management endeavors, including how to best calibrate them to achieve desired goals.The final set of papers centered on invasive dreissenid mussels, which have become a ubiquitous part of the Great Lakes since their introduction nearly four decades ago (Nalepa et al., 2005). Owing to their potential to negatively impact native mussels (Schloesser et al., 2006), zooplankton communities (Johannsson et al., 2000), phytoplankton biomass (Bocaniov et al., 2014), and nutrient cycling (Hecky et al., 2004), Zebra (Dreissena polymorpha) and Quagga (D. rostiformis bugensis) Mussels have garnered the interest of researchers and management agencies alike. Much of this effort has been devoted to understanding the mechanisms that influence dreissenid demographics and impacts of the food web, which are the focus of the last set of papers in this AEHM special issue.To understand the growth dynamics of dreissenid mussels and their impact on phytoplankton in western Lake Erie, Carter et al. (2023) combined field surveys, in situ growth experiments, and laboratory excretion and grazing experiments. Their results, which are important in interpreting two of the remaining AEHM special issue papers, showed that dreissenid communities have lower clearance rates and excretion rates compared to previously reported rates. This understanding, combined with reduced dreissenid densities in Lake Erie during recent decades, led Carter et al. to conclude that the ability of dreissenids to compound the effect of eutrophication that causes cyanoHABs may be less than previously thought (e.g. Vanderploeg et al., 2009; but see Carrick et al., 2023 and Vanderploeg et al., 2023). Carter et al. (2023) acknowledge, however, that the impact of dreissenids could be locally high at times, owing to their patchy distribution across the basin. In turn, these authors stress the need for frequent, fine-scale benthic surveys, which could improve ability to understand and forecast the impacts of dreissenids on the ecosystem.Carrick et al. (2023) also sought to quantify the impact of dreissenid mussels on plankton assemblages (heterotrophs and phototrophs) in western Lake Erie. Using controlled experiments conducted monthly during May through October 2018, these authors show that dreissenids graze actively throughout the growing season, consuming nano-sized heterotrophic and phototrophic plankton (e.g. phototrophic cryptophytes, centric diatoms, and non-pigmented chrysomonads). By contrast, lower clearance rates of cyanobacteria (e.g. Microcystis spp.), dinoflagellates, and some colonial chlorophytes were observed. Carrick et al. further suggest that selective dreissenid grazing on ""non-harmful"" plankton species in the nanoplankton size range, combined with lower grazing rates on larger cyanobacteria and chlorophyte species, could contribute to western Lake Erie's cyanoHAB problem. Notably, the small-scale experimental results of Carrick et al. contrast those from Carter et al.'s (2023) field-based study. This discrepancy highlights the value of both experimental and field-based approaches, as well as the need to carefully consider the spatiotemporal context of the investigation, when to quantifying the role of dreissenid grazing as a secondary promoter (above nutrient loading) of cyanoHABs.Vanderploeg et al. (2023) also used an experimental approach to quantity the impacts of dreissenid mussel grazing on the phytoplankton community. Their experiments showed that grazing pressure on phytoplankton varied during May through October, with grazing on cryptophytes and diatoms being high during late May through early July. Despite cyanophytes dominating the phytoplankton beginning in late July, dreissenid grazing on them was non-existent or low. Interestingly, 16S rRNA gene-sequencing analyses showed a diverse cyanobacteria community with Planktothrix dominating during the spring and Cyanobium dominating most of the summer through fall. By contrast, Microcystis, which is largely thought to dominate cyanoHABs in Lake Erie, only dominated during late June. Further, Microcystis was preferentially rejected by Quagga Mussels relative to other cyanobacteria. Using these findings, Vanderploeg et al. draw a similar conclusion as Carrick et al. (2023) by suggesting that dreissenid grazing can favor specific cyanobacteria such as Microcystis. Importantly, however, the final effect of dreissenid grazing as a secondary promoter of cyanoHABS depends on the population density of dreissenids, which is currently low (Carter et al., 2023).In this special issue's final paper, Elgin et al. (2023) conducted an in situ study to quantify spatial variation in colonization potential, growth rates, and abundance of dreissenid mussels at two sites with contrasting water-column conditions in western Lake Erie. Despite finding comparable dreissenid colonization potential and growth between study sites, both on and in the experimental cages, Elgin et al. found fewer mussels in the surrounding sediment at the site nearer the Maumee River. These authors use this finding to conclude that water-column conditions appear to favor dreissenid settlement and growth on hard surfaces suspended above the substrate across the western basin, but that conditions on or near the substrate may inhibit mussel settling and growth. Elgin et al. eventually discuss how substrate-driven bottlenecks could inform our understanding of dreissenid recruitment and distribution, as well as nutrient dynamics, in western Lake Erie. These authors also suggest how better characterization of substrate conditions could support dreissenid control efforts.Owing to the impact of humans, the world's ecosystems have been experiencing dramatic change, which has threatened their structure, function, and dynamics, as well as their capacity to support services valued by society. The world's Great Lakes are no exception with these ecosystems being degraded by numerous anthropogenic stressors, including nutrient alteration (both eutrophication and oligotrophication), non-native species invasions, habitat destruction, and climate change, among many others (Allan et al., 2013; Jenny, 2020; Odada et al., 2003). The magnitude, multitude, and simultaneous nature of these stressors have in turn challenged both researchers seeking to understand the dynamics of these ecosystems and agencies charged with managing the valued natural resources (e.g. fish, wildlife) and other services (e.g. safe drinking water, recreational opportunities) that these ecosystems provide (Allan et al., 2013; Odada and Olago, 2006; Sterner et al., 2017). Such challenges highlight the need for continued research aimed at understanding the causes and consequences of anthropogenic change.While all the large lakes of the world have been altered by anthropogenic stress, Lake Erie is among the most degraded. Its susceptibility to anthropogenic stress is largely due to its small size, shallow depth, high connectivity via shipping, and large watershed that supports both large cities and agricultural production (Fraker et al, 2022; Ludsin et al., 2001; Reutter, 2019). Most relevant to this AEHM special issue, Lake Erie has shifted trophic states multiple times in response to human impacts and subsequent mitigation efforts. Prior to the 1950s, Lake Erie was primarily in a pre-industrial state of mesotrophy-oligotrophy and shifted to a state of hypertrophy-mesotrophy during the 1960s-1970s. During the 1980s-1990s, it shifted back to more mesotrophic conditions in response to both mitigation efforts designed to reduce point-source inputs of TP and the invasion of dreissenid mussels. Most recently (post 2000), Lake Erie returned to a more eutrophic state due to non-point source runoff of dissolved reactive phosphorus (Kane et al., 2014; Ludsin et al., 2001; Sinclair et al., 2023; Vollenweider et al., 1974). Concomitantly, Lake Erie has currently been experiencing increases in the magnitude and extent of both bottom hypoxia and cyanoHABs (Scavia et al., 2014; Watson et al., 2016), which are threatening: human health through cyanotoxin exposure (e.g. Francy et al., 2016; Wituszynski et al., 2017); fish populations and the fisheries that they support (e.g. Stone et al., 2020; Wolf et al., 2017); and the regional economy through effects on tourism and property values (Smith et al., 2019; Wolf et al., 2022). These threats have increased the need for the science necessary to make informed management decisions (Fraker et al., 2023; Fussell et al., 2016; Sterner et al., 2017; Scavia et al., 2023), which includes describing the current state of the Lake Erie ecosystem and understanding the causal mechanisms of recent ecosystem change.The contributions to this AEHM special issue have provided new insights into the drivers of nutrient inputs, in-lake nutrient concentrations, benthic algae (Cladophora), planktonic heterotrophs, microbial autotrophs (including cyanobacteria responsible for cyanoHABs), algae (e.g. diatoms, cryptophytes), and dreissenid mussels. Further, each study has provided information that could benefit management, whether it be ecological understanding that could support ecosystem modeling (e.g. quantifying dreissenid distributions and their impacts on grazing rates and nutrient excretion; Carter et al., 2023; Elgin et al., 2023) or tools that could support nutrient management decision-making (e.g. Bocaniov et al., 2023; Johnson et al, 2023), cyanoHAB severity (e.g. Carrick et al.,. 2023; Hounshell et al., 2023; Vanderploeg et al., 2023) or chemicophysical conditions, including algal and cyanobacteria biomass (e.g. Depew et al., 2023; Hoffman et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023). While many additional messages can be found in the papers, collectively, three key conclusions can be made. First, findings from each of the three focal areas of this AEHM special issue highlight the need to consider fine spatial and/or temporal scales in both the watershed and the lake proper. Doing so offers a means to fully appreciate the complex array of processes driving the dynamics of Lake Erie's chemicophysical conditions and lower food web (e.g. primary producers, dreissenid mussels). Second, while the papers in this special issue showed the value of field-, laboratory-, and modeling-based research to describing, understanding, or predicting ecosystem conditions, they also pointed to challenges that can arise when integrating findings. For example, discrepancies can arise owing to studies being conducted in different settings (e.g. in the laboratory vs. in the field) or at different spatiotemporal scales (e.g. see Carrick et al., 2023; Carter et al., 2023; Vanderploeg et al., 2023). Finally, most papers demonstrated the need for continued and intensified monitoring (e.g. broader coverage at finer spatial and temporal scales), which will challenge agencies responsible for tracking ecosystem conditions. We expect, however, that continued improvement in our ability to cost-effectively monitor Lake Erie and its watershed via remote sensing technologies (Yang et al., 2022; Yin et al., 2021), combined with continually improving data-analytic approaches (e.g. machine and deep learning; Sun and Scanlon, 2019), will help agencies meet this challenge.While the research described in this AEHM special issue has addressed many knowledge gaps, many more remain. Our hope is that continued reporting of findings as part of this AEHM Ecology of Lake Erie series will increase our ability to understand and model the structure, function, and dynamics of the ecosystem. Such understanding and tools should facilitate our continued movement towards ecosystem-based management in the Great Lakes, which could help agencies rehabilitate the lake and sustainably manage its valued resources in the face of continued anthropogenic stress.We thank Ken Minns for providing helpful feedback on a previous version of this synthesis.","",https://doi.org/10.14321/aehm.026.04.131,"",,
rayyan-220249615,Parameterizing ocean vertical mixing using deep learning trained from high-resolution simulations,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Ocean vertical mixing plays a fundamental role in phenomena such as upwelling of nutrient-rich deep waters, and is crucial for determining net primary productivity in the ocean [1]. Simulating vertical mixing requires careful consideration and ingenuity for stable execution, as vertical mixing is often turbulent. Direct Numerical Simulations, in which the Navier-Stokes equations are solved without a turbulence model, are not realistic due to the enormous computational complexity. Ocean General Circulation Models (OGCMs) have low resolution and cannot directly resolve small-scale turbulence such as vertical mixing. Consequently, OGCMs based on the Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes equations use turbulence parameterizations to model the effect of unresolved motions on the mean flow [2]. Although K-Profile Parameterization (KPP) is widely recognized as a method for parameterizing vertical mixing [3], recent advancements in machine learning have triggered active exploration of data-driven approaches to parameterization [4, 5]. This study aims to develop a novel vertical mixing parameterization method using deep learning. High-resolution simulation results (O(103) m) are used as training data for a neural network to estimate vertical diffusion and viscosity. These estimates are then used to parameterize fine-scale dynamics in a low-resolution simulation (O(104) m). The input parameters of the neural network are the state variables RL = (vL, &amp;#952;L, SL)T, where vL is the flow velocity field, &amp;#952;L is the potential temperature, and SL is the salinity. Here, the L and H subscripts will be used to indicate the low and high-resolution simulations. The output parameters are P = (&amp;#954;h, Ah)T, where &amp;#954;h and Ah are the estimated vertical diffusion and viscosities respectively. The loss function is defined as the mean squared error between the state variables of the high and low-resolution simulations RL&amp;#8722;RH. Verification experiments for the proposed parameterization method are conducted for an idealized double-gyre configuration, which models western boundary currents such as the Gulf Stream in the North Atlantic Ocean. We confirm the performance and efficiency of the proposed method compared to traditional KPP for conducting high-resolution simulations at low computational cost.

Remote sensing from air and space has been the primary method in which changes are assessed within these important, often remote, ecosystems at a global scale. However, such global datasets often suffer from large spectral variances due to the time of observation, atmospheric effects, water column properties, and heterogeneous instruments and calibrations. To address these challenges, we developed an object-based fully convolutional network (FCN) to improve upon the spatial-spectral classification problem inherent in multimodal datasets. We showed that with training upon augmented data in conjunction with classical methods, such as K-nearest neighbors, we were able to achieve better overall classification and segmentation results. This suggests FCNs are able to effectively identify the relative applicable spectral and spatial spaces within an image, whereas pixel-based classical methods excel at classification within those identified spaces. Our spectrally invariant results, based on minimally preprocessed WorldView-2 and Planet satellite imagery, show a total accuracy of approximately 85% and 80%, respectively, over nine classes when trained and tested upon a chain of Fijian islands imaged under highly variable day-to-day spectral inputs.","",https://doi.org/10.1109/jstars.2020.3018719,"",,

rayyan-220252176,A new satellite-derived dataset for marine aquaculture areas in the China's coastal region,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract. China has witnessed extensive development of the marine aquaculture industry over recent years. However, such rapid and disordered expansion posed risks to coastal environment, economic development, and biodiversity protection. This study aimed to produce an accurate national-scale marine aquaculture map at a spatial resolution of 16 m, using a proposed deep convolution neural networks (CNNs) based model and applied it to satellite data from China's GF-1 sensor in an end-to-end way. The analyses used homogeneous CNNs to extract high-dimensional features from the input imagery and preserve information at full resolution. Then, a hierarchical cascade architecture was followed to capture multi-scale features and contextual information. This hierarchical cascade homogeneous neural network (HCHNet) was found to achieve better classification performance than current state-of-the-art models (FCN-32s, Deeplab V2, U-Net, and HCNet). The resulting marine aquaculture area map has an overall classification accuracy &gt; 95 % (95.2 %–96.4, 95 % confidence interval). And marine aquaculture was found to cover a total area of ~1100 km2 (1096.8 km2–1110.6 km2, 95 % confidence interval) in China, of which more than 85 % are marine plant culture areas, with 87 % found in the Fujian, Shandong, Liaoning, and Jiangsu provinces. The results confirm the applicability and effectiveness of HCHNet when applied to GF-1 data, identifying notable spatial distributions of different marine aquaculture areas and supporting the sustainable management and ecological assessments of coastal resources at a national scale. The national-scale marine aquaculture map at 16 m spatial resolution is published in the Google Maps kmz File Format with georeferencing information at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3881612 (Fu et al., 2020).","",https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-2020-122,"",,

rayyan-220252868,Rapid lineage diversification of gray mangroves (Avicennia marina) driven by isolation in cryptic glacial refugia and extreme environmental conditions in the Arabian Peninsula ,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Running title: Evolution of Arabian mangrovesGuillermo Friis*, Edward G. Smith, Catherine E. Lovelock, Alejandra Ortega, Alyssa Marshell, Carlos M. Duarte, John A. Burt*Corresponding author: Center for Genomics and Systems Biology, New York University — Abu Dhabi, PO Box 129188, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates; Email: guillefriis@gmail.com; Tel: +97126286739. Summary· Plant systems occurring in ecologically heterogeneous and spatially discontinuous habitats provide an ideal opportunity to investigate the relative roles of neutral and selective factors in driving lineage diversification. Here, we analyzed fully sequenced genomes to study diversification mechanisms in the gray mangroves [Avicennia marina (Forssk.) Vierh.] of Arabia, where they occur at the edge of the species' range and are subject to variable, often extreme, environmental conditions. · We conducted population structure, phylogenomic and demographic analyses to reconstruct the evolutionary history of the species across Arabia. We also applied genotype-environment association methods to study adaptive mechanisms of lineage diversification. · Our analyses revealed marked genetic structure and highly supported clades among and within the seas surrounding the Arabian Peninsula. Inferred divergence times were consistent with recent periods of low marine connectivity during glacial periods, revealing the presence of (cryptic) glacial refugia in the Red Sea and the Persian/Arabian Gulf. Genetic‐environment association analyses revealed high levels of adaptive differentiation, and detected signs of multi-loci local adaptation driven by temperature extremes and hypersalinity. · These results support a process of rapid diversification resulting from the combined effects of historical factors and ecological selection, and reveal mangrove peripheral environments as relevant drivers of lineage diversity. IntroductionLineage diversification in plants involves both neutral and selective factors (Rieseberg & Willis, 2007), and elucidating their relative roles in the process of evolutionary divergence is essential to understand the mechanisms underlying the early stages of speciation (Coyne & Orr, 2004). Evolutionary divergence may result from the accumulation of genetic differences caused by drift in geographic isolation or isolation-by-distance (IBD, Wright, 1943; Wright, 1946), a mode of divergence driven by neutral factors (Mayr, 1954; Mayr, 1963). In turn, geographic variation in environmental conditions can result in divergent selection (Darwin, 1859; Coyne & Orr, 2004), the diversifying process that drives ecological speciation (Nosil, 2012). In ecological speciation models, reproductive barriers arise as a by-product of cumulative, ecologically adaptive changes (Mayr, 1947; Schluter, 2000; Rundle & Nosil, 2005) enabling genome‐wide differentiation at both neutral and selected loci (Nosil et al., 2008; Funk et al., 2011; Shafer & Wolf, 2013; Wang & Bradburd, 2014). Ecological speciation in geographic isolation is theoretically uncontroversial, and considered key in some of the most remarkable radiations in angiosperms (Baldwin & Sanderson, 1998; Hughes & Eastwood, 2006). However, whether environment-driven processes of lineage diversification commonly occur in nature in the absence of long-term isolation and reduced gene flow remains debated in evolution research (Butlin et al., 2008; Fitzpatrick et al., 2008; Papadopulos et al., 2011; Foote, 2018). The interactions between selection and the stochastic effects derived from processes such as founder events, bottlenecks and genetic drift also remain unclear, and difficult to assess in natural systems (Barton & Charlesworth, 1984; Kliber & Eckert, 2005; Crepet & Niklas, 2009).Plant systems occurring in the environmentally heterogeneous and often extreme habitats at species' range edges are suitable models to investigate questions related to lineage diversification. The environment at the edges of species' range tends to be stressful and spatially discontinuous, as well as temporally unstable (Lesica & Allendorf, 1995), frequently resulting in dynamic settings of multiple isolated populations subject to strong differential selection. The severe and stochastic character of peripheral environments is hypothesized to generate strong selective interplay between adaptation and neutral processes (Hardie & Hutchings, 2010), providing an ideal opportunity for speciation research. One such system is the gray mangrove populations of the Arabian Peninsula (Avicennia marina var. marina). The gray mangrove has the broadest distribution of any mangrove species (Spalding et al., 2010; Hogarth, 2015; Tomlinson, 2016), extending across the Indian Ocean and into the West Pacific as far as Japan and New Zealand (Fouda & AI-Muharrami, 1996; Sheppard et al., 2010; Spalding et al., 2010; Khalil, 2015). Gray mangroves present several morphological and physiological adaptations to their harsh intertidal habitat (Tomlinson, 2016), which makes them a compelling model for the study of functional genes and biological pathways involved in selection and stress tolerance in plants (Urashi et al., 2013; Xu et al., 2017). The Arabian Peninsula represents one of the northernmost edges of the species' distribution (Duke, 1991; Spalding et al., 2010; Tomlinson, 2016), as well as a stressful habitat characterized by extreme temperatures, aridity, and often extreme salinity, factors known to be limiting for mangrove growth (Ball, 1988; Sheppard et al., 1992; Lovelock et al., 2016). Arabian marine domains are also environmentally diverse both within, and among, the main water bodies bordering the peninsula, which define three main biogeographic regions: (i) the Red Sea, where the marine system presents opposing gradients of salinity and temperature, with the highest temperature and lowest salinity in the shallow southern basin, while the deeper northern basin has cooler temperatures but high salinity as a result of limited precipitation and high evaporation (Carvalho et al., 2019; Anton et al., 2020); (ii) the Persian/Arabian Gulf (referred to as 'PAG' hereafter) to the northeast of the Arabian Peninsula, where populations are subject to arid (<250 mm) to hyper-arid (<100 mm) rainfall regimes, and experience the widest range of air temperatures in the region throughout the year (Böer, 1997; Whitford & Duval, 2019); and (iii) the Arabian Sea (here including the Sea of Oman), which in contrast with former biogeographic regions, has normal oceanic salinity, and summer temperatures that are buffered by cold-water upwelling as a result of the Indian Ocean monsoon, resulting in more moderate environmental conditions (Claereboudt, 2019).The Arabian Peninsula has experienced large fluctuations in spatial and environmental conditions throughout glacio-eustatic cycles that largely impacted the biodiversity of the region, in particular for the enclosed water bodies of the Red Sea and the PAG (DiBattista et al., 2016a). Throughout the last 400,000 years the Red Sea has remained connected to the Indian Ocean, yet cross-sectional area along the Strait of Bab al Mandab that connects these water bodies was, at times of glacial maxima, as low as 2% of that today, resulting in major increases in salinity and temperature within the Red Sea as well as near-complete isolation at times (Lambeck et al., 2011). For several sustained periods during the last two glacial cycles, the minimum channel width connecting the Red Sea to the Arabian Sea was less than 4 km wide and remained narrow whenever the local sea levels were 50 meters below current levels (Lambeck et al., 2011). In contrast, models show that the PAG was nearly completely drained during the peak of the last glaciation until c.a. 14,000 years ago (Lambeck, 1996). A marine incursion into the southern PAG basin started approximately 12,500 years ago, extending towards the northern basin over the following millennia, with the present day PAG shorelines forming just 6,000 years ago (Lambeck, 1996). In contrast, as an open ocean habitat, the Arabian Sea coast has only experienced vertical migration of sea levels during these glacial periods, without geographic isolation.The combination of extreme environmental conditions, differential changes in habitat and dynamic barriers to gene flow makes the seas bordering the Arabian Peninsula one of the most variable marine environments in the world, with a high potential for speciation driven by both neutral and selective factors (DiBattista et al., 2016b). Although the phylogenetic relationships for varieties of A. marina and congeneric species have been reported for other regions (Duke et al., 1998; Nettel et al., 2008; Li et al., 2016), the extensive gray mangrove populations from the Arabian coasts have rarely been included in reported DNA sequence-based analyses (see Duke et al., 1998; Maguire et al., 2000; Li et al., 2016; Al-Qthanin & Alharbi, 2020). The specific drivers and molecular basis of local adaptation and lineage diversification in A. marina remain understudied both in Arabia and across its global distribution.Here, we used the Arabian gray mangrove complex to examine how extreme habitat conditions and heterogeneous spatial settings have shaped genetic diversity at the highly variable edge of the species' range using whole genome and georeferenced environmental data. First, we analyzed patterns of population structure and reconstructed the evolutionary and demographic history of the species in the Arabian Peninsula. Two general competing hypotheses about the evolutionary history of the Arabian mangroves were tested in this study: (i) mangroves from the Red Sea and PAG were extirpated during the glacial cycles of the Pleistocene, followed by a recolonization after the last glacial maximum (LGM); and (ii) mangroves remained within the enclosed seas in glacial refugia during glacial periods, and expanded once sea levels rose. Second, we studied patterns of adaptive variability applying genotype-environment association (GEA) analysis. We used redundancy analysis (RDA) combining environmental and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) data to survey the genome and jointly identify environmental variables and functional genes potentially involved in local adaptation and lineage divergence. Materials and MethodsPopulation samplingWe sampled a total of 200 Avicennia marina individuals from 19 sites across the Arabian Peninsula (var. marina, N = 190), and one site from Australia (var. australasica, N = 10) (Table 1, Fig. 1; Table S1, Supporting Information). Leaf tissue was collected from trees separated by at least 20 meters, and preserved in silica beads for up to ten days before extraction. Geographic coordinates for each tree were recorded. Genomic DNA was extracted from ground leaf tissue using the DNeasy 96 plant kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Genome resequencing and variant calling Illumina paired-end 150 bp libraries with insert size equal to 350 bp were prepared and sequenced in a Novaseq platform. Reads were mapped against a previously published reference genome for A. marina (Friis et al., 2020), SNP calling was carried out with the GATK Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK; McKenna et al., 2010). The resulting dataset consisted of 178 individuals (Table 1; Table S1, Supporting Information) and 15,702,886 biallelic SNPs with a per-individual average coverage of 16.8 and a missing data rate of 0.11. This dataset was further filtered and customized for downstream analyses (See details in Supporting Information).Population structure analyses To explore genome-wide signs of population structure in Arabian mangroves, we first generated a dataset of high quality, independent and putatively neutral SNPs, consisting of a data matrix of 143,900 variable sites and 170 samples (Table S2, Supporting Information). We conducted a principal components analysis (PCA) as implemented the R package SNPRelate (Zheng, 2012). We also examined patterns of population divergence using a sparse non-negative matrix factorization method (SNMF; Frichot et al., 2014). We ran the program five times per K value, with K ranging from 2 to 20. Similarity scores among runs and graphics were computed with CLUMPAK (Kopelman et al. 2015). To further explore patterns of geographic variation in Arabian mangroves, we tested for IBD using the neutral SNP dataset. We computed pairwise Nei's genetic distance values with the hierfstat R package (Goudet et al., 2015). By-sea, pairwise geographic distances were measured based geographic coordinates. A Mantel test was implemented, and significance was computed through 9,999 matrix permutations.Phylogenetic analysisA maximum likelihood phylogeny was produced using the program IQ-TREE (Nguyen et al., 2015). For this analysis, we applied the same filters than for population structure tests, yet retained the Brisbane population from Australia to be used as outgroup (SNP matrix = 29,433, N = 178; Table S2, Supporting Information). The ascertainment bias correction and the generalized time-reversible substitution model were implemented.Population and demographic history analysesWe performed model comparisons under the likelihood framework developed in fastSIMCOAL2 v2.6 (Excoffier et al., 2013) to estimate demographic parameters and date cladogenetic events among mangroves populations, and to test the competing hypotheses of colonization after the LGM versus isolation in glacial refugia in the enclosed seas around Arabia. Informed by the phylogenetic relationships (See results), three sets of models were independently analyzed for (i) the Red Sea, (ii) the PAG plus the Sea of Oman, and (iii) the entire Arabian Peninsula. Three populations were used as lineage representatives for each set of models. The Brisbane population was once again included to calibrate times of divergence, using a coalescence time with the Arabian lineages of 2.7 million years in all models (Li et al., 2016; He et al., 2019; He et al., 2020). Topologies and times of divergence tested in each set of models were analyzed under scenarios of 'strict isolation' and 'isolation with migration'. Overall, six, twelve and two models were compared for the Red Sea, the PAG and the entire Arabian Peninsula, respectively (Table S4, Fig. S1, Supporting Information). As input data we used the folded site frequency spectra (SFS) generated from resequencing data using easySFS (https://github.com/isaacovercast/easySFS). Details about fastSIMCOAL2 analyses, input data, model sketches and parameter files are provided in the Supporting Information.TreeMix v1.13 (Pickrell & Pritchard, 2012) was used to further model historical patterns of gene flow between mangrove populations. The corresponding SNP dataset was built applying the same filters as for the IQ-TREE phylogeny, with the exemption of linkage disequilibrium filters as it can be controlled for in the TreeMix command line (SNP matrix = 797,949; N = 178). We ran TreeMix for 0–15 migrations, grouping SNPs in blocks of 50. Migration edges were plotted until 99.8% of the variance in ancestry between populations was explained by the model (Pickrell & Pritchard, 2012). The consistency of migration edges was evaluated by running TreeMix with 50 total replicates for each added migration edge number using a different, randomly generated seed. Results from the seed that yielded the highest likelihood are reported.Candidate gene identification with genotype-environment association analysisWe used genotype-environment association (GEA) analysis to identify candidate genes evolving under specific environmental pressures, and to estimate their contribution to patterns of local adaptation in mangroves from the Arabian Peninsula. We applied a redundancy analysis approach (Van Den Wollenberg, 1977; Legendre & Legendre, 1998; Borcard et al., 2011) as implemented in the vegan R package (Oksanen et al., 2016). As explanatory variables, we used georeferenced environmental data extracted for the coordinates corresponding to the sampling sites and averaged over populations. The set of explanatory variables included maximum of sea surface salinity and minimum of sea surface temperature averaged over months from the MARSPEC database (Sbrocco & Barber, 2013)]; as well as isothermality and maximum air temperature of the warmest month from the WorldClim database (Hijmans et al., 2005; Fick & Hijmans, 2017)]. As response variables, we used population allele frequencies at each variant position from a dataset of 2,488,560 SNPs (N = 170; Table S2, Supporting Information).Two GEA analyses were implemented: a simple RDA to test for genotype-environment associations between allele frequencies and environmental predictors; and a partial redundancy analysis (pRDA), in which in addition, we controlled for population structure effects. Covariates accounting for population structure consisted of the first two PCs of a PCA based on the allele frequencies matrix after filtering out positions putatively under selection. Following the procedure described in Capblancq et al. (2018), we used the redundancy analyses to identify candidate SNP loci potentially involved in divergent selection, based on Mahalanobis distances estimated between each SNP and the center of the RDA space (Capblancq & Forester, 2021), and applying a p-value threshold < 0.01 with the Bonferroni correction for multiple testing. In addition, to explore differential association patterns of candidate loci at the individual level, we conducted a complementary RDA with the individual genotypes of the SNP outliers as response variables. The first two RDA axes were plotted for visual inspection, as well as pairwise Euclidean distances in the ordination space for all the populations included in the analysis. Further details on implemented GEA analyses and candidate gene identification are provided in the Supporting Information. ResultsPopulation structure and genetic diversity analysesA principal components analysis (PCA) revealed marked levels of population structure. A plot of the first two axes recovered a pattern of clustering that matched the geographic distribution of the sampled populations. Populations from the Red Sea and the PAG clustered apart, showing high overlapping within each biogeographic region. Populations along the coasts of the Arabian Sea also showed marked genetic structure: populations at the west (Salalah and Taqah) grouped together and apart from the remaining genetic clusters, while populations from the Sea of Oman at the east (Shinas and Qurm) clustered close to the PAG. The intermediate population of Filim occupied a central position along the PC2. The third and fourth axes revealed high levels of differentiation within biogeographic regions. Northern and southern basins of the PAG clustered apart along PC3, as well as populations from the Arabian Sea, yet to a lesser extent. Populations of the Red Sea differentiated along PC4 (Fig. 2A).A SNMF analysis recovered variability patterns consistent with the PCA results. At K = 2, populations clustered into two groups separating the Red Sea from the Arabian Sea and the PAG. The plot for K = 3 also revealed the more isolated, adjacent populations from the west of the Arabian Sea (Salalah and Taqah) as a differentiated group, with populations along the northeast Oman coast and into the PAG showing decreasing degrees of shared ancestry. At K = 4, populations from the northern basin of the PAG (Bahrain and Dammam) appeared as a differentiated cluster. At K = 5, populations from northern Red Sea (Duba, Al Wajh 1 and Al Wajh 2) also appeared as a genetically differentiated cluster, yet showing a signal of coancestry decreasing with latitude with proximal populations from the central Red Sea (Al Kharrar and King Abdullah Economic City, hereafter KAEC) and to a lesser extent, Al Lith. In the plot for K = 6, populations from the Sea of Oman, Qurm and Shinas, clustered together with Filim, yet Shinas showed intermediate levels of shared ancestry with the genetic cluster of the southern PAG basin, which included Ras Al Khaimah (hereafter RAK), Umm Al Quawain (hereafter UAQ), Ras Ghurab and Suweihat. At K = 7, populations from southern Red Sea (Al Lith, Farasan Banks 1 and Farasan Banks 2; hereafter FB1 and FB2) clustered apart from the central Red Sea populations, yet Al Lith presented intermediate levels of coancestry with the central Red Sea population KAEC (Fig. 2B).A Mantel test based on selectively neutral, independent SNP loci revealed a significant correlation between by-sea pairwise distances and Nei's genetic distances among sampled populations (r = 0.765, p-value < 10-4; Table S3, Supporting Information).Phylogenetic analysisA maximum likelihood phylogenetic reconstruction showed marked differentiation between and within biogeographic regions, with almost all populations resolved in monophyletic clades with high node support. Arabian mangrove populations grouped in three major, reciprocally monophyletic clades or phylogenetic lineages: the Red Sea lineage (Major Clade I), the southern Arabian Sea lineage (Major Clade II) and the PAG plus the Sea of Oman lineage (Major Clade III). Within the Red Sea's Major Clade I, the phylogenetic analysis revealed a sequence of cladogenetic events consistent with the geographic distribution of the sampled populations, with the first split separating northern (Duba, Al Wajh 1 and Al Wajh 2) and central populations (Al Kharrar and KAEC) from those of the south (Al Lith, FB1 and FB2); adjacent Al Kharrar and KAEC populations from central Red Sea showed little differentiation and grouped into a single clade. The Arabian Sea's Major Clade II encompassed the populations Salalah, Taqah and Filim, all occurring in southern Oman, which appeared as the sister group of the Major Clade III, which includes all Sea of Oman and PAG populations. Major Clade III was further divided into two clades separating the populations of the northern basin of the PAG (Bahrain and Dammam) from those of the southern basin (RAK, UAQ, Ras Ghurab and Suweihat) and the Sea of Oman (Qurm and Shinas). Populations of these two latter subregions, which occur on each side of the Strait of Hormuz, appeared as reciprocally monophyletic, sister groups (Fig. 3).Population and demographic history of the Arabian gray mangroveDemographic models were compared under fastSIMCOAL2. In the Red Sea, the model with the greatest likelihood score (ΔAIC = 318, Fig. 4; Table S4, Supporting Information) revealed a single cladogenetic event for the three analyzed populations under an isolation with migration scenario, and a splitting time dating back to 99,200 years (95% CI = [40,062 – 295,152]), consistent with a process of rapid, simultaneous lineage differentiation. Gene exchange among lineages was particularly high from Al Kharrar in the central Red Sea towards Farasan Banks 2 towards the southern entrance (MIG Al Kharrar → FB2 = 60, 95% CI = [13 – 109] migrants per generation). For the remaining migration bands, 95% confidence intervals varied by orders of magnitude and included values near to zero, revealing little impact of these parameters in the SFS (Fig. 4; Table S5, Supporting Information). In the case of the PAG plus the Sea of Oman, the model that best fitted our data (ΔAIC = 1,615, Fig. 4; Table S4, Supporting Information) also revealed a scenario of simultaneous cladogenesis in isolation with migration dating back 37,760 years (95% CI = [18,950-161,565]), prior to the last glacial maximum. Signs of some gene flow were detected among PAG lineages. While narrower than in the Red Sea estimates, the ranges also included values near to zero in most cases, reducing the certainty in the model (Fig. 4; Table S5, Supporting Information). In the analysis with representatives of each biogeographic region of the Arabian Peninsula, the highest likelihood corresponded once again to the model including migration (ΔAIC = 1,067, Fig. 4; Table S4, Supporting Information), and revealed splitting times of 70,180 years (95% CI = [14,074-161,976]) and 153,140 years (95% CI = [90,714-416,863]) (Fig. 4; Table S5, Supporting Information).Phylogenetic relationships recovered with TreeMix were consistent with the maximum likelihood tree generated with IQ-TREE. A tree model with ten migration events explained up to 99.8% of the SNP variance, revealing signs of both historical and contemporary gene flow among mangrove populations. Two recovered bands of ancestral migration between the outgroup lineage of Brisbane and the northern populations of both the Red Sea and the PAG seemed highly unlikely, so that these results should be interpreted with caution (Fig. 5).Candidate genes and environmental adaptation patterns in Arabian gray mangrovesEnvironmental predictors explained 33.2% of the total genetic variance in the simple RDA (Adjusted R2 = 0.332, p-value < 0.01). The scores of the simple RDA revealed distinct association patterns among biogeographic regions. Red Sea mangroves showed high, negative loading values on RDA axis (RD) 1, while the remaining populations correlated positively with this axis, and heavily in the case of the Sea of Oman and PAG southern basin. In contrast, the Arabian Sea populations showed high negative association values with RD2, while Red Sea and PAG mangroves showed positive association scores along this axis, yet the former with much lower correlation values. In the pRDA, environmental variables explained 6.4%of the total genetic variance after controlling for population structure (Adjusted R2 = 0.064, p-value < 0.01). Scores revealed a more scattered pattern of variation among and within biogeographic regions, where populations from northern PAG showed high positive correlation with pRD1, while populations of the southern PAG and Arabian Sea, as well as from Central Red Sea, showed more limited, negative loading values. In the case of the pRD2, highest loading values corresponded to Qurm, with a positive correlation, and to Ras Ghurab and Suweihat, that correlated negatively (Table S6, Supporting Information).The simple and the partial RDA were jointly used to test for signs of selection applying the method described in Capblancq et al. (2018). The first to axes of the simple RDA accounted for an unadjusted proportion of explained variance equal to 38.8% (R2 = 0.388) out of 48.0% explained by the full model. In turn, the four axes of the partial RDA accounted for 32.3% (R2 = 0.323). Two and four RDA axes from the simple and partial RDA, respectively, were thereby used for candidate loci identification. The analyses revealed 446 genetic variants showing significant associations with one or more of the four environmental predictors in both the RDA and pRDA (NRDA = 3,015; NpRDA = 73,671; Njoint = 446; Fig. S2, Supporting Information). Of the 446 outliers, 70 were located within 31 functionally annotated genes. Reported functions of the identified genes and gene variants in flowering plants potentially relevant for mangroves in this marginal Arabian environment include the following: tolerance to chronic heat stress (MGE2; Hu et al., 2012); drought resistance by stomatal aperture and density regulation, as well as root development (ABIL2; Li et al., 2015); root hydrotropism and drought tolerance; water transport and osmotic pressure control in response to drought and salt stress (PIP; Katsuhara & Hanba, 2008; Mahdieh et al., 2008; Rodríguez-Gamir et al., 2011); cell wall biosynthesis and development (BXL2; Goujon et al., 2003; Zhao et al., 2010); organ growth adjustments in response to stress conditions (MOB1A; Pinosa et al., 2013); Nitrogen uptake and coordination against biotic stress (WRK50; Cheng et al., 2021); response to salinity stress (SQS2; Shirazi et al., 2019); drought tolerance and regulation of reactive oxygen species through sterol biosynthesis (SQE2; Posé et al., 2009); terpenoid metabolism in response to drought stress (4CLL7; Madritsch et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2022); flower bud differentiation in response to light (AI5L5; Yi et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2022); and salt sensitivity in association with the ABA signaling pathway (PUM23; Huang et al., 2018) (Table S7, Supporting Information).To visually explore how adaptive variability is structured at the individual level, we conducted a complementary redundancy analysis based on the individual genotypes of the 446 candidate loci alone. The plot of the first two RDA axes revealed distinctive associations patterns only partially structured by biogeographic region: Populations from the Red Sea differentiated along a gradient loading on maximum air temperature, with northern populations (Duba, Al Wajh 1 and Al Wajh 2) showing high negative correlation values, central Red Sea (Al Lith, FB1 and FB2) clustering close to the origin of coordinates, and southern Red Sea showing positive correlations. Populations from the southwest of the Arabian Sea (Taqah and Salalah) showed a strong, positive GEA signal with isothermality, while correlated negatively with a maximum salinity gradient. In contrast, populations from the Sea of Oman presented low association values and clustered around the origin of coordinates. Populations from the PAG showed an opposite GEA pattern to those of the Arabian Sea, also differentiating along the salinity/isothermality gradient, yet associations were weaker and more scattered in the southern basin than in the northern one (Fig. 6A). Individual Euclidean distances averaged over populations in the RDA ordination space showed general similar trends (Fig. 6B), with within-region, highest differences among association patterns occurring along the Red Sea and outrunning divergence between biogeographic regions (Fig. 6B).

Summary· Plant systems occurring in ecologically heterogeneous and spatially discontinuous habitats provide an ideal opportunity to investigate the relative roles of neutral and selective factors in driving lineage diversification. Here, we analyzed fully sequenced genomes to study diversification mechanisms in the gray mangroves [Avicennia marina (Forssk.) Vierh.] of Arabia, where they occur at the edge of the species’ range and are subject to variable, often extreme, environmental conditions. · We conducted population structure, phylogenomic and demographic analyses to reconstruct the evolutionary history of the species across Arabia. We also applied genotype-environment association methods to study adaptive mechanisms of lineage diversification. · Our analyses revealed marked genetic structure and highly supported clades among and within the seas surrounding the Arabian Peninsula. Inferred divergence times were consistent with recent periods of low marine connectivity during glacial periods, revealing the presence of (cryptic) glacial refugia in the Red Sea and the Persian/Arabian Gulf. Genetic‐environment association analyses revealed high levels of adaptive differentiation, and detected signs of multi-loci local adaptation driven by temperature extremes and hypersalinity. · These results support a process of rapid diversification resulting from the combined effects of historical factors and ecological selection, and reveal mangrove peripheral environments as relevant drivers of lineage diversity. IntroductionLineage diversification in plants involves both neutral and selective factors (Rieseberg & Willis, 2007), and elucidating their relative roles in the process of evolutionary divergence is essential to understand the mechanisms underlying the early stages of speciation (Coyne & Orr, 2004). Evolutionary divergence may result from the accumulation of genetic differences caused by drift in geographic isolation or isolation-by-distance (IBD, Wright, 1943; Wright, 1946), a mode of divergence driven by neutral factors (Mayr, 1954; Mayr, 1963). In turn, geographic variation in environmental conditions can result in divergent selection (Darwin, 1859; Coyne & Orr, 2004), the diversifying process that drives ecological speciation (Nosil, 2012). In ecological speciation models, reproductive barriers arise as a by-product of cumulative, ecologically adaptive changes (Mayr, 1947; Schluter, 2000; Rundle & Nosil, 2005) enabling genome‐wide differentiation at both neutral and selected loci (Nosil et al., 2008; Funk et al., 2011; Shafer & Wolf, 2013; Wang & Bradburd, 2014). Ecological speciation in geographic isolation is theoretically uncontroversial, and considered key in some of the most remarkable radiations in angiosperms (Baldwin & Sanderson, 1998; Hughes & Eastwood, 2006). However, whether environment-driven processes of lineage diversification commonly occur in nature in the absence of long-term isolation and reduced gene flow remains debated in evolution research (Butlin et al., 2008; Fitzpatrick et al., 2008; Papadopulos et al., 2011; Foote, 2018). The interactions between selection and the stochastic effects derived from processes such as founder events, bottlenecks and genetic drift also remain unclear, and difficult to assess in natural systems (Barton & Charlesworth, 1984; Kliber & Eckert, 2005; Crepet & Niklas, 2009).Plant systems occurring in the environmentally heterogeneous and often extreme habitats at species’ range edges are suitable models to investigate questions related to lineage diversification. The environment at the edges of species’ range tends to be stressful and spatially discontinuous, as well as temporally unstable (Lesica & Allendorf, 1995), frequently resulting in dynamic settings of multiple isolated populations subject to strong differential selection. The severe and stochastic character of peripheral environments is hypothesized to generate strong selective interplay between adaptation and neutral processes (Hardie & Hutchings, 2010), providing an ideal opportunity for speciation research. One such system is the gray mangrove populations of the Arabian Peninsula (Avicennia marina var. marina). The gray mangrove has the broadest distribution of any mangrove species (Spalding et al., 2010; Hogarth, 2015; Tomlinson, 2016), extending across the Indian Ocean and into the West Pacific as far as Japan and New Zealand (Fouda & AI-Muharrami, 1996; Sheppard et al., 2010; Spalding et al., 2010; Khalil, 2015). Gray mangroves present several morphological and physiological adaptations to their harsh intertidal habitat (Tomlinson, 2016), which makes them a compelling model for the study of functional genes and biological pathways involved in selection and stress tolerance in plants (Urashi et al., 2013; Xu et al., 2017). The Arabian Peninsula represents one of the northernmost edges of the species’ distribution (Duke, 1991; Spalding et al., 2010; Tomlinson, 2016), as well as a stressful habitat characterized by extreme temperatures, aridity, and often extreme salinity, factors known to be limiting for mangrove growth (Ball, 1988; Sheppard et al., 1992; Lovelock et al., 2016). Arabian marine domains are also environmentally diverse both within, and among, the main water bodies bordering the peninsula, which define three main biogeographic regions: (i) the Red Sea, where the marine system presents opposing gradients of salinity and temperature, with the highest temperature and lowest salinity in the shallow southern basin, while the deeper northern basin has cooler temperatures but high salinity as a result of limited precipitation and high evaporation (Carvalho et al., 2019; Anton et al., 2020); (ii) the Persian/Arabian Gulf (referred to as ‘PAG’ hereafter) to the northeast of the Arabian Peninsula, where populations are subject to arid (<250 mm) to hyper-arid (<100 mm) rainfall regimes, and experience the widest range of air temperatures in the region throughout the year (Böer, 1997; Whitford & Duval, 2019); and (iii) the Arabian Sea (here including the Sea of Oman), which in contrast with former biogeographic regions, has normal oceanic salinity, and summer temperatures that are buffered by cold-water upwelling as a result of the Indian Ocean monsoon, resulting in more moderate environmental conditions (Claereboudt, 2019).The Arabian Peninsula has experienced large fluctuations in spatial and environmental conditions throughout glacio-eustatic cycles that largely impacted the biodiversity of the region, in particular for the enclosed water bodies of the Red Sea and the PAG (DiBattista et al., 2016a). Throughout the last 400,000 years the Red Sea has remained connected to the Indian Ocean, yet cross-sectional area along the Strait of Bab al Mandab that connects these water bodies was, at times of glacial maxima, as low as 2% of that today, resulting in major increases in salinity and temperature within the Red Sea as well as near-complete isolation at times (Lambeck et al., 2011). For several sustained periods during the last two glacial cycles, the minimum channel width connecting the Red Sea to the Arabian Sea was less than 4 km wide and remained narrow whenever the local sea levels were 50 meters below current levels (Lambeck et al., 2011). In contrast, models show that the PAG was nearly completely drained during the peak of the last glaciation until c.a. 14,000 years ago (Lambeck, 1996). A marine incursion into the southern PAG basin started approximately 12,500 years ago, extending towards the northern basin over the following millennia, with the present day PAG shorelines forming just 6,000 years ago (Lambeck, 1996). In contrast, as an open ocean habitat, the Arabian Sea coast has only experienced vertical migration of sea levels during these glacial periods, without geographic isolation.The combination of extreme environmental conditions, differential changes in habitat and dynamic barriers to gene flow makes the seas bordering the Arabian Peninsula one of the most variable marine environments in the world, with a high potential for speciation driven by both neutral and selective factors (DiBattista et al., 2016b). Although the phylogenetic relationships for varieties of A. marina and congeneric species have been reported for other regions (Duke et al., 1998; Nettel et al., 2008; Li et al., 2016), the extensive gray mangrove populations from the Arabian coasts have rarely been included in reported DNA sequence-based analyses (see Duke et al., 1998; Maguire et al., 2000; Li et al., 2016; Al-Qthanin & Alharbi, 2020). The specific drivers and molecular basis of local adaptation and lineage diversification in A. marina remain understudied both in Arabia and across its global distribution.Here, we used the Arabian gray mangrove complex to examine how extreme habitat conditions and heterogeneous spatial settings have shaped genetic diversity at the highly variable edge of the species’ range using whole genome and georeferenced environmental data. First, we analyzed patterns of population structure and reconstructed the evolutionary and demographic history of the species in the Arabian Peninsula. Two general competing hypotheses about the evolutionary history of the Arabian mangroves were tested in this study: (i) mangroves from the Red Sea and PAG were extirpated during the glacial cycles of the Pleistocene, followed by a recolonization after the last glacial maximum (LGM); and (ii) mangroves remained within the enclosed seas in glacial refugia during glacial periods, and expanded once sea levels rose. Second, we studied patterns of adaptive variability applying genotype-environment association (GEA) analysis. We used redundancy analysis (RDA) combining environmental and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) data to survey the genome and jointly identify environmental variables and functional genes potentially involved in local adaptation and lineage divergence. Materials and MethodsPopulation samplingWe sampled a total of 200 Avicennia marina individuals from 19 sites across the Arabian Peninsula (var. marina, N = 190), and one site from Australia (var. australasica, N = 10) (Table 1, Fig. 1; Table S1, Supporting Information). Leaf tissue was collected from trees separated by at least 20 meters, and preserved in silica beads for up to ten days before extraction. Geographic coordinates for each tree were recorded. Genomic DNA was extracted from ground leaf tissue using the DNeasy 96 plant kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Genome resequencing and variant calling Illumina paired-end 150 bp libraries with insert size equal to 350 bp were prepared and sequenced in a Novaseq platform. Reads were mapped against a previously published reference genome for A. marina (Friis et al., 2020), SNP calling was carried out with the GATK Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK; McKenna et al., 2010). The resulting dataset consisted of 178 individuals (Table 1; Table S1, Supporting Information) and 15,702,886 biallelic SNPs with a per-individual average coverage of 16.8 and a missing data rate of 0.11. This dataset was further filtered and customized for downstream analyses (See details in Supporting Information).Population structure analyses To explore genome-wide signs of population structure in Arabian mangroves, we first generated a dataset of high quality, independent and putatively neutral SNPs, consisting of a data matrix of 143,900 variable sites and 170 samples (Table S2, Supporting Information). We conducted a principal components analysis (PCA) as implemented the R package SNPRelate (Zheng, 2012). We also examined patterns of population divergence using a sparse non-negative matrix factorization method (SNMF; Frichot et al., 2014). We ran the program five times per K value, with K ranging from 2 to 20. Similarity scores among runs and graphics were computed with CLUMPAK (Kopelman et al. 2015). To further explore patterns of geographic variation in Arabian mangroves, we tested for IBD using the neutral SNP dataset. We computed pairwise Nei’s genetic distance values with the hierfstat R package (Goudet et al., 2015). By-sea, pairwise geographic distances were measured based geographic coordinates. A Mantel test was implemented, and significance was computed through 9,999 matrix permutations.Phylogenetic analysisA maximum likelihood phylogeny was produced using the program IQ-TREE (Nguyen et al., 2015). For this analysis, we applied the same filters than for population structure tests, yet retained the Brisbane population from Australia to be used as outgroup (SNP matrix = 29,433, N = 178; Table S2, Supporting Information). The ascertainment bias correction and the generalized time-reversible substitution model were implemented.Population and demographic history analysesWe performed model comparisons under the likelihood framework developed in fastSIMCOAL2 v2.6 (Excoffier et al., 2013) to estimate demographic parameters and date cladogenetic events among mangroves populations, and to test the competing hypotheses of colonization after the LGM versus isolation in glacial refugia in the enclosed seas around Arabia. Informed by the phylogenetic relationships (See results), three sets of models were independently analyzed for (i) the Red Sea, (ii) the PAG plus the Sea of Oman, and (iii) the entire Arabian Peninsula. Three populations were used as lineage representatives for each set of models. The Brisbane population was once again included to calibrate times of divergence, using a coalescence time with the Arabian lineages of 2.7 million years in all models (Li et al., 2016; He et al., 2019; He et al., 2020). Topologies and times of divergence tested in each set of models were analyzed under scenarios of ‘strict isolation’ and ‘isolation with migration’. Overall, six, twelve and two models were compared for the Red Sea, the PAG and the entire Arabian Peninsula, respectively (Table S4, Fig. S1, Supporting Information). As input data we used the folded site frequency spectra (SFS) generated from resequencing data using easySFS (https://github.com/isaacovercast/easySFS). Details about fastSIMCOAL2 analyses, input data, model sketches and parameter files are provided in the Supporting Information.TreeMix v1.13 (Pickrell & Pritchard, 2012) was used to further model historical patterns of gene flow between mangrove populations. The corresponding SNP dataset was built applying the same filters as for the IQ-TREE phylogeny, with the exemption of linkage disequilibrium filters as it can be controlled for in the TreeMix command line (SNP matrix = 797,949; N = 178). We ran TreeMix for 0–15 migrations, grouping SNPs in blocks of 50. Migration edges were plotted until 99.8% of the variance in ancestry between populations was explained by the model (Pickrell & Pritchard, 2012). The consistency of migration edges was evaluated by running TreeMix with 50 total replicates for each added migration edge number using a different, randomly generated seed. Results from the seed that yielded the highest likelihood are reported.Candidate gene identification with genotype-environment association analysisWe used genotype-environment association (GEA) analysis to identify candidate genes evolving under specific environmental pressures, and to estimate their contribution to patterns of local adaptation in mangroves from the Arabian Peninsula. We applied a redundancy analysis approach (Van Den Wollenberg, 1977; Legendre & Legendre, 1998; Borcard et al., 2011) as implemented in the vegan R package (Oksanen et al., 2016). As explanatory variables, we used georeferenced environmental data extracted for the coordinates corresponding to the sampling sites and averaged over populations. The set of explanatory variables included maximum of sea surface salinity and minimum of sea surface temperature averaged over months from the MARSPEC database (Sbrocco & Barber, 2013)]; as well as isothermality and maximum air temperature of the warmest month from the WorldClim database (Hijmans et al., 2005; Fick & Hijmans, 2017)]. As response variables, we used population allele frequencies at each variant position from a dataset of 2,488,560 SNPs (N = 170; Table S2, Supporting Information).Two GEA analyses were implemented: a simple RDA to test for genotype-environment associations between allele frequencies and environmental predictors; and a partial redundancy analysis (pRDA), in which in addition, we controlled for population structure effects. Covariates accounting for population structure consisted of the first two PCs of a PCA based on the allele frequencies matrix after filtering out positions putatively under selection. Following the procedure described in Capblancq et al. (2018), we used the redundancy analyses to identify candidate SNP loci potentially involved in divergent selection, based on Mahalanobis distances estimated between each SNP and the center of the RDA space (Capblancq & Forester, 2021), and applying a p-value threshold < 0.01 with the Bonferroni correction for multiple testing. In addition, to explore differential association patterns of candidate loci at the individual level, we conducted a complementary RDA with the individual genotypes of the SNP outliers as response variables. The first two RDA axes were plotted for visual inspection, as well as pairwise Euclidean distances in the ordination space for all the populations included in the analysis. Further details on implemented GEA analyses and candidate gene identification are provided in the Supporting Information. ResultsPopulation structure and genetic diversity analysesA principal components analysis (PCA) revealed marked levels of population structure. A plot of the first two axes recovered a pattern of clustering that matched the geographic distribution of the sampled populations. Populations from the Red Sea and the PAG clustered apart, showing high overlapping within each biogeographic region. Populations along the coasts of the Arabian Sea also showed marked genetic structure: populations at the west (Salalah and Taqah) grouped together and apart from the remaining genetic clusters, while populations from the Sea of Oman at the east (Shinas and Qurm) clustered close to the PAG. The intermediate population of Filim occupied a central position along the PC2. The third and fourth axes revealed high levels of differentiation within biogeographic regions. Northern and southern basins of the PAG clustered apart along PC3, as well as populations from the Arabian Sea, yet to a lesser extent. Populations of the Red Sea differentiated along PC4 (Fig. 2A).A SNMF analysis recovered variability patterns consistent with the PCA results. At K = 2, populations clustered into two groups separating the Red Sea from the Arabian Sea and the PAG. The plot for K = 3 also revealed the more isolated, adjacent populations from the west of the Arabian Sea (Salalah and Taqah) as a differentiated group, with populations along the northeast Oman coast and into the PAG showing decreasing degrees of shared ancestry. At K = 4, populations from the northern basin of the PAG (Bahrain and Dammam) appeared as a differentiated cluster. At K = 5, populations from northern Red Sea (Duba, Al Wajh 1 and Al Wajh 2) also appeared as a genetically differentiated cluster, yet showing a signal of coancestry decreasing with latitude with proximal populations from the central Red Sea (Al Kharrar and King Abdullah Economic City, hereafter KAEC) and to a lesser extent, Al Lith. In the plot for K = 6, populations from the Sea of Oman, Qurm and Shinas, clustered together with Filim, yet Shinas showed intermediate levels of shared ancestry with the genetic cluster of the southern PAG basin, which included Ras Al Khaimah (hereafter RAK), Umm Al Quawain (hereafter UAQ), Ras Ghurab and Suweihat. At K = 7, populations from southern Red Sea (Al Lith, Farasan Banks 1 and Farasan Banks 2; hereafter FB1 and FB2) clustered apart from the central Red Sea populations, yet Al Lith presented intermediate levels of coancestry with the central Red Sea population KAEC (Fig. 2B).A Mantel test based on selectively neutral, independent SNP loci revealed a significant correlation between by-sea pairwise distances and Nei’s genetic distances among sampled populations (r = 0.765, p-value < 10-4; Table S3, Supporting Information).Phylogenetic analysisA maximum likelihood phylogenetic reconstruction showed marked differentiation between and within biogeographic regions, with almost all populations resolved in monophyletic clades with high node support. Arabian mangrove populations grouped in three major, reciprocally monophyletic clades or phylogenetic lineages: the Red Sea lineage (Major Clade I), the southern Arabian Sea lineage (Major Clade II) and the PAG plus the Sea of Oman lineage (Major Clade III). Within the Red Sea’s Major Clade I, the phylogenetic analysis revealed a sequence of cladogenetic events consistent with the geographic distribution of the sampled populations, with the first split separating northern (Duba, Al Wajh 1 and Al Wajh 2) and central populations (Al Kharrar and KAEC) from those of the south (Al Lith, FB1 and FB2); adjacent Al Kharrar and KAEC populations from central Red Sea showed little differentiation and grouped into a single clade. The Arabian Sea’s Major Clade II encompassed the populations Salalah, Taqah and Filim, all occurring in southern Oman, which appeared as the sister group of the Major Clade III, which includes all Sea of Oman and PAG populations. Major Clade III was further divided into two clades separating the populations of the northern basin of the PAG (Bahrain and Dammam) from those of the southern basin (RAK, UAQ, Ras Ghurab and Suweihat) and the Sea of Oman (Qurm and Shinas). Populations of these two latter subregions, which occur on each side of the Strait of Hormuz, appeared as reciprocally monophyletic, sister groups (Fig. 3).Population and demographic history of the Arabian gray mangroveDemographic models were compared under fastSIMCOAL2. In the Red Sea, the model with the greatest likelihood score (ΔAIC = 318, Fig. 4; Table S4, Supporting Information) revealed a single cladogenetic event for the three analyzed populations under an isolation with migration scenario, and a splitting time dating back to 99,200 years (95% CI = [40,062 – 295,152]), consistent with a process of rapid, simultaneous lineage differentiation. Gene exchange among lineages was particularly high from Al Kharrar in the central Red Sea towards Farasan Banks 2 towards the southern entrance (MIG Al Kharrar → FB2 = 60, 95% CI = [13 – 109] migrants per generation). For the remaining migration bands, 95% confidence intervals varied by orders of magnitude and included values near to zero, revealing little impact of these parameters in the SFS (Fig. 4; Table S5, Supporting Information). In the case of the PAG plus the Sea of Oman, the model that best fitted our data (ΔAIC = 1,615, Fig. 4; Table S4, Supporting Information) also revealed a scenario of simultaneous cladogenesis in isolation with migration dating back 37,760 years (95% CI = [18,950-161,565]), prior to the last glacial maximum. Signs of some gene flow were detected among PAG lineages. While narrower than in the Red Sea estimates, the ranges also included values near to zero in most cases, reducing the certainty in the model (Fig. 4; Table S5, Supporting Information). In the analysis with representatives of each biogeographic region of the Arabian Peninsula, the highest likelihood corresponded once again to the model including migration (ΔAIC = 1,067, Fig. 4; Table S4, Supporting Information), and revealed splitting times of 70,180 years (95% CI = [14,074-161,976]) and 153,140 years (95% CI = [90,714-416,863]) (Fig. 4; Table S5, Supporting Information).Phylogenetic relationships recovered with TreeMix were consistent with the maximum likelihood tree generated with IQ-TREE. A tree model with ten migration events explained up to 99.8% of the SNP variance, revealing signs of both historical and contemporary gene flow among mangrove populations. Two recovered bands of ancestral migration between the outgroup lineage of Brisbane and the northern populations of both the Red Sea and the PAG seemed highly unlikely, so that these results should be interpreted with caution (Fig. 5).Candidate genes and environmental adaptation patterns in Arabian gray mangrovesEnvironmental predictors explained 33.2% of the total genetic variance in the simple RDA (Adjusted R2 = 0.332, p-value < 0.01). The scores of the simple RDA revealed distinct association patterns among biogeographic regions. Red Sea mangroves showed high, negative loading values on RDA axis (RD) 1, while the remaining populations correlated positively with this axis, and heavily in the case of the Sea of Oman and PAG southern basin. In contrast, the Arabian Sea populations showed high negative association values with RD2, while Red Sea and PAG mangroves showed positive association scores along this axis, yet the former with much lower correlation values. In the pRDA, environmental variables explained 6.4%of the total genetic variance after controlling for population structure (Adjusted R2 = 0.064, p-value < 0.01). Scores revealed a more scattered pattern of variation among and within biogeographic regions, where populations from northern PAG showed high positive correlation with pRD1, while populations of the southern PAG and Arabian Sea, as well as from Central Red Sea, showed more limited, negative loading values. In the case of the pRD2, highest loading values corresponded to Qurm, with a positive correlation, and to Ras Ghurab and Suweihat, that correlated negatively (Table S6, Supporting Information).The simple and the partial RDA were jointly used to test for signs of selection applying the method described in Capblancq et al. (2018). The first to axes of the simple RDA accounted for an unadjusted proportion of explained variance equal to 38.8% (R2 = 0.388) out of 48.0% explained by the full model. In turn, the four axes of the partial RDA accounted for 32.3% (R2 = 0.323). Two and four RDA axes from the simple and partial RDA, respectively, were thereby used for candidate loci identification. The analyses revealed 446 genetic variants showing significant associations with one or more of the four environmental predictors in both the RDA and pRDA (NRDA = 3,015; NpRDA = 73,671; Njoint = 446; Fig. S2, Supporting Information). Of the 446 outliers, 70 were located within 31 functionally annotated genes. Reported functions of the identified genes and gene variants in flowering plants potentially relevant for mangroves in this marginal Arabian environment include the following: tolerance to chronic heat stress (MGE2; Hu et al., 2012); drought resistance by stomatal aperture and density regulation, as well as root development (ABIL2; Li et al., 2015); root hydrotropism and drought tolerance; water transport and osmotic pressure control in response to drought and salt stress (PIP; Katsuhara & Hanba, 2008; Mahdieh et al., 2008; Rodríguez-Gamir et al., 2011); cell wall biosynthesis and development (BXL2; Goujon et al., 2003; Zhao et al., 2010); organ growth adjustments in response to stress conditions (MOB1A; Pinosa et al., 2013); Nitrogen uptake and coordination against biotic stress (WRK50; Cheng et al., 2021); response to salinity stress (SQS2; Shirazi et al., 2019); drought tolerance and regulation of reactive oxygen species through sterol biosynthesis (SQE2; Posé et al., 2009); terpenoid metabolism in response to drought stress (4CLL7; Madritsch et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2022); flower bud differentiation in response to light (AI5L5; Yi et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2022); and salt sensitivity in association with the ABA signaling pathway (PUM23; Huang et al., 2018) (Table S7, Supporting Information).To visually explore how adaptive variability is structured at the individual level, we conducted a complementary redundancy analysis based on the individual genotypes of the 446 candidate loci alone. The plot of the first two RDA axes revealed distinctive associations patterns only partially structured by biogeographic region: Populations from the Red Sea differentiated along a gradient loading on maximum air temperature, with northern populations (Duba, Al Wajh 1 and Al Wajh 2) showing high negative correlation values, central Red Sea (Al Lith, FB1 and FB2) clustering close to the origin of coordinates, and southern Red Sea showing positive correlations. Populations from the southwest of the Arabian Sea (Taqah and Salalah) showed a strong, positive GEA signal with isothermality, while correlated negatively with a maximum salinity gradient. In contrast, populations from the Sea of Oman presented low association values and clustered around the origin of coordinates. Populations from the PAG showed an opposite GEA pattern to those of the Arabian Sea, also differentiating along the salinity/isothermality gradient, yet associations were weaker and more scattered in the southern basin than in the northern one (Fig. 6A). Individual Euclidean distances averaged over populations in the RDA ordination space showed general similar trends (Fig. 6B), with within-region, highest differences among association patterns occurring along the Red Sea and outrunning divergence between biogeographic regions (Fig. 6B).

rayyan-220254346,Space technology: A powerful tool for safeguarding world heritage,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"The Convention Concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage (WHC), adopted by United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) on November 16, 1972, aims to ensure the identification, protection, conservation, presentation, and transmission to future generations of the world's cultural and natural heritage. The WHC works toward these goals by emphasizing the Outstanding Universal Value (OUV) of heritage sites and the unique contribution such places can make to conservation and human development agendas.1UNESCO, United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization. Operational Guidelines for the Implementation of the World Heritage Convention. Paris, France: UNESCO, 2021.Google Scholar As of the end of January 2023, the WHC has been signed by 194 state parties, covering 1,157 sites (including 900 cultural, 218 natural, and 39 mixed properties), 55 of which are considered to be in danger. These sites, totaling an area of more than 370 million hectares are designated as World Heritage (WH) sites (https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/). WH sites have played a significant role in the sustainable development of society globally and helped effectively maintain and preserve the cultural diversity and global biodiversity of the Earth.2Luo L. Wang X. Guo H. Contribution of UNESCO designated sites to the achievement of sustainable development goals.Innovation. 2022; 3100227Google Scholar However, WH sites around the world are experiencing significant impacts caused, in large part, by increasing anthropogenic threats (such as the rapid spread of urban sprawl, deforestation, resource overexploitation, air pollution, armed conflict, excessive tourism, and poor management).3Allan J.R. Venter O. Maxwell S. et al.Recent increases in human pressure and forest loss threaten many Natural World Heritage Sites.Biol. Conserv. 2017; 206: 47-55Crossref Scopus (104) Google Scholar There is also a range of overarching, long-term global challenges posed by climate change, extreme and severe weather events and geological hazards.4Vousdoukas M.I. Clarke J. Ranasinghe R. et al.African heritage sites threatened as sea-level rise accelerates.Nat. Clim. Chang. 2022; 12: 256-262Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar These threats, anthropogenic or otherwise, have put an unprecedented amount of pressure on the protection of both cultural and natural properties at the heritage sites. There is no conclusive solution to effectively protect heritage sties in the foreseeable future, and the public is becoming increasingly conscious about the negative impacts some anthropogenic activities have brought to heritage sites, exposing them to various risks for irreversible damage and loss. In light of this predicament, UNESCO, alongside its conservation partners, has been actively calling for the use of non-intrusive space technology (ST) to better evaluate and understand the detrimental factors surrounding WH sites and devise effective plans to mitigate negative impacts on OUV through the accurate identification, documentation, monitoring, and understanding of WH sites and their changes across large spatiotemporal scales. For this commentary, ST refers mainly to remote sensing (RS) based on Earth observation (EO) from space, as well as other geospatial information technologies such as geographic information systems (GIS) and global navigation satellite systems (GNSS). Even though ST was not developed intentionally for WH protection, it provides an advanced set of innovative and flexible tools that integrate scientific research into heritage science, which forms the evidential base to support measures for the protection of WH sites. ST also opens up paths of methodological innovation to facilitate future conservation of cultural and natural properties with new paradigms. On the basis of a half-century review of the applications of ST in the field of WH, we find that ST has effectively reshaped our means for WH conservation in four major domains of application: mapping, monitoring, modeling, and management of WH sites (Figure 1A). ST, as an objective and reliable ""eye"" from above for heritage experts, has enabled detailed mapping of heritages at various scales. This application commonly involves the acquisition and updatable analysis of multimodal datasets, combined with near real-time survey and investigation of WH sites and their contextual environments. ST is also an invaluable tool in identifying and designating potential new WH sites. The widespread integration of ST has played a crucial role in UNESCO's routine monitoring and emergency monitoring of cultural and natural heritages as a countermeasure to the challenges presented by global change. In particular, ST has made major contributions to fine-grained monitoring at very high resolutions in time and space and in assessing change caused by natural and/or anthropogenic processes. The combined application of RS, GIS, and augmented reality has facilitated the production of three-dimensional (3D) modeling of WH sites. In addition, photogrammetry and laser scanning can be used in WH surveys for generating 3D documentation of cultural and natural properties. Heritage information models of some popular WH sites have already been actively used in the fields of architecture study and digital ecology. The ability of ST to contribute to the conservation, planning, and management of WH sites has already been commonly used in the following domains: the definition of authenticity and integrity (AI), the mapping of OUV attributes of cultural and natural assets, the development and maintenance of heritage databases, 3D modeling and digital reconstruction, and informing WH management for sustainable development. The UNESCO WHC refers to its ""strategic objectives"" as the ""5 C's"": credibility, conservation, capacity building, communication, and communities.1UNESCO, United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization. Operational Guidelines for the Implementation of the World Heritage Convention. Paris, France: UNESCO, 2021.Google Scholar Here, we propose five key contributions (""5 D's"") of ST for conservation work involving WH sites (see Figure 1B): data, driver, discovery, digital transformation, and decision support. ST and the 5 D's, together with the WHC, constitute the ""turbine model"" for safeguarding WH that is proposed in this commentary and will assist in achieving the 5 C's over the next 50 years. By providing massive multi-source data, ST plays a crucial role in the WH governance chain. Archived data together with ongoing data acquisition record changes at WH sites and provide evidence for their conservation. The data collected through ST will, in turn, serve as an invaluable store of not only raw observations but also derivative products that can be extracted from imagery.5Levin N. Ali S. Crandall D. et al.World Heritage in danger: big data and remote sensing can help protect sites in conflict zones.Global Environ. Change. 2019; 55: 97-104Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar As a result of this data mechanism, ST will be able to mitigate the problem of lacunae in WH data by offering global coverage and consistency. ST is driving a revolution to become a new paradigm of WH protection. It provides advanced tools, such as RS data processing and GIS spatial analysis powered by machine learning, which can be used for dynamic monitoring and spatiotemporal analysis of changes that are occurring at WH sites. From this enhanced monitoring method, WH specialists and managers are empowered with the tools to monitor change over time and to assess whether conservation efforts to mitigate the impacts of natural and anthropogenic processes are contributing to positive outcomes toward sustainability. ST plays a key role in aiding frontier research across multiple disciplines related to heritage science. Scientific discoveries based on the use of new geospatial technologies and big EO data can be applied to the quantitative assessment of the state of WH protection. They can also be used to support deepened multidimensional interpretations of the OUV of WH sites, to guide the sustainable use of WH, and to improve accessibility so that all stakeholders may obtain unbiased and open information, thus increasing the credibility of WH as a global brand. ST provides a means of digital transformation that can be used for identifying, understanding, visualizing, presenting, and interpreting WH sites and their OUV in the digital space. In the future, ST will promote the transformation of WH protection through studies such as tangible heritage, digitalized heritage, or both. GIS-aided digital transformation will greatly improve the quality and efficiency of global communication and the dissemination of information related to WH sites, promoting public awareness of protection concepts and smoothing the implementation of actions. ST is becoming an invaluable tool to provide decision-making support along the entire chain of WH governance, from mapping to monitoring, modeling, and management. ST-based solutions could offer spatial intelligence to inform strategic decision making for multiple stakeholders, including local communities, WH sectors, institutions, and organizations. It offers an innovative path for capacity building and capacity enhancement in relation to the global governance of WH. These solutions are delivered in numerous ways, including databases, technologies, protocols, visualization platforms, and analytical systems. WH is under the influence of a wide array of anthropogenic and natural processes, giving the heritage bodies and national and international organizations promoting the preservation of WH sites an unprecedented opportunity to use science, technology, and innovation, including ST, to experiment innovative solutions and promote the role of WH in achieving sustainable development. Given that natural and anthropogenic challenges can present similar issues in various regions across the globe, it is evident that sharing knowledge and expertise, as well as developing collective strategies to leverage ST, while tailoring our methods to local circumstances, will be fundamental in developing a global approach for WH that is successful in the long run. The past 50 years of applications have resulted in continuous innovation in the development of ST to become powerful, cutting-edge tools for use in heritage documentation, monitoring, assessment and protection, and sustainable development. Although the progress is promising, we must underscore that relying solely on ST is insufficient; the greatest benefits are achieved by integrating ST with a variety of disciplines, such as management, economics, sustainability, sociology, education, ethics, politics, law, art, and aesthetics. Through closer and sustained engagement with a broader cross-section of society and local communities, ST can contribute to opening new horizons for WH protection over the course of the twenty-first century.

rayyan-220256242,"Ecology of Lake Erie - Nutrients, microbes, algae, and dreissenid mussels: A synthesis",,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"The Lake Erie ecosystem, including its physical, chemical, and biological components, has changed considerably during recent decades owing to human-induced environmental stress (Fraker et al., 2022; Makarewicz and Bertram, 1991; Munawar and Munawar, 1976; Sinclair et al., 2021). While much has been learned from monitoring and research activities, a full understanding of how and why the ecosystem has changed is lacking (Fraker et al., 2023; Fussell et al., 2016; Sterner et al., 2017; Scavia et al., 2023), which has hampered the development of management strategies that can help sustain the integrity of the lake and its valued ecosystem services (e.g. clean water, safe recreation, food production). This AEHM special issue is the first of four focused on Lake Erie, all of which will aim to display the science being conducted to enhance ecosystem understanding and guide management decision-making.This special issue centers on watershed, nutrient, microbial (including cyanobacteria), algal, and dreissenid mussel dynamics, including their causes and consequences. Specifically, it focuses on understanding factors that have driven changes in: 1) nutrient loading and in-lake nutrient dynamics; 2) algal and cyanobacteria dynamics; and 3) dreissenid growth, impacts, and spatial variation. After recapping each paper's major messages and management implications, we offer some concluding remarks.Since the early 2000s, Lake Erie has shown signs of intensified eutrophication, including increases in the extent and duration of hypoxia and harmful algal blooms dominated by cyanobacteria (hereafter, cyanoHABs; Scavia et al., 2014; Watson et al., 2016). Some of those symptoms have been linked to altered nutrient dynamics in Lake Erie's watersheds and, particularly, significant increases in dissolved reactive phosphorus loads (Baker et al., 2014; Stumpf et al., 2016). The source of most phosphorus entering Lake Erie is agriculture (Wilson et al., 2018); however, this source is dispersed across the landscape (Kast et al., 2021) and difficult to mitigate. Thus, delineating the characteristics of watersheds that export the largest amount of nutrients is important to identifying locations where nutrient reduction will be most effective. While reducing nutrient input is critical, the behavior of nutrients once they have entered the lake is likely to influence where and when cyanoHABs occur. Toward improving our understanding of eutrophication, two of this AEHM special issue's contributors focused on identifying causes of variation in the dynamics of nutrient loading and approaches to model the availability of these loads on chemicophysical conditions.Johnson et al. (2023) sought to identify how watershed characteristics have influenced nutrient and sediment inputs into western Lake Erie. To this end, these authors used a suite of physical attributes, land uses, and point-source contributions to characterize seven tributary watersheds, six of which are Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement Annex 4 priority watersheds, and five sub-watersheds. The authors then used principal components regression analysis to determine their relationship with nutrient and sediment yields into Lake Erie. Briefly, their results demonstrated spatial (regional) variation in contributions of nutrients and sediments from each river during 2017-2021 that was related to watershed attributes. For example, nutrient inputs into Lake Erie from watersheds were positively related to the percentage of land supporting cultivated crops and poorly drained soils, with higher slopes and lower amounts of pasture being positively correlated with sediment yields. These authors then discussed their findings in the context of impending nutrient reductions aimed at mitigation of Lake Erie's recent re-eutrophication (Baker et al., 2019), explaining how consideration of regional differences in nutrient and sediment yields could benefit nutrient management planning.While Johnson et al. centered on factors that influence nutrient and sediment loading into Lake Erie, Bocaniov et al. (2023) focused how nutrient (total phosphorus, TP) inputs affect within-lake TP movement and distribution. These authors used an updated phosphorus mass-balance model (2003-2016) to derive TP load-response relationships and response matrices to predict steady-state lake TP concentrations as a function of variable external TP inputs. A key finding is that inter-basin transfer of TP plays a large role in driving basin-specific TP concentrations (e.g. inflow from the central basin contributes ∼70% of the resident TP in the eastern basin). Bocaniov et al.'s modeling also demonstrated that western Lake Erie is likely to respond quickly (93 days) to reduced TP inputs, with longer response times estimated in the central and eastern basins (540 and 303 days, respectively). These authors then discuss how their findings can help guide where in the watershed to manage nutrients and what timeframes may be needed before agencies can expect to see impacts of nutrient abatement efforts.An outcome of excessive agricultural nutrient loading into aquatic ecosystems is enhanced primary production. Lake Erie has experienced increases in benthic algae (e.g. Cladophora), pelagic algae, and cyanobacteria during both past (1960s-1970s) and more recent eutrophication events (Munawar and Munawar, 1996; O'Donnell et al., 2023; Vollenweider et al., 1974; Watson et al., 2016). Lake Erie is a large and complex ecosystem, however, and the specific type or location of algal blooms cannot be predicted by nutrient loading alone. Rather, how and where blooms form will depend on complex processes such as gazing pressure and nutrient availability within the lake, as well as water warming that will interact with high nutrient availability. With this backdrop, four papers in this AEHM special issue sought to enhance our ability to understand and describe the dynamics of primary producers, including algae and cyanobacteria.To help better understand the mechanisms responsible for benthic Cladophora outbreaks in eastern Lake Erie since dreissenid mussels colonized the lake, Depew et al. (2023) quantified the enzymatically hydrolysable portion (EHP) of dissolved organic phosphorus (DOP). Samples were collected during May through September 2019 at varying depths along the north shore of the eastern basin. These authors found that the EHP substantially contributed to the dissolved P pool, with this contribution averaging 53% of the total dissolved P and 63% of the DOP concentration. Hence, a large amount of DOP appears bioavailable owing to enzymatic hydrolysis. This result, combined with the fact that bioavailable DOP concentrations often exceeded dissolved reactive P concentrations, indicates an increased role of the benthic contributions to P bioavailability in the eastern basin since the establishment of dreissenid mussels. In turn, Depew et al. highlight the need to consider EHP when designing management strategies to control Cladophora outbreaks in the eastern basin.In contrast to Depew et al., Hoffman et al. (2023) quantified seasonal nitrification in Lake Erie's water column and explored its potential role in driving microbial dynamics, including cyanoHABs dominated by Microcystis spp. To do so, these authors used the stable isotope, 15NH4+, to track nitrification and qPCR to determine the relative abundances of ammonia oxidizing organisms (i.e. bacteria and Archaea, AOO) during 2015-2017. Hoffman et al. found that nitrification rates were lower during cyanoHABs, suggesting that AOOs were not good competitors with cyanobacteria for ammonia. These low rates can in part explain why cyanoHABs dominated by Microcystis spp. (non-nitrogen fixers) can persist despite low bioavailable nitrogen (N). Further, the removal of bioavailable N via coupled nitrification-denitrification is lower than the increase in bioavailable N through regeneration and external N loading. Using these findings, Hoffman et al. discuss the importance of reducing N loading into Lake Erie as a means to help reduce seasonal cyanoHABs.Hounshell et al. (2023) also focused on understanding cyanoHAB dynamics, exploring the role of P as a driver instead of N. While total bioavailable P (TBP) loading from the Maumee River (Ohio, USA) during spring has been shown to be a strong predictor of cyanoHAB severity in western Lake Erie (Baker et al., 2014; Bertani et al., 2016; Stumpf et al., 2016), much unexplained variation in cyanoHAB severity remains. Thus, Hounshell et al. (2023) sought to identify environmental variables that could improve the predictive relationship between the Maumee River spring TBP load and cyanoHAB severity. Their modeling showed that at both low (< 273 MTA) and high (> 332 MTA) TBP loads levels, no other environmental factors improved predictive accuracy of cyanoHABs in western Lake Erie. However, during years with intermediate springtime TBP loads (273-332 MTA), predictions of cyanoHABs could be improved by considering winter and July TBP loads, as well as ice extent and phenology. While their work is still ongoing, Hounshell et al.'s research highlights the value of both tributary and in-lake monitoring, as well as process-based modeling to cyanoHAB forecasting.Wang et al. (2023) also sought to use modeling to predict the distribution of cyanoHABs in Lake Erie. Specifically, these authors compared the performance of the one-dimensional (1D) Aquatic Ecosystem Dynamics–General Lake Model (AED–GLM) and the three-dimensional (3D) Aquatic Ecosystem Model (AEM3D–iWQ) in predicting cyanoHABs, phytoplankton biomass (as measured by chlorophyll a), and associated physicochemical conditions (e.g. water temperature, nutrients), among other things, in western Lake Erie during 2008 and 2011-2014. By qualitatively comparing their results to in situ observations, Wang et al. showed that the 3D model better reproduced seasonal and spatial variation in nutrients and phytoplankton with less error than the 1D model. Conversely, cyanoHABs were better predicted by the 1D model. As detailed in their paper, Wang et al. explain how the scale at which these models are calibrated can drive differences in model performance. These authors also discuss the implications of their findings for choosing the appropriate model to support management endeavors, including how to best calibrate them to achieve desired goals.The final set of papers centered on invasive dreissenid mussels, which have become a ubiquitous part of the Great Lakes since their introduction nearly four decades ago (Nalepa et al., 2005). Owing to their potential to negatively impact native mussels (Schloesser et al., 2006), zooplankton communities (Johannsson et al., 2000), phytoplankton biomass (Bocaniov et al., 2014), and nutrient cycling (Hecky et al., 2004), Zebra (Dreissena polymorpha) and Quagga (D. rostiformis bugensis) Mussels have garnered the interest of researchers and management agencies alike. Much of this effort has been devoted to understanding the mechanisms that influence dreissenid demographics and impacts of the food web, which are the focus of the last set of papers in this AEHM special issue.To understand the growth dynamics of dreissenid mussels and their impact on phytoplankton in western Lake Erie, Carter et al. (2023) combined field surveys, in situ growth experiments, and laboratory excretion and grazing experiments. Their results, which are important in interpreting two of the remaining AEHM special issue papers, showed that dreissenid communities have lower clearance rates and excretion rates compared to previously reported rates. This understanding, combined with reduced dreissenid densities in Lake Erie during recent decades, led Carter et al. to conclude that the ability of dreissenids to compound the effect of eutrophication that causes cyanoHABs may be less than previously thought (e.g. Vanderploeg et al., 2009; but see Carrick et al., 2023 and Vanderploeg et al., 2023). Carter et al. (2023) acknowledge, however, that the impact of dreissenids could be locally high at times, owing to their patchy distribution across the basin. In turn, these authors stress the need for frequent, fine-scale benthic surveys, which could improve ability to understand and forecast the impacts of dreissenids on the ecosystem.Carrick et al. (2023) also sought to quantify the impact of dreissenid mussels on plankton assemblages (heterotrophs and phototrophs) in western Lake Erie. Using controlled experiments conducted monthly during May through October 2018, these authors show that dreissenids graze actively throughout the growing season, consuming nano-sized heterotrophic and phototrophic plankton (e.g. phototrophic cryptophytes, centric diatoms, and non-pigmented chrysomonads). By contrast, lower clearance rates of cyanobacteria (e.g. Microcystis spp.), dinoflagellates, and some colonial chlorophytes were observed. Carrick et al. further suggest that selective dreissenid grazing on ""non-harmful"" plankton species in the nanoplankton size range, combined with lower grazing rates on larger cyanobacteria and chlorophyte species, could contribute to western Lake Erie's cyanoHAB problem. Notably, the small-scale experimental results of Carrick et al. contrast those from Carter et al.'s (2023) field-based study. This discrepancy highlights the value of both experimental and field-based approaches, as well as the need to carefully consider the spatiotemporal context of the investigation, when to quantifying the role of dreissenid grazing as a secondary promoter (above nutrient loading) of cyanoHABs.Vanderploeg et al. (2023) also used an experimental approach to quantity the impacts of dreissenid mussel grazing on the phytoplankton community. Their experiments showed that grazing pressure on phytoplankton varied during May through October, with grazing on cryptophytes and diatoms being high during late May through early July. Despite cyanophytes dominating the phytoplankton beginning in late July, dreissenid grazing on them was non-existent or low. Interestingly, 16S rRNA gene-sequencing analyses showed a diverse cyanobacteria community with Planktothrix dominating during the spring and Cyanobium dominating most of the summer through fall. By contrast, Microcystis, which is largely thought to dominate cyanoHABs in Lake Erie, only dominated during late June. Further, Microcystis was preferentially rejected by Quagga Mussels relative to other cyanobacteria. Using these findings, Vanderploeg et al. draw a similar conclusion as Carrick et al. (2023) by suggesting that dreissenid grazing can favor specific cyanobacteria such as Microcystis. Importantly, however, the final effect of dreissenid grazing as a secondary promoter of cyanoHABS depends on the population density of dreissenids, which is currently low (Carter et al., 2023).In this special issue's final paper, Elgin et al. (2023) conducted an in situ study to quantify spatial variation in colonization potential, growth rates, and abundance of dreissenid mussels at two sites with contrasting water-column conditions in western Lake Erie. Despite finding comparable dreissenid colonization potential and growth between study sites, both on and in the experimental cages, Elgin et al. found fewer mussels in the surrounding sediment at the site nearer the Maumee River. These authors use this finding to conclude that water-column conditions appear to favor dreissenid settlement and growth on hard surfaces suspended above the substrate across the western basin, but that conditions on or near the substrate may inhibit mussel settling and growth. Elgin et al. eventually discuss how substrate-driven bottlenecks could inform our understanding of dreissenid recruitment and distribution, as well as nutrient dynamics, in western Lake Erie. These authors also suggest how better characterization of substrate conditions could support dreissenid control efforts.Owing to the impact of humans, the world's ecosystems have been experiencing dramatic change, which has threatened their structure, function, and dynamics, as well as their capacity to support services valued by society. The world's Great Lakes are no exception with these ecosystems being degraded by numerous anthropogenic stressors, including nutrient alteration (both eutrophication and oligotrophication), non-native species invasions, habitat destruction, and climate change, among many others (Allan et al., 2013; Jenny, 2020; Odada et al., 2003). The magnitude, multitude, and simultaneous nature of these stressors have in turn challenged both researchers seeking to understand the dynamics of these ecosystems and agencies charged with managing the valued natural resources (e.g. fish, wildlife) and other services (e.g. safe drinking water, recreational opportunities) that these ecosystems provide (Allan et al., 2013; Odada and Olago, 2006; Sterner et al., 2017). Such challenges highlight the need for continued research aimed at understanding the causes and consequences of anthropogenic change.While all the large lakes of the world have been altered by anthropogenic stress, Lake Erie is among the most degraded. Its susceptibility to anthropogenic stress is largely due to its small size, shallow depth, high connectivity via shipping, and large watershed that supports both large cities and agricultural production (Fraker et al, 2022; Ludsin et al., 2001; Reutter, 2019). Most relevant to this AEHM special issue, Lake Erie has shifted trophic states multiple times in response to human impacts and subsequent mitigation efforts. Prior to the 1950s, Lake Erie was primarily in a pre-industrial state of mesotrophy-oligotrophy and shifted to a state of hypertrophy-mesotrophy during the 1960s-1970s. During the 1980s-1990s, it shifted back to more mesotrophic conditions in response to both mitigation efforts designed to reduce point-source inputs of TP and the invasion of dreissenid mussels. Most recently (post 2000), Lake Erie returned to a more eutrophic state due to non-point source runoff of dissolved reactive phosphorus (Kane et al., 2014; Ludsin et al., 2001; Sinclair et al., 2023; Vollenweider et al., 1974). Concomitantly, Lake Erie has currently been experiencing increases in the magnitude and extent of both bottom hypoxia and cyanoHABs (Scavia et al., 2014; Watson et al., 2016), which are threatening: human health through cyanotoxin exposure (e.g. Francy et al., 2016; Wituszynski et al., 2017); fish populations and the fisheries that they support (e.g. Stone et al., 2020; Wolf et al., 2017); and the regional economy through effects on tourism and property values (Smith et al., 2019; Wolf et al., 2022). These threats have increased the need for the science necessary to make informed management decisions (Fraker et al., 2023; Fussell et al., 2016; Sterner et al., 2017; Scavia et al., 2023), which includes describing the current state of the Lake Erie ecosystem and understanding the causal mechanisms of recent ecosystem change.The contributions to this AEHM special issue have provided new insights into the drivers of nutrient inputs, in-lake nutrient concentrations, benthic algae (Cladophora), planktonic heterotrophs, microbial autotrophs (including cyanobacteria responsible for cyanoHABs), algae (e.g. diatoms, cryptophytes), and dreissenid mussels. Further, each study has provided information that could benefit management, whether it be ecological understanding that could support ecosystem modeling (e.g. quantifying dreissenid distributions and their impacts on grazing rates and nutrient excretion; Carter et al., 2023; Elgin et al., 2023) or tools that could support nutrient management decision-making (e.g. Bocaniov et al., 2023; Johnson et al, 2023), cyanoHAB severity (e.g. Carrick et al.,. 2023; Hounshell et al., 2023; Vanderploeg et al., 2023) or chemicophysical conditions, including algal and cyanobacteria biomass (e.g. Depew et al., 2023; Hoffman et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023). While many additional messages can be found in the papers, collectively, three key conclusions can be made. First, findings from each of the three focal areas of this AEHM special issue highlight the need to consider fine spatial and/or temporal scales in both the watershed and the lake proper. Doing so offers a means to fully appreciate the complex array of processes driving the dynamics of Lake Erie's chemicophysical conditions and lower food web (e.g. primary producers, dreissenid mussels). Second, while the papers in this special issue showed the value of field-, laboratory-, and modeling-based research to describing, understanding, or predicting ecosystem conditions, they also pointed to challenges that can arise when integrating findings. For example, discrepancies can arise owing to studies being conducted in different settings (e.g. in the laboratory vs. in the field) or at different spatiotemporal scales (e.g. see Carrick et al., 2023; Carter et al., 2023; Vanderploeg et al., 2023). Finally, most papers demonstrated the need for continued and intensified monitoring (e.g. broader coverage at finer spatial and temporal scales), which will challenge agencies responsible for tracking ecosystem conditions. We expect, however, that continued improvement in our ability to cost-effectively monitor Lake Erie and its watershed via remote sensing technologies (Yang et al., 2022; Yin et al., 2021), combined with continually improving data-analytic approaches (e.g. machine and deep learning; Sun and Scanlon, 2019), will help agencies meet this challenge.While the research described in this AEHM special issue has addressed many knowledge gaps, many more remain. Our hope is that continued reporting of findings as part of this AEHM Ecology of Lake Erie series will increase our ability to understand and model the structure, function, and dynamics of the ecosystem. Such understanding and tools should facilitate our continued movement towards ecosystem-based management in the Great Lakes, which could help agencies rehabilitate the lake and sustainably manage its valued resources in the face of continued anthropogenic stress.We thank Ken Minns for providing helpful feedback on a previous version of this synthesis.","",https://doi.org/10.14321/aehm.026.04.131,"",,

rayyan-220256390,"Downscaling CMIP6 Global Solutions to Regional Ocean Carbon Model: Connecting the Mississippi, Gulf of Mexico, and Global Ocean",,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract. Coupled physical-biogeochemical models can significantly reduce uncertainties in estimating the spatial and temporal patterns of the ocean carbon system. Challenges of applying a coupled physical-biogeochemical model in the regional ocean include the reasonable prescription of carbon model boundary conditions, lack of in situ observations, and the oversimplification of certain biogeochemical processes. In this study, we applied a coupled physical-biogeochemical model (Regional Ocean Modelling System, ROMS) to the Gulf of Mexico (GoM) and achieved an unprecedented 20-year high-resolution (5 km, 1/22°) hindcast covering the period of 2000–2019. The model’s biogeochemical cycle is driven by the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 6-Community Earth System Model 2 products (CMIP6-CESM2) and incorporates the dynamics of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) pools as well as the formation and dissolution of carbonate minerals. Model outputs include generally interested carbon system variables, such as pCO2, pH, aragonite saturation state (ΩArag), calcite saturation state (ΩCalc), CO2 air-sea flux, carbon burial rate, etc. The model’s robustness is evaluated via extensive model-data comparison against buoy, remote sensing-based Machine Learning (ML) predictions, and ship-based measurements. Model results reveal that the GoM water has been experiencing an ~ 0.0016 yr−1 decrease in surface pH over the past two decades, accompanied by a ~ 1.66 µatm yr−1 increase in sea surface pCO2. The air-sea CO2 exchange estimation confirms that the river-dominated northern GoM is a substantial carbon sink. The open water of GoM, affected mainly by the thermal effect, is a carbon source during summer and a carbon sink for the rest of the year. Sensitivity experiments are conducted to evaluate the impacts from river inputs and the global ocean via model boundaries. Our results show that the coastal ocean carbon cycle is dominated by enormous carbon inputs from the Mississippi River and nutrient-stimulated biological activities, and the carbon system condition of the open ocean is primarily driven by inputs from the Caribbean Sea via Yucatan Channel.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-2021-339,"",,

rayyan-220256744,Potential of Convolutional Neural Networks for Forest Mapping Using Sentinel-1 Interferometric Short Time Series,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"The monitoring of land cover and land use patterns is pivotal in the joint effort to fight deforestation in the Amazon and study its relation to climate change effects with respect to anthropogenic activities. Most of the region, typically monitored with optical sensors, is hidden by a persistent cloud cover for most of the wet season. The necessity for a consistent and reliable deforestation warning system based on cloud-independent radar data is therefore of particular interest. In this paper, we investigated the potential of combining deep learning with Sentinel-1 (S-1) Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) short time series (STS), covering only 24 d of acquisitions, to map endangered areas in the Amazon Basin. To this end, we implemented a U-Net-like convolutional neural network (CNN) for multi-layer semantic segmentation, trained from scratch with different sets of input features to evaluate the viability of the proposed approach for different operating conditions. As input features, we relied on both multi-temporal backscatter and interferometric coherences at different temporal baselines. We provide a detailed performance benchmark of the different configurations, also considering the current state-of-the-art approaches based on S-1 STS and shallow learners. Our findings showed that, by exploiting the powerful learning capabilities of CNNs, we outperformed the STS-based approaches published in the literature and significantly reduced the computational load. Indeed, when considering the entire stack of Sentinel-1 data at a 6 d revisit time, we were able to maintain the overall accuracy and F1-score well above 90% and reduce the computational time by more than 50% with respect to state-of-the-art approaches, by avoiding the generation of handcrafted feature maps. Moreover, we achieved satisfactory results even when only S-1 InSAR acquisitions with a revisit time of 12 d or more were used, setting the groundwork for an effective and fast monitoring of tropical forests at a global scale.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/rs14061381,"",,
rayyan-220256900,Spatially Explicit Seagrass Extent Mapping Across the Entire Mediterranean,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"The seagrass Posidonia oceanica is the main habitat-forming species of the coastal Mediterranean, providing millennial-scale ecosystem services including habitat provisioning, biodiversity maintenance, food security, coastal protection, and carbon sequestration. Meadows of this endemic seagrass species represent the largest carbon storage among seagrasses around the world, largely contributing to global blue carbon stocks. Yet, the slow growth of this temperate species and the extreme projected temperature and sea-level rise due to climate change increase the risk of reduction and loss of these services. Currently, there are knowledge gaps in its basin-wide spatially explicit extent and relevant accounting, therefore accurate and efficient mapping of its distribution and trajectories of change is needed. Here, we leveraged contemporary advances in Earth Observation—cloud computing, open satellite data, and machine learning—with field observations through a cloud-native geoprocessing framework to account the spatially explicit ecosystem extent of P. oceanica seagrass across its full bioregional scale. Employing 279,186 Sentinel-2 satellite images between 2015 and 2019, and a human-labeled training dataset of 62,928 pixels, we mapped 19,020 km 2 of P. oceanica meadows up to 25 m of depth in 22 Mediterranean countries, across a total seabed area of 56,783 km 2 . Using 2,480 independent, field-based points, we observe an overall accuracy of 72%. We include and discuss global and region-specific seagrass blue carbon stocks using our bioregional seagrass extent estimate. As reference data collections, remote sensing technology and biophysical modelling improve and coalesce, such spatial ecosystem extent accounts could further support physical and monetary accounting of seagrass condition and ecosystem services, like blue carbon and coastal biodiversity. We envisage that effective policy uptake of these holistic seagrass accounts in national climate strategies and financing could accelerate transparent natural climate solutions and coastal resilience, far beyond the physical location of seagrass beds.","",https://doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2022.871799,"",,
rayyan-220257461,Blue carbon ecosystem monitoring using remote sensing reveals wetland restoration pathways,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"In an era of climate and biodiversity crises, ecosystem rehabilitation is critical to the ongoing wellbeing of humans and the environment. Coastal ecosystem rehabilitation is particularly important, as these ecosystems sequester large quantities of carbon (known in marine ecosystems as “blue carbon”) thereby mitigating climate change effects while also providing ecosystem services and biodiversity benefits. The recent formal accreditation of blue carbon services is producing a proliferation of rehabilitation projects, which must be monitored and quantified over time and space to assess on-ground outcomes. Consequently, remote sensing techniques such as drone surveys, and machine learning techniques such as image classification, are increasingly being employed to monitor wetlands. However, few projects, if any, have tracked blue carbon restoration across temporal and spatial scales at an accuracy that could be used to adequately map species establishment with low-cost methods. This study presents an open-source, user-friendly workflow, using object-based image classification and a random forest classifier in Google Earth Engine, to accurately classify 4 years of multispectral and photogrammetrically derived digital elevation model drone data at a saltmarsh rehabilitation site on the east coast of Australia (Hunter River estuary, NSW). High classification accuracies were achieved, with &amp;gt;90% accuracy at 0.1 m resolution. At the study site, saltmarsh colonised most suitable areas, increasing by 142% and resulting in 56 tonnes of carbon sequestered, within a 4-year period, providing insight into blue carbon regeneration trajectories. Saltmarsh growth patterns were species-specific, influenced by species’ reproductive and dispersal strategies. Our findings suggested that biotic factors and interactions were important in influencing species’ distributions and succession trajectories. This work can help improve the efficiency and effectiveness of restoration planning and monitoring at coastal wetlands and similar ecosystems worldwide, with the potential to apply this approach to other types of remote sensing imagery and to calculate other rehabilitation co-benefits. Importantly, the method can be used to calculate blue carbon habitat creation following tidal restoration of coastal wetlands.","",https://doi.org/10.3389/fenvs.2022.924221,"",,
rayyan-220257602,Explainable deep learning for insights in El Niño and river flows,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"The El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is a semi-periodic fluctuation in sea surface temperature (SST) over the tropical central and eastern Pacific Ocean that influences interannual variability in regional hydrology across the world through long-range dependence or teleconnections. Recent research has demonstrated the value of Deep Learning (DL) methods for improving ENSO prediction as well as Complex Networks (CN) for understanding teleconnections. However, gaps in predictive understanding of ENSO-driven river flows include the black box nature of DL, the use of simple ENSO indices to describe a complex phenomenon and translating DL-based ENSO predictions to river flow predictions. Here we show that eXplainable DL (XDL) methods, based on saliency maps, can extract interpretable predictive information contained in global SST and discover SST information regions and dependence structures relevant for river flows which, in tandem with climate network constructions, enable improved predictive understanding. Our results reveal additional information content in global SST beyond ENSO indices, develop understanding of how SSTs influence river flows, and generate improved river flow prediction, including uncertainty estimation. Observations, reanalysis data, and earth system model simulations are used to demonstrate the value of the XDL-CN based methods for future interannual and decadal scale climate projections.","",https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2201.02596,"",,

The spatio-temporal resolution and survey responsiveness afforded by these low-cost platforms enables the collection of data that can provide insights on the spatio-temporal dynamics of individual marine animals at close range (Anderson & Gaston, 2013). In the last decade there has been an increase in marine studies utilizing UAVs (Schofield et al., 2019), which allows for novel insights on the abundance (Hodgson et al., 2017), behavior (Fiori et al., 2020; Torres et al., 2018), and body condition (Christiansen et al., 2016; Hodgson et al., 2020) of marine wildlife. Importantly, UAV-based image capture has the potential to increase the duration of visible observation through detection of animals below the water surface (Torres et al., 2018). This has significant ramifications for the study of mother-calf humpback whale groups that rest in shallow protected embayments (Bruce et al., 2014; McCulloch et al., 2021), spending high proportions of time resting at depths of <5 m (Bejder et al., 2019; Iwata et al., 2021). However, the use of remotely sensed data in coastal environments is challenged by the optical complexity of the water column (Figure 1). Research until now has focused primarily on image detection based on the visual spectrum with limited evaluation of conventional remote sensing methods for enhancing observation of whales. Processing techniques are commonly used in remote sensing research to enhance or enable the detection of underwater features, including benthic habitat (Hedley et al., 2016; Mumby et al., 1998; Zoffoli et al., 2014). Similar techniques, including water column correction, can be applied to UAV-captured images to enhance visibility of animals below the water surface, which may be missed in manual counts or automated deep-learning based classifications (Gray et al., 2019). This paper presents remote sensing-based methods for enhancing UAV-acquired visual image data to improve the contrast of whales on the water surface and submerged near the surface. Application of these methods has the potential to reduce perception error (Colefax et al., 2018) and subsequently improve detection rates. The Jervis Bay Marine Park study site on the eastern Australian coastline is frequented by humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) mother-calf groups during the southern migration from the breeding grounds (Bruce et al., 2014; Jones, 2019). FIGURE 1Open in figure viewerPowerPoint Diagram illustrating the various processes contributing to complexities in surveying large marine species from a UAV platform. Created with BioRender (https://biorender.com/). The visible RGB imaging capabilities of sensors for detecting whales were evaluated using a DJI Mavic 2 Enterprise Dual (M2ED) launched from a small boat in Jervis Bay. Following a confirmed whale sighting, the whale's behavior and direction of travel were observed for 5 min from the boat at a distance >300 m before an approach was made to a distance >100 m from the whale. The UAV was launched to an initial altitude of 55 m to provide sufficient sensor field of view for whale identification and lowered to ≥25 m once whale(s) were visible on the controller screen. The boat remained at a distance >100 m from the whales during the flights to provide a visual line of sight to the UAV and facilitate positioning over the whales. Still images and videos were captured throughout each flight. Lyzenga's water column correction (Lyzenga, 1981) as modified by Mumby et al. (1998) and Hamylton (2011) was applied to three UAV images containing humpback whales (steps summarized in Figure 2). To enhance the spectral signature of the whale, radiance values were taken from transects along and across the whale's body surface to account for the fusiform shape of the whale (Step 3, Figure 2). This method, suitable for high clarity water, produces a depth-invariant band based on each pair of spectral (wavelength) bands (Mumby et al., 1998). This generated three depth invariant bands from the available spectral band pairs (red/green, red/blue, green/blue). To allow for comparison between the original image and processed images, all pixels were converted into Z-scores (Z = [pixel value − mean]/standard deviation), enabling detection of anomalies. The performance of the applied image processing methods was assessed visually (Figure 3), and quantitively by evaluating the mean Z-score values (Table 1) extracted across the whale's surface for the original RGB images and the three resulting band pairs. FIGURE 2Open in figure viewerPowerPoint Overview of processing steps applied in the depth invariant analysis. In Step 3, the yellow transect outlines where the radiance values were extracted for inclusion in the correction. The correction process resulted in three depth-invariant band pairs. These images were then converted into Z-scores and transects (black dotted line, Step 4) were extracted along the length of the whale to determine average values for each image.

For whales on or just below the surface, the red/green and red/blue depth-invariant band pairs were the most effective band pair combination for enhancing contrast between the whale and surrounding waters, both visually (Figure 3A and C) and resulting in the highest anomaly values (Table 1). The effectiveness of the red band for animals on or near the surface is consistent with findings from Colefax et al. (2021), who demonstrated the red band produced the greatest spectral contrast for detecting dolphins, sharks, and other marine fauna from a UAV. At increasing depths, the green/blue band pair produced a stronger visual contrast and highest anomaly result (Figure 3B; Table 1) owing to the red waveband becoming attenuated at greater depth. The depth of the target animal(s) will influence the optimal band pairing and subsequent object enhancement within the image. The red band (610–700 nm), and other bands with wavelengths approaching the red end of the spectrum (e.g., red edge and near infrared), will become fully attenuated around 2–3 m depth (Hamylton, 2011; Mishra et al., 2005). Thus, the effectiveness of band pairs using the red band will be substantially reduced at this depth. However, in turbid waters, where sightability below the surface is limited, longer wavelength bands may be optimal for increasing the contrast of animals just below the surface (Colefax et al., 2021). Image enhancement methods for improving whale detection rates even in optically shallow waters (<2–3 m) has important implications for studies reliant on whale visibility, such as estimating abundance (e.g., Hodgson et al., 2017). This is key for research conducted on breeding/resting grounds, with lactating females and their calves spending over 50% of time within 3 m of the surface (Bejder et al., 2019). The methods presented here have the potential to increase the confidence of machine learning and automated detection models. Machine learning techniques for automated detection of whales are increasingly being applied to UAV-collected data sets providing an efficient way to process large amounts of data. Studies using machine learning to detect individual animals or plants rely on the detection of target objects against mostly homogenous backgrounds which typically rely on a clear contrast to reliably discriminate animals from their surrounding environment (Laliberte & Ripple, 2003). The use of machine learning for detecting marine vertebrates is further complicated by coloration similarities between some species and the surrounding water (e.g., blue whales; Gray et al., 2019) and nonuniform backgrounds that are subject to varying environmental conditions. In ecological studies, object-based image analysis (OBIA) is the most commonly used machine learning method (Dujon & Schofield, 2019). It provides versatility for detecting objects in varied backgrounds with confounding features, objects that vary in size and shape, and may be sparsely distributed in the image data set (Chabot et al., 2018), making it ideal for abundance and distribution studies. Importantly, even with increased flexibility over other machine learning methods, OBIA is still reliant on the object(s) of interest in the image being localized from surrounding pixels through a local brightness contrast, either as a relatively brighter or relatively darker group of image pixels (Groom et al., 2013). For whale detection, increasing the anomaly (Z-score) of the whale object, as demonstrated here, could potentially improve OBIA-derived results and increase detection availability. Here we have demonstrated that water column correction techniques can enhance the visual outline and anomaly signal over the body of whales on the surface and submerged at shallow depths. However, we recognize constraints associated with the limited spectral resolution provided when working with three bands (i.e., red, green, and blue) within the visible range (wavelength 400–700 nm). Employing multispectral or hyperspectral sensors and customizing or selecting bands configured to focus on wavelength bands optimal for the spectral characteristics of the water body, such as the coastal band (Fretwell et al., 2014), and target species may further reduce perception bias and subsequently improve animal availability at depth compared to standard RGB sensors (Colefax et al., 2018). Additionally, obtaining a larger image data set is critical for understanding the effectiveness of depth invariant indices derived from possible band pairs, and whether these differ with the whale depth and environmental factors (e.g., turbidity). Ultimately, an understanding of the role of water column attenuation correction is critical for accurate detection of whales and is particularly relevant with the increasing use of low-cost UAV platforms and machine learning techniques for achieving estimates of population abundance and monitoring movement patterns of marine wildlife in shallow coastal habitats.

The spatio-temporal resolution and survey responsiveness afforded by these low-cost platforms enables the collection of data that can provide insights on the spatio-temporal dynamics of individual marine animals at close range (Anderson & Gaston, 2013). In the last decade there has been an increase in marine studies utilizing UAVs (Schofield et al., 2019), which allows for novel insights on the abundance (Hodgson et al., 2017), behavior (Fiori et al., 2020; Torres et al., 2018), and body condition (Christiansen et al., 2016; Hodgson et al., 2020) of marine wildlife. Importantly, UAV-based image capture has the potential to increase the duration of visible observation through detection of animals below the water surface (Torres et al., 2018). This has significant ramifications for the study of mother-calf humpback whale groups that rest in shallow protected embayments (Bruce et al., 2014; McCulloch et al., 2021), spending high proportions of time resting at depths of <5 m (Bejder et al., 2019; Iwata et al., 2021). However, the use of remotely sensed data in coastal environments is challenged by the optical complexity of the water column (Figure 1). Research until now has focused primarily on image detection based on the visual spectrum with limited evaluation of conventional remote sensing methods for enhancing observation of whales. Processing techniques are commonly used in remote sensing research to enhance or enable the detection of underwater features, including benthic habitat (Hedley et al., 2016; Mumby et al., 1998; Zoffoli et al., 2014). Similar techniques, including water column correction, can be applied to UAV-captured images to enhance visibility of animals below the water surface, which may be missed in manual counts or automated deep-learning based classifications (Gray et al., 2019). This paper presents remote sensing-based methods for enhancing UAV-acquired visual image data to improve the contrast of whales on the water surface and submerged near the surface. Application of these methods has the potential to reduce perception error (Colefax et al., 2018) and subsequently improve detection rates. The Jervis Bay Marine Park study site on the eastern Australian coastline is frequented by humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) mother-calf groups during the southern migration from the breeding grounds (Bruce et al., 2014; Jones, 2019). FIGURE 1Open in figure viewerPowerPoint Diagram illustrating the various processes contributing to complexities in surveying large marine species from a UAV platform. Created with BioRender (https://biorender.com/). The visible RGB imaging capabilities of sensors for detecting whales were evaluated using a DJI Mavic 2 Enterprise Dual (M2ED) launched from a small boat in Jervis Bay. Following a confirmed whale sighting, the whale's behavior and direction of travel were observed for 5 min from the boat at a distance >300 m before an approach was made to a distance >100 m from the whale. The UAV was launched to an initial altitude of 55 m to provide sufficient sensor field of view for whale identification and lowered to ≥25 m once whale(s) were visible on the controller screen. The boat remained at a distance >100 m from the whales during the flights to provide a visual line of sight to the UAV and facilitate positioning over the whales. Still images and videos were captured throughout each flight. Lyzenga's water column correction (Lyzenga, 1981) as modified by Mumby et al. (1998) and Hamylton (2011) was applied to three UAV images containing humpback whales (steps summarized in Figure 2). To enhance the spectral signature of the whale, radiance values were taken from transects along and across the whale's body surface to account for the fusiform shape of the whale (Step 3, Figure 2). This method, suitable for high clarity water, produces a depth-invariant band based on each pair of spectral (wavelength) bands (Mumby et al., 1998). This generated three depth invariant bands from the available spectral band pairs (red/green, red/blue, green/blue). To allow for comparison between the original image and processed images, all pixels were converted into Z-scores (Z = [pixel value − mean]/standard deviation), enabling detection of anomalies. The performance of the applied image processing methods was assessed visually (Figure 3), and quantitively by evaluating the mean Z-score values (Table 1) extracted across the whale's surface for the original RGB images and the three resulting band pairs. FIGURE 2Open in figure viewerPowerPoint Overview of processing steps applied in the depth invariant analysis. In Step 3, the yellow transect outlines where the radiance values were extracted for inclusion in the correction. The correction process resulted in three depth-invariant band pairs. These images were then converted into Z-scores and transects (black dotted line, Step 4) were extracted along the length of the whale to determine average values for each image. FIGURE 3Open in figure viewerPowerPoint Results of depth-invariant processing for three UAV images.

Summary· Plant systems occurring in ecologically heterogeneous and spatially discontinuous habitats provide an ideal opportunity to investigate the relative roles of neutral and selective factors in driving lineage diversification. Here, we analyzed fully sequenced genomes to study diversification mechanisms in the gray mangroves [Avicennia marina (Forssk.) Vierh.] of Arabia, where they occur at the edge of the species' range and are subject to variable, often extreme, environmental conditions. · We conducted population structure, phylogenomic and demographic analyses to reconstruct the evolutionary history of the species across Arabia. We also applied genotype-environment association methods to study adaptive mechanisms of lineage diversification. · Our analyses revealed marked genetic structure and highly supported clades among and within the seas surrounding the Arabian Peninsula. Inferred divergence times were consistent with recent periods of low marine connectivity during glacial periods, revealing the presence of (cryptic) glacial refugia in the Red Sea and the Persian/Arabian Gulf. Genetic‐environment association analyses revealed high levels of adaptive differentiation, and detected signs of multi-loci local adaptation driven by temperature extremes and hypersalinity. · These results support a process of rapid diversification resulting from the combined effects of historical factors and ecological selection, and reveal mangrove peripheral environments as relevant drivers of lineage diversity. IntroductionLineage diversification in plants involves both neutral and selective factors (Rieseberg & Willis, 2007), and elucidating their relative roles in the process of evolutionary divergence is essential to understand the mechanisms underlying the early stages of speciation (Coyne & Orr, 2004). Evolutionary divergence may result from the accumulation of genetic differences caused by drift in geographic isolation or isolation-by-distance (IBD, Wright, 1943; Wright, 1946), a mode of divergence driven by neutral factors (Mayr, 1954; Mayr, 1963). In turn, geographic variation in environmental conditions can result in divergent selection (Darwin, 1859; Coyne & Orr, 2004), the diversifying process that drives ecological speciation (Nosil, 2012). In ecological speciation models, reproductive barriers arise as a by-product of cumulative, ecologically adaptive changes (Mayr, 1947; Schluter, 2000; Rundle & Nosil, 2005) enabling genome‐wide differentiation at both neutral and selected loci (Nosil et al., 2008; Funk et al., 2011; Shafer & Wolf, 2013; Wang & Bradburd, 2014). Ecological speciation in geographic isolation is theoretically uncontroversial, and considered key in some of the most remarkable radiations in angiosperms (Baldwin & Sanderson, 1998; Hughes & Eastwood, 2006). However, whether environment-driven processes of lineage diversification commonly occur in nature in the absence of long-term isolation and reduced gene flow remains debated in evolution research (Butlin et al., 2008; Fitzpatrick et al., 2008; Papadopulos et al., 2011; Foote, 2018). The interactions between selection and the stochastic effects derived from processes such as founder events, bottlenecks and genetic drift also remain unclear, and difficult to assess in natural systems (Barton & Charlesworth, 1984; Kliber & Eckert, 2005; Crepet & Niklas, 2009).Plant systems occurring in the environmentally heterogeneous and often extreme habitats at species' range edges are suitable models to investigate questions related to lineage diversification. The environment at the edges of species' range tends to be stressful and spatially discontinuous, as well as temporally unstable (Lesica & Allendorf, 1995), frequently resulting in dynamic settings of multiple isolated populations subject to strong differential selection. The severe and stochastic character of peripheral environments is hypothesized to generate strong selective interplay between adaptation and neutral processes (Hardie & Hutchings, 2010), providing an ideal opportunity for speciation research. One such system is the gray mangrove populations of the Arabian Peninsula (Avicennia marina var. marina). The gray mangrove has the broadest distribution of any mangrove species (Spalding et al., 2010; Hogarth, 2015; Tomlinson, 2016), extending across the Indian Ocean and into the West Pacific as far as Japan and New Zealand (Fouda & AI-Muharrami, 1996; Sheppard et al., 2010; Spalding et al., 2010; Khalil, 2015). Gray mangroves present several morphological and physiological adaptations to their harsh intertidal habitat (Tomlinson, 2016), which makes them a compelling model for the study of functional genes and biological pathways involved in selection and stress tolerance in plants (Urashi et al., 2013; Xu et al., 2017). The Arabian Peninsula represents one of the northernmost edges of the species' distribution (Duke, 1991; Spalding et al., 2010; Tomlinson, 2016), as well as a stressful habitat characterized by extreme temperatures, aridity, and often extreme salinity, factors known to be limiting for mangrove growth (Ball, 1988; Sheppard et al., 1992; Lovelock et al., 2016). Arabian marine domains are also environmentally diverse both within, and among, the main water bodies bordering the peninsula, which define three main biogeographic regions: (i) the Red Sea, where the marine system presents opposing gradients of salinity and temperature, with the highest temperature and lowest salinity in the shallow southern basin, while the deeper northern basin has cooler temperatures but high salinity as a result of limited precipitation and high evaporation (Carvalho et al., 2019; Anton et al., 2020); (ii) the Persian/Arabian Gulf (referred to as 'PAG' hereafter) to the northeast of the Arabian Peninsula, where populations are subject to arid (<250 mm) to hyper-arid (<100 mm) rainfall regimes, and experience the widest range of air temperatures in the region throughout the year (Böer, 1997; Whitford & Duval, 2019); and (iii) the Arabian Sea (here including the Sea of Oman), which in contrast with former biogeographic regions, has normal oceanic salinity, and summer temperatures that are buffered by cold-water upwelling as a result of the Indian Ocean monsoon, resulting in more moderate environmental conditions (Claereboudt, 2019).The Arabian Peninsula has experienced large fluctuations in spatial and environmental conditions throughout glacio-eustatic cycles that largely impacted the biodiversity of the region, in particular for the enclosed water bodies of the Red Sea and the PAG (DiBattista et al., 2016a). Throughout the last 400,000 years the Red Sea has remained connected to the Indian Ocean, yet cross-sectional area along the Strait of Bab al Mandab that connects these water bodies was, at times of glacial maxima, as low as 2% of that today, resulting in major increases in salinity and temperature within the Red Sea as well as near-complete isolation at times (Lambeck et al., 2011). For several sustained periods during the last two glacial cycles, the minimum channel width connecting the Red Sea to the Arabian Sea was less than 4 km wide and remained narrow whenever the local sea levels were 50 meters below current levels (Lambeck et al., 2011). In contrast, models show that the PAG was nearly completely drained during the peak of the last glaciation until c.a. 14,000 years ago (Lambeck, 1996). A marine incursion into the southern PAG basin started approximately 12,500 years ago, extending towards the northern basin over the following millennia, with the present day PAG shorelines forming just 6,000 years ago (Lambeck, 1996). In contrast, as an open ocean habitat, the Arabian Sea coast has only experienced vertical migration of sea levels during these glacial periods, without geographic isolation.The combination of extreme environmental conditions, differential changes in habitat and dynamic barriers to gene flow makes the seas bordering the Arabian Peninsula one of the most variable marine environments in the world, with a high potential for speciation driven by both neutral and selective factors (DiBattista et al., 2016b). Although the phylogenetic relationships for varieties of A. marina and congeneric species have been reported for other regions (Duke et al., 1998; Nettel et al., 2008; Li et al., 2016), the extensive gray mangrove populations from the Arabian coasts have rarely been included in reported DNA sequence-based analyses (see Duke et al., 1998; Maguire et al., 2000; Li et al., 2016; Al-Qthanin & Alharbi, 2020). The specific drivers and molecular basis of local adaptation and lineage diversification in A. marina remain understudied both in Arabia and across its global distribution.Here, we used the Arabian gray mangrove complex to examine how extreme habitat conditions and heterogeneous spatial settings have shaped genetic diversity at the highly variable edge of the species' range using whole genome and georeferenced environmental data. First, we analyzed patterns of population structure and reconstructed the evolutionary and demographic history of the species in the Arabian Peninsula. Two general competing hypotheses about the evolutionary history of the Arabian mangroves were tested in this study: (i) mangroves from the Red Sea and PAG were extirpated during the glacial cycles of the Pleistocene, followed by a recolonization after the last glacial maximum (LGM); and (ii) mangroves remained within the enclosed seas in glacial refugia during glacial periods, and expanded once sea levels rose. Second, we studied patterns of adaptive variability applying genotype-environment association (GEA) analysis. We used redundancy analysis (RDA) combining environmental and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) data to survey the genome and jointly identify environmental variables and functional genes potentially involved in local adaptation and lineage divergence. Materials and MethodsPopulation samplingWe sampled a total of 200 Avicennia marina individuals from 19 sites across the Arabian Peninsula (var. marina, N = 190), and one site from Australia (var. australasica, N = 10) (Table 1, Fig. 1; Table S1, Supporting Information). Leaf tissue was collected from trees separated by at least 20 meters, and preserved in silica beads for up to ten days before extraction. Geographic coordinates for each tree were recorded. Genomic DNA was extracted from ground leaf tissue using the DNeasy 96 plant kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Genome resequencing and variant calling Illumina paired-end 150 bp libraries with insert size equal to 350 bp were prepared and sequenced in a Novaseq platform. Reads were mapped against a previously published reference genome for A. marina (Friis et al., 2020), SNP calling was carried out with the GATK Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK; McKenna et al., 2010). The resulting dataset consisted of 178 individuals (Table 1; Table S1, Supporting Information) and 15,702,886 biallelic SNPs with a per-individual average coverage of 16.8 and a missing data rate of 0.11. This dataset was further filtered and customized for downstream analyses (See details in Supporting Information).Population structure analyses To explore genome-wide signs of population structure in Arabian mangroves, we first generated a dataset of high quality, independent and putatively neutral SNPs, consisting of a data matrix of 143,900 variable sites and 170 samples (Table S2, Supporting Information). We conducted a principal components analysis (PCA) as implemented the R package SNPRelate (Zheng, 2012). We also examined patterns of population divergence using a sparse non-negative matrix factorization method (SNMF; Frichot et al., 2014). We ran the program five times per K value, with K ranging from 2 to 20. Similarity scores among runs and graphics were computed with CLUMPAK (Kopelman et al. 2015). To further explore patterns of geographic variation in Arabian mangroves, we tested for IBD using the neutral SNP dataset. We computed pairwise Nei's genetic distance values with the hierfstat R package (Goudet et al., 2015). By-sea, pairwise geographic distances were measured based geographic coordinates. A Mantel test was implemented, and significance was computed through 9,999 matrix permutations.Phylogenetic analysisA maximum likelihood phylogeny was produced using the program IQ-TREE (Nguyen et al., 2015). For this analysis, we applied the same filters than for population structure tests, yet retained the Brisbane population from Australia to be used as outgroup (SNP matrix = 29,433, N = 178; Table S2, Supporting Information). The ascertainment bias correction and the generalized time-reversible substitution model were implemented.Population and demographic history analysesWe performed model comparisons under the likelihood framework developed in fastSIMCOAL2 v2.6 (Excoffier et al., 2013) to estimate demographic parameters and date cladogenetic events among mangroves populations, and to test the competing hypotheses of colonization after the LGM versus isolation in glacial refugia in the enclosed seas around Arabia. Informed by the phylogenetic relationships (See results), three sets of models were independently analyzed for (i) the Red Sea, (ii) the PAG plus the Sea of Oman, and (iii) the entire Arabian Peninsula. Three populations were used as lineage representatives for each set of models. The Brisbane population was once again included to calibrate times of divergence, using a coalescence time with the Arabian lineages of 2.7 million years in all models (Li et al., 2016; He et al., 2019; He et al., 2020). Topologies and times of divergence tested in each set of models were analyzed under scenarios of 'strict isolation' and 'isolation with migration'. Overall, six, twelve and two models were compared for the Red Sea, the PAG and the entire Arabian Peninsula, respectively (Table S4, Fig. S1, Supporting Information). As input data we used the folded site frequency spectra (SFS) generated from resequencing data using easySFS (https://github.com/isaacovercast/easySFS). Details about fastSIMCOAL2 analyses, input data, model sketches and parameter files are provided in the Supporting Information.TreeMix v1.13 (Pickrell & Pritchard, 2012) was used to further model historical patterns of gene flow between mangrove populations. The corresponding SNP dataset was built applying the same filters as for the IQ-TREE phylogeny, with the exemption of linkage disequilibrium filters as it can be controlled for in the TreeMix command line (SNP matrix = 797,949; N = 178). We ran TreeMix for 0–15 migrations, grouping SNPs in blocks of 50. Migration edges were plotted until 99.8% of the variance in ancestry between populations was explained by the model (Pickrell & Pritchard, 2012). The consistency of migration edges was evaluated by running TreeMix with 50 total replicates for each added migration edge number using a different, randomly generated seed. Results from the seed that yielded the highest likelihood are reported.Candidate gene identification with genotype-environment association analysisWe used genotype-environment association (GEA) analysis to identify candidate genes evolving under specific environmental pressures, and to estimate their contribution to patterns of local adaptation in mangroves from the Arabian Peninsula. We applied a redundancy analysis approach (Van Den Wollenberg, 1977; Legendre & Legendre, 1998; Borcard et al., 2011) as implemented in the vegan R package (Oksanen et al., 2016). As explanatory variables, we used georeferenced environmental data extracted for the coordinates corresponding to the sampling sites and averaged over populations. The set of explanatory variables included maximum of sea surface salinity and minimum of sea surface temperature averaged over months from the MARSPEC database (Sbrocco & Barber, 2013)]; as well as isothermality and maximum air temperature of the warmest month from the WorldClim database (Hijmans et al., 2005; Fick & Hijmans, 2017)]. As response variables, we used population allele frequencies at each variant position from a dataset of 2,488,560 SNPs (N = 170; Table S2, Supporting Information).Two GEA analyses were implemented: a simple RDA to test for genotype-environment associations between allele frequencies and environmental predictors; and a partial redundancy analysis (pRDA), in which in addition, we controlled for population structure effects. Covariates accounting for population structure consisted of the first two PCs of a PCA based on the allele frequencies matrix after filtering out positions putatively under selection. Following the procedure described in Capblancq et al. (2018), we used the redundancy analyses to identify candidate SNP loci potentially involved in divergent selection, based on Mahalanobis distances estimated between each SNP and the center of the RDA space (Capblancq & Forester, 2021), and applying a p-value threshold < 0.01 with the Bonferroni correction for multiple testing. In addition, to explore differential association patterns of candidate loci at the individual level, we conducted a complementary RDA with the individual genotypes of the SNP outliers as response variables. The first two RDA axes were plotted for visual inspection, as well as pairwise Euclidean distances in the ordination space for all the populations included in the analysis. Further details on implemented GEA analyses and candidate gene identification are provided in the Supporting Information. ResultsPopulation structure and genetic diversity analysesA principal components analysis (PCA) revealed marked levels of population structure. A plot of the first two axes recovered a pattern of clustering that matched the geographic distribution of the sampled populations. Populations from the Red Sea and the PAG clustered apart, showing high overlapping within each biogeographic region. Populations along the coasts of the Arabian Sea also showed marked genetic structure: populations at the west (Salalah and Taqah) grouped together and apart from the remaining genetic clusters, while populations from the Sea of Oman at the east (Shinas and Qurm) clustered close to the PAG. The intermediate population of Filim occupied a central position along the PC2. The third and fourth axes revealed high levels of differentiation within biogeographic regions. Northern and southern basins of the PAG clustered apart along PC3, as well as populations from the Arabian Sea, yet to a lesser extent. Populations of the Red Sea differentiated along PC4 (Fig. 2A).A SNMF analysis recovered variability patterns consistent with the PCA results. At K = 2, populations clustered into two groups separating the Red Sea from the Arabian Sea and the PAG. The plot for K = 3 also revealed the more isolated, adjacent populations from the west of the Arabian Sea (Salalah and Taqah) as a differentiated group, with populations along the northeast Oman coast and into the PAG showing decreasing degrees of shared ancestry. At K = 4, populations from the northern basin of the PAG (Bahrain and Dammam) appeared as a differentiated cluster. At K = 5, populations from northern Red Sea (Duba, Al Wajh 1 and Al Wajh 2) also appeared as a genetically differentiated cluster, yet showing a signal of coancestry decreasing with latitude with proximal populations from the central Red Sea (Al Kharrar and King Abdullah Economic City, hereafter KAEC) and to a lesser extent, Al Lith. In the plot for K = 6, populations from the Sea of Oman, Qurm and Shinas, clustered together with Filim, yet Shinas showed intermediate levels of shared ancestry with the genetic cluster of the southern PAG basin, which included Ras Al Khaimah (hereafter RAK), Umm Al Quawain (hereafter UAQ), Ras Ghurab and Suweihat. At K = 7, populations from southern Red Sea (Al Lith, Farasan Banks 1 and Farasan Banks 2; hereafter FB1 and FB2) clustered apart from the central Red Sea populations, yet Al Lith presented intermediate levels of coancestry with the central Red Sea population KAEC (Fig. 2B).A Mantel test based on selectively neutral, independent SNP loci revealed a significant correlation between by-sea pairwise distances and Nei's genetic distances among sampled populations (r = 0.765, p-value < 10-4; Table S3, Supporting Information).Phylogenetic analysisA maximum likelihood phylogenetic reconstruction showed marked differentiation between and within biogeographic regions, with almost all populations resolved in monophyletic clades with high node support. Arabian mangrove populations grouped in three major, reciprocally monophyletic clades or phylogenetic lineages: the Red Sea lineage (Major Clade I), the southern Arabian Sea lineage (Major Clade II) and the PAG plus the Sea of Oman lineage (Major Clade III). Within the Red Sea's Major Clade I, the phylogenetic analysis revealed a sequence of cladogenetic events consistent with the geographic distribution of the sampled populations, with the first split separating northern (Duba, Al Wajh 1 and Al Wajh 2) and central populations (Al Kharrar and KAEC) from those of the south (Al Lith, FB1 and FB2); adjacent Al Kharrar and KAEC populations from central Red Sea showed little differentiation and grouped into a single clade. The Arabian Sea's Major Clade II encompassed the populations Salalah, Taqah and Filim, all occurring in southern Oman, which appeared as the sister group of the Major Clade III, which includes all Sea of Oman and PAG populations. Major Clade III was further divided into two clades separating the populations of the northern basin of the PAG (Bahrain and Dammam) from those of the southern basin (RAK, UAQ, Ras Ghurab and Suweihat) and the Sea of Oman (Qurm and Shinas). Populations of these two latter subregions, which occur on each side of the Strait of Hormuz, appeared as reciprocally monophyletic, sister groups (Fig. 3).Population and demographic history of the Arabian gray mangroveDemographic models were compared under fastSIMCOAL2. In the Red Sea, the model with the greatest likelihood score (ΔAIC = 318, Fig. 4; Table S4, Supporting Information) revealed a single cladogenetic event for the three analyzed populations under an isolation with migration scenario, and a splitting time dating back to 99,200 years (95% CI = [40,062 – 295,152]), consistent with a process of rapid, simultaneous lineage differentiation. Gene exchange among lineages was particularly high from Al Kharrar in the central Red Sea towards Farasan Banks 2 towards the southern entrance (MIG Al Kharrar → FB2 = 60, 95% CI = [13 – 109] migrants per generation). For the remaining migration bands, 95% confidence intervals varied by orders of magnitude and included values near to zero, revealing little impact of these parameters in the SFS (Fig. 4; Table S5, Supporting Information). In the case of the PAG plus the Sea of Oman, the model that best fitted our data (ΔAIC = 1,615, Fig. 4; Table S4, Supporting Information) also revealed a scenario of simultaneous cladogenesis in isolation with migration dating back 37,760 years (95% CI = [18,950-161,565]), prior to the last glacial maximum. Signs of some gene flow were detected among PAG lineages. While narrower than in the Red Sea estimates, the ranges also included values near to zero in most cases, reducing the certainty in the model (Fig. 4; Table S5, Supporting Information). In the analysis with representatives of each biogeographic region of the Arabian Peninsula, the highest likelihood corresponded once again to the model including migration (ΔAIC = 1,067, Fig. 4; Table S4, Supporting Information), and revealed splitting times of 70,180 years (95% CI = [14,074-161,976]) and 153,140 years (95% CI = [90,714-416,863]) (Fig. 4; Table S5, Supporting Information).Phylogenetic relationships recovered with TreeMix were consistent with the maximum likelihood tree generated with IQ-TREE. A tree model with ten migration events explained up to 99.8% of the SNP variance, revealing signs of both historical and contemporary gene flow among mangrove populations. Two recovered bands of ancestral migration between the outgroup lineage of Brisbane and the northern populations of both the Red Sea and the PAG seemed highly unlikely, so that these results should be interpreted with caution (Fig. 5).Candidate genes and environmental adaptation patterns in Arabian gray mangrovesEnvironmental predictors explained 33.2% of the total genetic variance in the simple RDA (Adjusted R2 = 0.332, p-value < 0.01). The scores of the simple RDA revealed distinct association patterns among biogeographic regions. Red Sea mangroves showed high, negative loading values on RDA axis (RD) 1, while the remaining populations correlated positively with this axis, and heavily in the case of the Sea of Oman and PAG southern basin. In contrast, the Arabian Sea populations showed high negative association values with RD2, while Red Sea and PAG mangroves showed positive association scores along this axis, yet the former with much lower correlation values. In the pRDA, environmental variables explained 6.4%of the total genetic variance after controlling for population structure (Adjusted R2 = 0.064, p-value < 0.01). Scores revealed a more scattered pattern of variation among and within biogeographic regions, where populations from northern PAG showed high positive correlation with pRD1, while populations of the southern PAG and Arabian Sea, as well as from Central Red Sea, showed more limited, negative loading values. In the case of the pRD2, highest loading values corresponded to Qurm, with a positive correlation, and to Ras Ghurab and Suweihat, that correlated negatively (Table S6, Supporting Information).The simple and the partial RDA were jointly used to test for signs of selection applying the method described in Capblancq et al. (2018). The first to axes of the simple RDA accounted for an unadjusted proportion of explained variance equal to 38.8% (R2 = 0.388) out of 48.0% explained by the full model. In turn, the four axes of the partial RDA accounted for 32.3% (R2 = 0.323). Two and four RDA axes from the simple and partial RDA, respectively, were thereby used for candidate loci identification. The analyses revealed 446 genetic variants showing significant associations with one or more of the four environmental predictors in both the RDA and pRDA (NRDA = 3,015; NpRDA = 73,671; Njoint = 446; Fig. S2, Supporting Information). Of the 446 outliers, 70 were located within 31 functionally annotated genes. Reported functions of the identified genes and gene variants in flowering plants potentially relevant for mangroves in this marginal Arabian environment include the following: tolerance to chronic heat stress (MGE2; Hu et al., 2012); drought resistance by stomatal aperture and density regulation, as well as root development (ABIL2; Li et al., 2015); root hydrotropism and drought tolerance; water transport and osmotic pressure control in response to drought and salt stress (PIP; Katsuhara & Hanba, 2008; Mahdieh et al., 2008; Rodríguez-Gamir et al., 2011); cell wall biosynthesis and development (BXL2; Goujon et al., 2003; Zhao et al., 2010); organ growth adjustments in response to stress conditions (MOB1A; Pinosa et al., 2013); Nitrogen uptake and coordination against biotic stress (WRK50; Cheng et al., 2021); response to salinity stress (SQS2; Shirazi et al., 2019); drought tolerance and regulation of reactive oxygen species through sterol biosynthesis (SQE2; Posé et al., 2009); terpenoid metabolism in response to drought stress (4CLL7; Madritsch et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2022); flower bud differentiation in response to light (AI5L5; Yi et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2022); and salt sensitivity in association with the ABA signaling pathway (PUM23; Huang et al., 2018) (Table S7, Supporting Information).To visually explore how adaptive variability is structured at the individual level, we conducted a complementary redundancy analysis based on the individual genotypes of the 446 candidate loci alone. The plot of the first two RDA axes revealed distinctive associations patterns only partially structured by biogeographic region: Populations from the Red Sea differentiated along a gradient loading on maximum air temperature, with northern populations (Duba, Al Wajh 1 and Al Wajh 2) showing high negative correlation values, central Red Sea (Al Lith, FB1 and FB2) clustering close to the origin of coordinates, and southern Red Sea showing positive correlations. Populations from the southwest of the Arabian Sea (Taqah and Salalah) showed a strong, positive GEA signal with isothermality, while correlated negatively with a maximum salinity gradient. In contrast, populations from the Sea of Oman presented low association values and clustered around the origin of coordinates. Populations from the PAG showed an opposite GEA pattern to those of the Arabian Sea, also differentiating along the salinity/isothermality gradient, yet associations were weaker and more scattered in the southern basin than in the northern one (Fig. 6A). Individual Euclidean distances averaged over populations in the RDA ordination space showed general similar trends (Fig. 6B), with within-region, highest differences among association patterns occurring along the Red Sea and outrunning divergence between biogeographic regions (Fig. 6B).

Summary· Plant systems occurring in ecologically heterogeneous and spatially discontinuous habitats provide an ideal opportunity to investigate the relative roles of neutral and selective factors in driving lineage diversification. Here, we analyzed fully sequenced genomes to study diversification mechanisms in the gray mangroves [Avicennia marina (Forssk.) Vierh.] of Arabia, where they occur at the edge of the species’ range and are subject to variable, often extreme, environmental conditions. · We conducted population structure, phylogenomic and demographic analyses to reconstruct the evolutionary history of the species across Arabia. We also applied genotype-environment association methods to study adaptive mechanisms of lineage diversification. · Our analyses revealed marked genetic structure and highly supported clades among and within the seas surrounding the Arabian Peninsula. Inferred divergence times were consistent with recent periods of low marine connectivity during glacial periods, revealing the presence of (cryptic) glacial refugia in the Red Sea and the Persian/Arabian Gulf. Genetic‐environment association analyses revealed high levels of adaptive differentiation, and detected signs of multi-loci local adaptation driven by temperature extremes and hypersalinity. · These results support a process of rapid diversification resulting from the combined effects of historical factors and ecological selection, and reveal mangrove peripheral environments as relevant drivers of lineage diversity. IntroductionLineage diversification in plants involves both neutral and selective factors (Rieseberg & Willis, 2007), and elucidating their relative roles in the process of evolutionary divergence is essential to understand the mechanisms underlying the early stages of speciation (Coyne & Orr, 2004). Evolutionary divergence may result from the accumulation of genetic differences caused by drift in geographic isolation or isolation-by-distance (IBD, Wright, 1943; Wright, 1946), a mode of divergence driven by neutral factors (Mayr, 1954; Mayr, 1963). In turn, geographic variation in environmental conditions can result in divergent selection (Darwin, 1859; Coyne & Orr, 2004), the diversifying process that drives ecological speciation (Nosil, 2012). In ecological speciation models, reproductive barriers arise as a by-product of cumulative, ecologically adaptive changes (Mayr, 1947; Schluter, 2000; Rundle & Nosil, 2005) enabling genome‐wide differentiation at both neutral and selected loci (Nosil et al., 2008; Funk et al., 2011; Shafer & Wolf, 2013; Wang & Bradburd, 2014). Ecological speciation in geographic isolation is theoretically uncontroversial, and considered key in some of the most remarkable radiations in angiosperms (Baldwin & Sanderson, 1998; Hughes & Eastwood, 2006). However, whether environment-driven processes of lineage diversification commonly occur in nature in the absence of long-term isolation and reduced gene flow remains debated in evolution research (Butlin et al., 2008; Fitzpatrick et al., 2008; Papadopulos et al., 2011; Foote, 2018). The interactions between selection and the stochastic effects derived from processes such as founder events, bottlenecks and genetic drift also remain unclear, and difficult to assess in natural systems (Barton & Charlesworth, 1984; Kliber & Eckert, 2005; Crepet & Niklas, 2009).Plant systems occurring in the environmentally heterogeneous and often extreme habitats at species’ range edges are suitable models to investigate questions related to lineage diversification. The environment at the edges of species’ range tends to be stressful and spatially discontinuous, as well as temporally unstable (Lesica & Allendorf, 1995), frequently resulting in dynamic settings of multiple isolated populations subject to strong differential selection. The severe and stochastic character of peripheral environments is hypothesized to generate strong selective interplay between adaptation and neutral processes (Hardie & Hutchings, 2010), providing an ideal opportunity for speciation research. One such system is the gray mangrove populations of the Arabian Peninsula (Avicennia marina var. marina). The gray mangrove has the broadest distribution of any mangrove species (Spalding et al., 2010; Hogarth, 2015; Tomlinson, 2016), extending across the Indian Ocean and into the West Pacific as far as Japan and New Zealand (Fouda & AI-Muharrami, 1996; Sheppard et al., 2010; Spalding et al., 2010; Khalil, 2015). Gray mangroves present several morphological and physiological adaptations to their harsh intertidal habitat (Tomlinson, 2016), which makes them a compelling model for the study of functional genes and biological pathways involved in selection and stress tolerance in plants (Urashi et al., 2013; Xu et al., 2017). The Arabian Peninsula represents one of the northernmost edges of the species’ distribution (Duke, 1991; Spalding et al., 2010; Tomlinson, 2016), as well as a stressful habitat characterized by extreme temperatures, aridity, and often extreme salinity, factors known to be limiting for mangrove growth (Ball, 1988; Sheppard et al., 1992; Lovelock et al., 2016). Arabian marine domains are also environmentally diverse both within, and among, the main water bodies bordering the peninsula, which define three main biogeographic regions: (i) the Red Sea, where the marine system presents opposing gradients of salinity and temperature, with the highest temperature and lowest salinity in the shallow southern basin, while the deeper northern basin has cooler temperatures but high salinity as a result of limited precipitation and high evaporation (Carvalho et al., 2019; Anton et al., 2020); (ii) the Persian/Arabian Gulf (referred to as ‘PAG’ hereafter) to the northeast of the Arabian Peninsula, where populations are subject to arid (<250 mm) to hyper-arid (<100 mm) rainfall regimes, and experience the widest range of air temperatures in the region throughout the year (Böer, 1997; Whitford & Duval, 2019); and (iii) the Arabian Sea (here including the Sea of Oman), which in contrast with former biogeographic regions, has normal oceanic salinity, and summer temperatures that are buffered by cold-water upwelling as a result of the Indian Ocean monsoon, resulting in more moderate environmental conditions (Claereboudt, 2019).The Arabian Peninsula has experienced large fluctuations in spatial and environmental conditions throughout glacio-eustatic cycles that largely impacted the biodiversity of the region, in particular for the enclosed water bodies of the Red Sea and the PAG (DiBattista et al., 2016a). Throughout the last 400,000 years the Red Sea has remained connected to the Indian Ocean, yet cross-sectional area along the Strait of Bab al Mandab that connects these water bodies was, at times of glacial maxima, as low as 2% of that today, resulting in major increases in salinity and temperature within the Red Sea as well as near-complete isolation at times (Lambeck et al., 2011). For several sustained periods during the last two glacial cycles, the minimum channel width connecting the Red Sea to the Arabian Sea was less than 4 km wide and remained narrow whenever the local sea levels were 50 meters below current levels (Lambeck et al., 2011). In contrast, models show that the PAG was nearly completely drained during the peak of the last glaciation until c.a. 14,000 years ago (Lambeck, 1996). A marine incursion into the southern PAG basin started approximately 12,500 years ago, extending towards the northern basin over the following millennia, with the present day PAG shorelines forming just 6,000 years ago (Lambeck, 1996). In contrast, as an open ocean habitat, the Arabian Sea coast has only experienced vertical migration of sea levels during these glacial periods, without geographic isolation.The combination of extreme environmental conditions, differential changes in habitat and dynamic barriers to gene flow makes the seas bordering the Arabian Peninsula one of the most variable marine environments in the world, with a high potential for speciation driven by both neutral and selective factors (DiBattista et al., 2016b). Although the phylogenetic relationships for varieties of A. marina and congeneric species have been reported for other regions (Duke et al., 1998; Nettel et al., 2008; Li et al., 2016), the extensive gray mangrove populations from the Arabian coasts have rarely been included in reported DNA sequence-based analyses (see Duke et al., 1998; Maguire et al., 2000; Li et al., 2016; Al-Qthanin & Alharbi, 2020). The specific drivers and molecular basis of local adaptation and lineage diversification in A. marina remain understudied both in Arabia and across its global distribution.Here, we used the Arabian gray mangrove complex to examine how extreme habitat conditions and heterogeneous spatial settings have shaped genetic diversity at the highly variable edge of the species’ range using whole genome and georeferenced environmental data. First, we analyzed patterns of population structure and reconstructed the evolutionary and demographic history of the species in the Arabian Peninsula. Two general competing hypotheses about the evolutionary history of the Arabian mangroves were tested in this study: (i) mangroves from the Red Sea and PAG were extirpated during the glacial cycles of the Pleistocene, followed by a recolonization after the last glacial maximum (LGM); and (ii) mangroves remained within the enclosed seas in glacial refugia during glacial periods, and expanded once sea levels rose. Second, we studied patterns of adaptive variability applying genotype-environment association (GEA) analysis. We used redundancy analysis (RDA) combining environmental and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) data to survey the genome and jointly identify environmental variables and functional genes potentially involved in local adaptation and lineage divergence. Materials and MethodsPopulation samplingWe sampled a total of 200 Avicennia marina individuals from 19 sites across the Arabian Peninsula (var. marina, N = 190), and one site from Australia (var. australasica, N = 10) (Table 1, Fig. 1; Table S1, Supporting Information). Leaf tissue was collected from trees separated by at least 20 meters, and preserved in silica beads for up to ten days before extraction. Geographic coordinates for each tree were recorded. Genomic DNA was extracted from ground leaf tissue using the DNeasy 96 plant kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Genome resequencing and variant calling Illumina paired-end 150 bp libraries with insert size equal to 350 bp were prepared and sequenced in a Novaseq platform. Reads were mapped against a previously published reference genome for A. marina (Friis et al., 2020), SNP calling was carried out with the GATK Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK; McKenna et al., 2010). The resulting dataset consisted of 178 individuals (Table 1; Table S1, Supporting Information) and 15,702,886 biallelic SNPs with a per-individual average coverage of 16.8 and a missing data rate of 0.11. This dataset was further filtered and customized for downstream analyses (See details in Supporting Information).Population structure analyses To explore genome-wide signs of population structure in Arabian mangroves, we first generated a dataset of high quality, independent and putatively neutral SNPs, consisting of a data matrix of 143,900 variable sites and 170 samples (Table S2, Supporting Information). We conducted a principal components analysis (PCA) as implemented the R package SNPRelate (Zheng, 2012). We also examined patterns of population divergence using a sparse non-negative matrix factorization method (SNMF; Frichot et al., 2014). We ran the program five times per K value, with K ranging from 2 to 20. Similarity scores among runs and graphics were computed with CLUMPAK (Kopelman et al. 2015). To further explore patterns of geographic variation in Arabian mangroves, we tested for IBD using the neutral SNP dataset. We computed pairwise Nei’s genetic distance values with the hierfstat R package (Goudet et al., 2015). By-sea, pairwise geographic distances were measured based geographic coordinates. A Mantel test was implemented, and significance was computed through 9,999 matrix permutations.Phylogenetic analysisA maximum likelihood phylogeny was produced using the program IQ-TREE (Nguyen et al., 2015). For this analysis, we applied the same filters than for population structure tests, yet retained the Brisbane population from Australia to be used as outgroup (SNP matrix = 29,433, N = 178; Table S2, Supporting Information). The ascertainment bias correction and the generalized time-reversible substitution model were implemented.Population and demographic history analysesWe performed model comparisons under the likelihood framework developed in fastSIMCOAL2 v2.6 (Excoffier et al., 2013) to estimate demographic parameters and date cladogenetic events among mangroves populations, and to test the competing hypotheses of colonization after the LGM versus isolation in glacial refugia in the enclosed seas around Arabia. Informed by the phylogenetic relationships (See results), three sets of models were independently analyzed for (i) the Red Sea, (ii) the PAG plus the Sea of Oman, and (iii) the entire Arabian Peninsula. Three populations were used as lineage representatives for each set of models. The Brisbane population was once again included to calibrate times of divergence, using a coalescence time with the Arabian lineages of 2.7 million years in all models (Li et al., 2016; He et al., 2019; He et al., 2020). Topologies and times of divergence tested in each set of models were analyzed under scenarios of ‘strict isolation’ and ‘isolation with migration’. Overall, six, twelve and two models were compared for the Red Sea, the PAG and the entire Arabian Peninsula, respectively (Table S4, Fig. S1, Supporting Information). As input data we used the folded site frequency spectra (SFS) generated from resequencing data using easySFS (https://github.com/isaacovercast/easySFS). Details about fastSIMCOAL2 analyses, input data, model sketches and parameter files are provided in the Supporting Information.TreeMix v1.13 (Pickrell & Pritchard, 2012) was used to further model historical patterns of gene flow between mangrove populations. The corresponding SNP dataset was built applying the same filters as for the IQ-TREE phylogeny, with the exemption of linkage disequilibrium filters as it can be controlled for in the TreeMix command line (SNP matrix = 797,949; N = 178). We ran TreeMix for 0–15 migrations, grouping SNPs in blocks of 50. Migration edges were plotted until 99.8% of the variance in ancestry between populations was explained by the model (Pickrell & Pritchard, 2012). The consistency of migration edges was evaluated by running TreeMix with 50 total replicates for each added migration edge number using a different, randomly generated seed. Results from the seed that yielded the highest likelihood are reported.Candidate gene identification with genotype-environment association analysisWe used genotype-environment association (GEA) analysis to identify candidate genes evolving under specific environmental pressures, and to estimate their contribution to patterns of local adaptation in mangroves from the Arabian Peninsula. We applied a redundancy analysis approach (Van Den Wollenberg, 1977; Legendre & Legendre, 1998; Borcard et al., 2011) as implemented in the vegan R package (Oksanen et al., 2016). As explanatory variables, we used georeferenced environmental data extracted for the coordinates corresponding to the sampling sites and averaged over populations. The set of explanatory variables included maximum of sea surface salinity and minimum of sea surface temperature averaged over months from the MARSPEC database (Sbrocco & Barber, 2013)]; as well as isothermality and maximum air temperature of the warmest month from the WorldClim database (Hijmans et al., 2005; Fick & Hijmans, 2017)]. As response variables, we used population allele frequencies at each variant position from a dataset of 2,488,560 SNPs (N = 170; Table S2, Supporting Information).Two GEA analyses were implemented: a simple RDA to test for genotype-environment associations between allele frequencies and environmental predictors; and a partial redundancy analysis (pRDA), in which in addition, we controlled for population structure effects. Covariates accounting for population structure consisted of the first two PCs of a PCA based on the allele frequencies matrix after filtering out positions putatively under selection. Following the procedure described in Capblancq et al. (2018), we used the redundancy analyses to identify candidate SNP loci potentially involved in divergent selection, based on Mahalanobis distances estimated between each SNP and the center of the RDA space (Capblancq & Forester, 2021), and applying a p-value threshold < 0.01 with the Bonferroni correction for multiple testing. In addition, to explore differential association patterns of candidate loci at the individual level, we conducted a complementary RDA with the individual genotypes of the SNP outliers as response variables. The first two RDA axes were plotted for visual inspection, as well as pairwise Euclidean distances in the ordination space for all the populations included in the analysis. Further details on implemented GEA analyses and candidate gene identification are provided in the Supporting Information. ResultsPopulation structure and genetic diversity analysesA principal components analysis (PCA) revealed marked levels of population structure. A plot of the first two axes recovered a pattern of clustering that matched the geographic distribution of the sampled populations. Populations from the Red Sea and the PAG clustered apart, showing high overlapping within each biogeographic region. Populations along the coasts of the Arabian Sea also showed marked genetic structure: populations at the west (Salalah and Taqah) grouped together and apart from the remaining genetic clusters, while populations from the Sea of Oman at the east (Shinas and Qurm) clustered close to the PAG. The intermediate population of Filim occupied a central position along the PC2. The third and fourth axes revealed high levels of differentiation within biogeographic regions. Northern and southern basins of the PAG clustered apart along PC3, as well as populations from the Arabian Sea, yet to a lesser extent. Populations of the Red Sea differentiated along PC4 (Fig. 2A).A SNMF analysis recovered variability patterns consistent with the PCA results. At K = 2, populations clustered into two groups separating the Red Sea from the Arabian Sea and the PAG. The plot for K = 3 also revealed the more isolated, adjacent populations from the west of the Arabian Sea (Salalah and Taqah) as a differentiated group, with populations along the northeast Oman coast and into the PAG showing decreasing degrees of shared ancestry. At K = 4, populations from the northern basin of the PAG (Bahrain and Dammam) appeared as a differentiated cluster. At K = 5, populations from northern Red Sea (Duba, Al Wajh 1 and Al Wajh 2) also appeared as a genetically differentiated cluster, yet showing a signal of coancestry decreasing with latitude with proximal populations from the central Red Sea (Al Kharrar and King Abdullah Economic City, hereafter KAEC) and to a lesser extent, Al Lith. In the plot for K = 6, populations from the Sea of Oman, Qurm and Shinas, clustered together with Filim, yet Shinas showed intermediate levels of shared ancestry with the genetic cluster of the southern PAG basin, which included Ras Al Khaimah (hereafter RAK), Umm Al Quawain (hereafter UAQ), Ras Ghurab and Suweihat. At K = 7, populations from southern Red Sea (Al Lith, Farasan Banks 1 and Farasan Banks 2; hereafter FB1 and FB2) clustered apart from the central Red Sea populations, yet Al Lith presented intermediate levels of coancestry with the central Red Sea population KAEC (Fig. 2B).A Mantel test based on selectively neutral, independent SNP loci revealed a significant correlation between by-sea pairwise distances and Nei’s genetic distances among sampled populations (r = 0.765, p-value < 10-4; Table S3, Supporting Information).Phylogenetic analysisA maximum likelihood phylogenetic reconstruction showed marked differentiation between and within biogeographic regions, with almost all populations resolved in monophyletic clades with high node support. Arabian mangrove populations grouped in three major, reciprocally monophyletic clades or phylogenetic lineages: the Red Sea lineage (Major Clade I), the southern Arabian Sea lineage (Major Clade II) and the PAG plus the Sea of Oman lineage (Major Clade III). Within the Red Sea’s Major Clade I, the phylogenetic analysis revealed a sequence of cladogenetic events consistent with the geographic distribution of the sampled populations, with the first split separating northern (Duba, Al Wajh 1 and Al Wajh 2) and central populations (Al Kharrar and KAEC) from those of the south (Al Lith, FB1 and FB2); adjacent Al Kharrar and KAEC populations from central Red Sea showed little differentiation and grouped into a single clade. The Arabian Sea’s Major Clade II encompassed the populations Salalah, Taqah and Filim, all occurring in southern Oman, which appeared as the sister group of the Major Clade III, which includes all Sea of Oman and PAG populations. Major Clade III was further divided into two clades separating the populations of the northern basin of the PAG (Bahrain and Dammam) from those of the southern basin (RAK, UAQ, Ras Ghurab and Suweihat) and the Sea of Oman (Qurm and Shinas). Populations of these two latter subregions, which occur on each side of the Strait of Hormuz, appeared as reciprocally monophyletic, sister groups (Fig. 3).Population and demographic history of the Arabian gray mangroveDemographic models were compared under fastSIMCOAL2. In the Red Sea, the model with the greatest likelihood score (ΔAIC = 318, Fig. 4; Table S4, Supporting Information) revealed a single cladogenetic event for the three analyzed populations under an isolation with migration scenario, and a splitting time dating back to 99,200 years (95% CI = [40,062 – 295,152]), consistent with a process of rapid, simultaneous lineage differentiation. Gene exchange among lineages was particularly high from Al Kharrar in the central Red Sea towards Farasan Banks 2 towards the southern entrance (MIG Al Kharrar → FB2 = 60, 95% CI = [13 – 109] migrants per generation). For the remaining migration bands, 95% confidence intervals varied by orders of magnitude and included values near to zero, revealing little impact of these parameters in the SFS (Fig. 4; Table S5, Supporting Information). In the case of the PAG plus the Sea of Oman, the model that best fitted our data (ΔAIC = 1,615, Fig. 4; Table S4, Supporting Information) also revealed a scenario of simultaneous cladogenesis in isolation with migration dating back 37,760 years (95% CI = [18,950-161,565]), prior to the last glacial maximum. Signs of some gene flow were detected among PAG lineages. While narrower than in the Red Sea estimates, the ranges also included values near to zero in most cases, reducing the certainty in the model (Fig. 4; Table S5, Supporting Information). In the analysis with representatives of each biogeographic region of the Arabian Peninsula, the highest likelihood corresponded once again to the model including migration (ΔAIC = 1,067, Fig. 4; Table S4, Supporting Information), and revealed splitting times of 70,180 years (95% CI = [14,074-161,976]) and 153,140 years (95% CI = [90,714-416,863]) (Fig. 4; Table S5, Supporting Information).Phylogenetic relationships recovered with TreeMix were consistent with the maximum likelihood tree generated with IQ-TREE. A tree model with ten migration events explained up to 99.8% of the SNP variance, revealing signs of both historical and contemporary gene flow among mangrove populations. Two recovered bands of ancestral migration between the outgroup lineage of Brisbane and the northern populations of both the Red Sea and the PAG seemed highly unlikely, so that these results should be interpreted with caution (Fig. 5).Candidate genes and environmental adaptation patterns in Arabian gray mangrovesEnvironmental predictors explained 33.2% of the total genetic variance in the simple RDA (Adjusted R2 = 0.332, p-value < 0.01). The scores of the simple RDA revealed distinct association patterns among biogeographic regions. Red Sea mangroves showed high, negative loading values on RDA axis (RD) 1, while the remaining populations correlated positively with this axis, and heavily in the case of the Sea of Oman and PAG southern basin. In contrast, the Arabian Sea populations showed high negative association values with RD2, while Red Sea and PAG mangroves showed positive association scores along this axis, yet the former with much lower correlation values. In the pRDA, environmental variables explained 6.4%of the total genetic variance after controlling for population structure (Adjusted R2 = 0.064, p-value < 0.01). Scores revealed a more scattered pattern of variation among and within biogeographic regions, where populations from northern PAG showed high positive correlation with pRD1, while populations of the southern PAG and Arabian Sea, as well as from Central Red Sea, showed more limited, negative loading values. In the case of the pRD2, highest loading values corresponded to Qurm, with a positive correlation, and to Ras Ghurab and Suweihat, that correlated negatively (Table S6, Supporting Information).The simple and the partial RDA were jointly used to test for signs of selection applying the method described in Capblancq et al. (2018). The first to axes of the simple RDA accounted for an unadjusted proportion of explained variance equal to 38.8% (R2 = 0.388) out of 48.0% explained by the full model. In turn, the four axes of the partial RDA accounted for 32.3% (R2 = 0.323). Two and four RDA axes from the simple and partial RDA, respectively, were thereby used for candidate loci identification. The analyses revealed 446 genetic variants showing significant associations with one or more of the four environmental predictors in both the RDA and pRDA (NRDA = 3,015; NpRDA = 73,671; Njoint = 446; Fig. S2, Supporting Information). Of the 446 outliers, 70 were located within 31 functionally annotated genes. Reported functions of the identified genes and gene variants in flowering plants potentially relevant for mangroves in this marginal Arabian environment include the following: tolerance to chronic heat stress (MGE2; Hu et al., 2012); drought resistance by stomatal aperture and density regulation, as well as root development (ABIL2; Li et al., 2015); root hydrotropism and drought tolerance; water transport and osmotic pressure control in response to drought and salt stress (PIP; Katsuhara & Hanba, 2008; Mahdieh et al., 2008; Rodríguez-Gamir et al., 2011); cell wall biosynthesis and development (BXL2; Goujon et al., 2003; Zhao et al., 2010); organ growth adjustments in response to stress conditions (MOB1A; Pinosa et al., 2013); Nitrogen uptake and coordination against biotic stress (WRK50; Cheng et al., 2021); response to salinity stress (SQS2; Shirazi et al., 2019); drought tolerance and regulation of reactive oxygen species through sterol biosynthesis (SQE2; Posé et al., 2009); terpenoid metabolism in response to drought stress (4CLL7; Madritsch et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2022); flower bud differentiation in response to light (AI5L5; Yi et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2022); and salt sensitivity in association with the ABA signaling pathway (PUM23; Huang et al., 2018) (Table S7, Supporting Information).To visually explore how adaptive variability is structured at the individual level, we conducted a complementary redundancy analysis based on the individual genotypes of the 446 candidate loci alone. The plot of the first two RDA axes revealed distinctive associations patterns only partially structured by biogeographic region: Populations from the Red Sea differentiated along a gradient loading on maximum air temperature, with northern populations (Duba, Al Wajh 1 and Al Wajh 2) showing high negative correlation values, central Red Sea (Al Lith, FB1 and FB2) clustering close to the origin of coordinates, and southern Red Sea showing positive correlations. Populations from the southwest of the Arabian Sea (Taqah and Salalah) showed a strong, positive GEA signal with isothermality, while correlated negatively with a maximum salinity gradient. In contrast, populations from the Sea of Oman presented low association values and clustered around the origin of coordinates. Populations from the PAG showed an opposite GEA pattern to those of the Arabian Sea, also differentiating along the salinity/isothermality gradient, yet associations were weaker and more scattered in the southern basin than in the northern one (Fig. 6A).

Despite their ecological and economic importance, these species are declining because of human impact. This decline has driven the need for monitoring and mapping to estimate the overall health and dynamics of seagrasses in coastal environments, often based on underwater images. However, seagrass detection from underwater digital images is not a trivial task; it requires taxonomic expertise and is time-consuming and expensive. Recently automatic approaches based on deep learning have revolutionised object detection performance in many computer vision applications, and there has been interest in applying this to automated seagrass detection from imagery. Deep learning–based techniques reduce the need for hardcore feature extraction by domain experts which is required in machine learning-based techniques. This study presents a YOLOv5-based one-stage detector and an EfficientDetD7–based two-stage detector for detecting seagrass, in this case, Halophila ovalis, one of the most widely distributed seagrass species. The EfficientDet-D7–based seagrass detector achieves the highest mAP of 0.484 on the ECUHO-2 dataset and mAP of 0.354 on the ECUHO-1 dataset, which are about 7% and 5% better than the state-of-the-art Halophila ovalis detection performance on those datasets, respectively. The proposed YOLOv5-based detector achieves an average inference time of 0.077 s and 0.043 s respectively which are much lower than the state-of-the-art approach on the same datasets.","",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoinf.2023.102047,"",,
rayyan-220259162,Deep learning of systematic sea ice model errors from data assimilation increments,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Data assimilation is often viewed as a framework for correcting short-term error growth in dynamical climate model forecasts. When viewed on the time scales of climate however, these short-term corrections, or analysis increments, closely mirror the systematic bias patterns of the dynamical model. In this work, we show that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) can be used to learn a&amp;#160;mapping from model state variables to analysis increments, thus promoting the feasibility of a data-driven model parameterization which predicts state-dependent model errors. We showcase this problem using an ice-ocean data assimilation system within the fully coupled Seamless system for Prediction and EArth system Research (SPEAR) model at the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL), which assimilates satellite observations of sea ice concentration. The CNN then takes inputs of data assimilation forecast states and tendencies, and makes predictions of the corresponding sea ice concentration increments. Specifically, the inputs are sea ice concentration, sea-surface temperature, ice velocities, ice thickness, net shortwave radiation, ice-surface skin temperature, and sea-surface salinity. We show that the CNN is able to make skilful predictions of the increments, particularly between December and February in both the Arctic and Antarctic, with average daily spatial pattern correlations of 0.72 and 0.79, respectively. Initial investigation of implementation of the CNN into the fully coupled SPEAR model shows that the CNN can reduce biases in retrospective seasonal sea ice forecasts by emulating a data assimilation system, further suggesting that systematic sea ice biases could be reduced in a free-running climate simulation.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu23-10351,"",,
rayyan-220259461,Global High-Resolution Random Forest Regression Maps of Ocean Heat Content Anomalies Using In Situ and Satellite Data,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract The ocean, with its low albedo and vast thermal inertia, plays key roles in the climate system, including absorbing massive amounts of heat as atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations rise. While the Argo array of profiling floats has vastly improved sampling of ocean temperature in the upper half of the global ocean volume since the mid-2000s, they are not sufficient in number to resolve eddy scales in the oceans. However, satellite sea surface temperature (SST) and sea surface height (SSH) measurements do resolve these scales. Here we use random forest regressions to map ocean heat content anomalies (OHCA) using in situ training data from Argo and other sources on a 7-day × 1/4° × 1/4° grid with latitude, longitude, time, SSH, and SST as predictors. The maps display substantial patterns on eddy scales, resolving variations of ocean currents and fronts. During the well-sampled Argo period, global integrals of these maps reduce noise relative to estimates based on objective mapping of in situ data alone by roughly a factor of 3 when compared to time series of CERES (satellite data) top-of-the-atmosphere energy flux measurements and improve correlations of anomalies with CERES on annual time scales. Prior to and early on in the Argo period, when in situ data were sparser, global integrals of these maps retain low variance, and do not relax back to a climatological mean, avoiding potential deficiencies of various methods for infilling data-sparse regions with objective maps by exploiting temporal and spatial patterns of OHCA and its correlations with SST and SSH. Significance Statement We use a simple machine learning technique to improve maps of subsurface ocean warming by exploiting the relationships between subsurface ocean temperature both sea surface temperature and sea level. Mapping ocean warming is important because it contributes to sea level rise through thermal expansion; impacts marine life through marine heatwaves and changes in mixing, oxygen, and carbon dioxide levels; increases energy available to tropical cyclones; and stores most of the energy building up in Earth’s climate system owing to the accumulation of anthropogenic greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Our new estimates generally have lower noise energy and higher correlations than other products when compared with global energy fluxes at the top of the atmosphere measured by satellite.","",https://doi.org/10.1175/jtech-d-22-0058.1,"",,

rayyan-220260159,Parameterizing Vertical Mixing Coefficients in the Ocean Surface Boundary Layer using Neural Networks,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Vertical mixing parameterizations in ocean models are formulated on the basis of the physical principles that govern turbulent mixing. However, many parameterizations include ad hoc components that are not well constrained by theory or data. One such component is the eddy diffusivity model, where vertical turbulent fluxes of a quantity are parameterized from a variable eddy diffusion coefficient and the mean vertical gradient of the quantity. In this work, we improve a parameterization of vertical mixing in the ocean surface boundary layer by enhancing its eddy diffusivity model using data-driven methods, specifically neural networks. The neural networks are designed to take extrinsic and intrinsic forcing parameters as input to predict the eddy diffusivity profile and are trained using output data from a second moment closure turbulent mixing scheme. The modified vertical mixing scheme predicts the eddy diffusivity profile through online inference of neural networks and maintains the conservation principles of the standard ocean model equations, which is particularly important for its targeted use in climate simulations. We describe the development and stable implementation of neural networks in an ocean general circulation model and demonstrate that the enhanced scheme outperforms its predecessor by reducing biases in the mixed-layer depth and upper ocean stratification. Our results demonstrate the potential for data-driven physics-aware parameterizations to improve global climate models.","",https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2306.09045,"",,
rayyan-220260470,Space technology: A powerful tool for safeguarding world heritage,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"The Convention Concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage (WHC), adopted by United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) on November 16, 1972, aims to ensure the identification, protection, conservation, presentation, and transmission to future generations of the world's cultural and natural heritage. The WHC works toward these goals by emphasizing the Outstanding Universal Value (OUV) of heritage sites and the unique contribution such places can make to conservation and human development agendas.1UNESCO, United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization. Operational Guidelines for the Implementation of the World Heritage Convention. Paris, France: UNESCO, 2021.Google Scholar As of the end of January 2023, the WHC has been signed by 194 state parties, covering 1,157 sites (including 900 cultural, 218 natural, and 39 mixed properties), 55 of which are considered to be in danger. These sites, totaling an area of more than 370 million hectares are designated as World Heritage (WH) sites (https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/). WH sites have played a significant role in the sustainable development of society globally and helped effectively maintain and preserve the cultural diversity and global biodiversity of the Earth.2Luo L. Wang X. Guo H. Contribution of UNESCO designated sites to the achievement of sustainable development goals.Innovation. 2022; 3100227Google Scholar However, WH sites around the world are experiencing significant impacts caused, in large part, by increasing anthropogenic threats (such as the rapid spread of urban sprawl, deforestation, resource overexploitation, air pollution, armed conflict, excessive tourism, and poor management).3Allan J.R. Venter O. Maxwell S. et al.Recent increases in human pressure and forest loss threaten many Natural World Heritage Sites.Biol. Conserv. 2017; 206: 47-55Crossref Scopus (104) Google Scholar There is also a range of overarching, long-term global challenges posed by climate change, extreme and severe weather events and geological hazards.4Vousdoukas M.I. Clarke J. Ranasinghe R. et al.African heritage sites threatened as sea-level rise accelerates.Nat. Clim. Chang. 2022; 12: 256-262Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar These threats, anthropogenic or otherwise, have put an unprecedented amount of pressure on the protection of both cultural and natural properties at the heritage sites. There is no conclusive solution to effectively protect heritage sties in the foreseeable future, and the public is becoming increasingly conscious about the negative impacts some anthropogenic activities have brought to heritage sites, exposing them to various risks for irreversible damage and loss. In light of this predicament, UNESCO, alongside its conservation partners, has been actively calling for the use of non-intrusive space technology (ST) to better evaluate and understand the detrimental factors surrounding WH sites and devise effective plans to mitigate negative impacts on OUV through the accurate identification, documentation, monitoring, and understanding of WH sites and their changes across large spatiotemporal scales. For this commentary, ST refers mainly to remote sensing (RS) based on Earth observation (EO) from space, as well as other geospatial information technologies such as geographic information systems (GIS) and global navigation satellite systems (GNSS). Even though ST was not developed intentionally for WH protection, it provides an advanced set of innovative and flexible tools that integrate scientific research into heritage science, which forms the evidential base to support measures for the protection of WH sites. ST also opens up paths of methodological innovation to facilitate future conservation of cultural and natural properties with new paradigms. On the basis of a half-century review of the applications of ST in the field of WH, we find that ST has effectively reshaped our means for WH conservation in four major domains of application: mapping, monitoring, modeling, and management of WH sites (Figure 1A). ST, as an objective and reliable ""eye"" from above for heritage experts, has enabled detailed mapping of heritages at various scales. This application commonly involves the acquisition and updatable analysis of multimodal datasets, combined with near real-time survey and investigation of WH sites and their contextual environments. ST is also an invaluable tool in identifying and designating potential new WH sites. The widespread integration of ST has played a crucial role in UNESCO's routine monitoring and emergency monitoring of cultural and natural heritages as a countermeasure to the challenges presented by global change. In particular, ST has made major contributions to fine-grained monitoring at very high resolutions in time and space and in assessing change caused by natural and/or anthropogenic processes. The combined application of RS, GIS, and augmented reality has facilitated the production of three-dimensional (3D) modeling of WH sites. In addition, photogrammetry and laser scanning can be used in WH surveys for generating 3D documentation of cultural and natural properties. Heritage information models of some popular WH sites have already been actively used in the fields of architecture study and digital ecology. The ability of ST to contribute to the conservation, planning, and management of WH sites has already been commonly used in the following domains: the definition of authenticity and integrity (AI), the mapping of OUV attributes of cultural and natural assets, the development and maintenance of heritage databases, 3D modeling and digital reconstruction, and informing WH management for sustainable development. The UNESCO WHC refers to its ""strategic objectives"" as the ""5 C's"": credibility, conservation, capacity building, communication, and communities.1UNESCO, United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization. Operational Guidelines for the Implementation of the World Heritage Convention. Paris, France: UNESCO, 2021.Google Scholar Here, we propose five key contributions (""5 D's"") of ST for conservation work involving WH sites (see Figure 1B): data, driver, discovery, digital transformation, and decision support. ST and the 5 D's, together with the WHC, constitute the ""turbine model"" for safeguarding WH that is proposed in this commentary and will assist in achieving the 5 C's over the next 50 years. By providing massive multi-source data, ST plays a crucial role in the WH governance chain. Archived data together with ongoing data acquisition record changes at WH sites and provide evidence for their conservation. The data collected through ST will, in turn, serve as an invaluable store of not only raw observations but also derivative products that can be extracted from imagery.5Levin N. Ali S. Crandall D. et al.World Heritage in danger: big data and remote sensing can help protect sites in conflict zones.Global Environ. Change. 2019; 55: 97-104Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar As a result of this data mechanism, ST will be able to mitigate the problem of lacunae in WH data by offering global coverage and consistency. ST is driving a revolution to become a new paradigm of WH protection. It provides advanced tools, such as RS data processing and GIS spatial analysis powered by machine learning, which can be used for dynamic monitoring and spatiotemporal analysis of changes that are occurring at WH sites. From this enhanced monitoring method, WH specialists and managers are empowered with the tools to monitor change over time and to assess whether conservation efforts to mitigate the impacts of natural and anthropogenic processes are contributing to positive outcomes toward sustainability. ST plays a key role in aiding frontier research across multiple disciplines related to heritage science. Scientific discoveries based on the use of new geospatial technologies and big EO data can be applied to the quantitative assessment of the state of WH protection. They can also be used to support deepened multidimensional interpretations of the OUV of WH sites, to guide the sustainable use of WH, and to improve accessibility so that all stakeholders may obtain unbiased and open information, thus increasing the credibility of WH as a global brand. ST provides a means of digital transformation that can be used for identifying, understanding, visualizing, presenting, and interpreting WH sites and their OUV in the digital space. In the future, ST will promote the transformation of WH protection through studies such as tangible heritage, digitalized heritage, or both. GIS-aided digital transformation will greatly improve the quality and efficiency of global communication and the dissemination of information related to WH sites, promoting public awareness of protection concepts and smoothing the implementation of actions. ST is becoming an invaluable tool to provide decision-making support along the entire chain of WH governance, from mapping to monitoring, modeling, and management. ST-based solutions could offer spatial intelligence to inform strategic decision making for multiple stakeholders, including local communities, WH sectors, institutions, and organizations. It offers an innovative path for capacity building and capacity enhancement in relation to the global governance of WH. These solutions are delivered in numerous ways, including databases, technologies, protocols, visualization platforms, and analytical systems. WH is under the influence of a wide array of anthropogenic and natural processes, giving the heritage bodies and national and international organizations promoting the preservation of WH sites an unprecedented opportunity to use science, technology, and innovation, including ST, to experiment innovative solutions and promote the role of WH in achieving sustainable development. Given that natural and anthropogenic challenges can present similar issues in various regions across the globe, it is evident that sharing knowledge and expertise, as well as developing collective strategies to leverage ST, while tailoring our methods to local circumstances, will be fundamental in developing a global approach for WH that is successful in the long run. The past 50 years of applications have resulted in continuous innovation in the development of ST to become powerful, cutting-edge tools for use in heritage documentation, monitoring, assessment and protection, and sustainable development. Although the progress is promising, we must underscore that relying solely on ST is insufficient; the greatest benefits are achieved by integrating ST with a variety of disciplines, such as management, economics, sustainability, sociology, education, ethics, politics, law, art, and aesthetics. Through closer and sustained engagement with a broader cross-section of society and local communities, ST can contribute to opening new horizons for WH protection over the course of the twenty-first century.

Efforts to quantify marine pollution are often conducted with sparse and expensive beach surveys, which are difficult to conduct on a large scale. Here, remote sensing can provide reliable estimates of plastic pollution by regularly monitoring and detecting marine debris in coastal areas. Medium-resolution satellite data of coastal areas is readily available and can be leveraged to detect aggregations of marine debris containing plastic litter. In this work, we present a detector for marine debris built on a deep segmentation model that outputs a probability for marine debris at the pixel level. We train this detector with a combination of annotated datasets of marine debris and evaluate it on specifically selected test sites where it is highly probable that plastic pollution is present in the detected marine debris. We demonstrate quantitatively and qualitatively that a deep learning model trained on this dataset issued from multiple sources outperforms existing detection models trained on previous datasets by a large margin. Our experiments show, consistent with the principles of data-centric AI, that this performance is due to our particular dataset design with extensive sampling of negative examples and label refinements rather than depending on the particular deep learning model.

Recent shifts in climate patterns and intensified human–forest interactions have led to an increase in the incidence of wildfires. These fires are characterized by their extensive coverage, higher frequency, and prolonged duration, rendering them increasingly destructive. To mitigate the impact of wildfires on climate change, ecosystems, and biodiversity, it is imperative to conduct systematic monitoring of wildfire progression and evaluate their environmental repercussions on a global scale. Satellite remote sensing is a powerful tool, offering precise and timely data on terrestrial changes, and has been extensively utilized for wildfire identification, tracking, and impact assessment at both local and regional levels. The Canada Centre for Mapping and Earth Observation, in collaboration with the Canadian Forest Service, has developed a comprehensive National Burned Area Composite (NBAC). This composite serves as a benchmark for curating a bi-temporal multi-source satellite image dataset for change detection, compiled from the archives of Sentinel-2, Sentinel-1, and ALOS-2 PALSAR-2. To our knowledge, this dataset is the inaugural large-scale, multi-source, and multi-frequency satellite image dataset with 20 m spatial resolution for wildfire mapping, monitoring, and evaluation. It harbors significant potential for enhancing wildfire management strategies, building upon the profound advancements in deep learning that have contributed to the field of remote sensing. Based on our curated dataset, which encompasses major wildfire events in Canada, we conducted a systematic evaluation of the capability of multi-source satellite earth observation data in identifying wildfire-burned areas using statistical analysis and deep learning. Our analysis compares the difference between burned and unburned areas using post-event observation solely or bi-temporal (pre- and post-event) observations across diverse land cover types. We demonstrate that optical satellite data yield higher separability than C-Band and L-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), which exhibit considerable overlap in burned and unburned sample distribution, as evidenced by SAR-based boxplots. With U-Net, we further explore how different input channels influence the detection accuracy. Our findings reveal that deep neural networks enhance SAR’s performance in mapping burned areas. Notably, C-Band SAR shows a higher dependency on pre-event data than L-Band SAR for effective detection. A comparative analysis of U-Net and its variants indicates that U-Net works best with single-sensor data, while the late fusion architecture marginally surpasses others in the fusion of optical and SAR data. Accuracy across sensors is highest in closed forests, with sequentially lower performance in open forests, shrubs, and grasslands. Future work will extend the data from both spatial and temporal dimensions to encompass varied vegetation types and climate zones, furthering our understanding of multi-source and multi-frequency satellite remote sensing capabilities in wildfire detection and monitoring.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/rs16030556,"",,
rayyan-220264000,"CMEMS-LSCE: a global, 0.25°, monthly reconstruction of the surface ocean carbonate system",,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract. Observation-based data reconstructions of global surface ocean carbonate system variables play an essential role in monitoring the recent status of ocean carbon uptake and ocean acidification, as well as their impacts on marine organisms and ecosystems. So far, ongoing efforts are directed towards exploring new approaches to describe the complete marine carbonate system and to better recover its fine-scale features. In this respect, our research activities within the Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service (CMEMS) aim to develop a sustainable production chain of observation-derived global ocean carbonate system datasets at high space–time resolutions. As the start of the long-term objective, this study introduces a new global 0.25∘ monthly reconstruction, namely CMEMS-LSCE (Laboratoire des Sciences du Climat et de l'Environnement) for the period 1985–2021. The CMEMS-LSCE reconstruction derives datasets of six carbonate system variables, including surface ocean partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2), total alkalinity (AT), total dissolved inorganic carbon (CT), surface ocean pH, and saturation states with respect to aragonite (Ωar) and calcite (Ωca). Reconstructing pCO2 relies on an ensemble of neural network models mapping gridded observation-based data provided by the Surface Ocean CO2 ATlas (SOCAT). Surface ocean AT is estimated with a multiple-linear-regression approach, and the remaining carbonate variables are resolved by CO2 system speciation given the reconstructed pCO2 and AT; 1σ uncertainty associated with these estimates is also provided. Here, σ stands for either the ensemble standard deviation of pCO2 estimates or the total uncertainty for each of the five other variables propagated through the processing chain with input data uncertainty. We demonstrate that the 0.25∘ resolution pCO2 product outperforms a coarser spatial resolution (1∘) thanks to higher data coverage nearshore and a better description of horizontal and temporal variations in pCO2 across diverse ocean basins, particularly in the coastal–open-ocean continuum. Product qualification with observation-based data confirms reliable reconstructions with root-mean-square deviation from observations of less than 8 %, 4 %, and 1 % relative to the global mean of pCO2, AT (CT), and pH. The global average 1σ uncertainty is below 5 % and 8 % for pCO2 and Ωar (Ωca), 2 % for AT and CT, and 0.4 % for pH relative to their global mean values. Both model–observation misfit and model uncertainty indicate that coastal data reproduction still needs further improvement, wherein high temporal and horizontal gradients of carbonate variables and representative uncertainty from data sampling would be taken into account as a priority. This study also presents a potential use case of the CMEMS-LSCE carbonate data product in tracking the recent state of ocean acidification. The data associated with this study are available at https://doi.org/10.14768/a2f0891b-763a-49e9-af1b-78ed78b16982 (Chau et al., 2023).","",https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-16-121-2024,"",,
rayyan-220264772,Uncovering mangrove range limits using very high resolution satellite imagery to detect fine‐scale mangrove and saltmarsh habitats in dynamic coastal ecotones,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract Mangroves are important ecosystems for coastal biodiversity, resilience and carbon dynamics that are being threatened globally by human pressures and the impacts of climate change. Yet, at several geographic range limits in tropical–temperate transition zones, mangrove ecosystems are expanding poleward in response to changing macroclimatic drivers. Mangroves near range limits often grow to smaller statures and form dynamic, patchy distributions with other coastal habitats, which are difficult to map using moderate‐resolution (30‐m) satellite imagery. As a result, many of these mangrove areas are missing in global distribution maps. To better map small, scrub mangroves, we tested Landsat (30‐m) and Sentinel (10‐m) against very high resolution (VHR) Planet (3‐m) and WorldView (1.8‐m) imagery and assessed the accuracy of machine learning classification approaches in discerning current (2022) mangrove and saltmarsh from other coastal habitats in a rapidly changing ecotone along the east coast of Florida, USA. Our aim is to (1) quantify the mappable differences in landscape composition and complexity, class dominance and spatial properties of mangrove and saltmarsh patches due to image resolution; and (2) to resolve mapping uncertainties in the region. We found that the ability of Landsat to map mangrove distributions at the leading range edge was hampered by the size and extent of mangrove stands being too small for detection (50% accuracy). WorldView was the most successful in discerning mangroves from other wetland habitats (84% accuracy), closely followed by Planet (82%) and Sentinel (81%). With WorldView, we detected 800 ha of mangroves within the Florida range‐limit study area, 35% more mangroves than were detected with Planet, 114% more than Sentinel and 537% more than Landsat. Higher‐resolution imagery helped reveal additional variability in landscape metrics quantifying diversity, spatial configuration and connectedness among mangrove and saltmarsh habitats at the landscape, class and patch scales. Overall, VHR satellite imagery improved our ability to map mangroves at range limits and can help supplement moderate‐resolution global distributions and outdated regional maps.","",https://doi.org/10.1002/rse2.394,"",,
rayyan-220266279,The Benefit of Coralline Algae Science to Elevate Ocean Literacy,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Marine habitats will face a growing number of pressures in the coming decades because of anthropogenically induced climate change, ocean warming and ocean acidification, biodiversity shifts and overexploitation (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 2023). Effective engagement of scientific research beyond academia is crucial for maximising the resilience of nature to these global challenges (Herbert-Read et al. 2022). Ocean literacy is a fundamental first step towards global marine science education, research and effective conservation of ecologically important ecosystems (Santoro et al. 2017; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 2013). Here, we provide some examples (not an exhaustive list) of recent outreach initiatives across multiple media types that were designed to elevate public knowledge about coralline algae—globally distributed calcified red seaweeds—and their associated habitats, known as coralline algae reefs, maerl beds or rhodolith beds. Placed within the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission of UNESCO (IOC/UNESCO) Ocean Literacy Framework (Santoro et al. 2017) and aligned to the seven 'Essential Principles of Ocean Literacy' (Box 1), we show that coralline algae are an excellent basis for elevating ocean literacy at local, regional and global scales and transcending diverse public groups. An ocean-literate person understands the Essential Principles and Fundamental Concepts about the ocean; can communicate about the ocean in a meaningful way; and is able to make informed and responsible decisions regarding the ocean and its resources. Principle 1: Earth has one big ocean with many features. Principle 2: The ocean and life in the ocean shape the features of Earth. Principle 3: The ocean is a major influence on weather and climate. Principle 4: The ocean makes Earth habitable. Principle 5: The ocean supports a great diversity of life and ecosystems. Principle 6: The ocean and humans are inextricably interconnected. Principle 7: The ocean is largely unexplored. Coralline algae are present in all the ocean basins with global distribution. Public engagement centred around coralline algae therefore opens up the opportunity for bringing in global scale ocean literacy concepts. In 2022, Costa et al. published an accessible introduction to rhodoliths in the journal Frontiers for Young Minds (Figure 1a)—an alternative academic journal that includes children as peer reviewers and input from mentors and teachers. This paper provides an accessible introduction to rhodoliths, targeted towards younger audiences (but with relevance for all ages), engaging participation in the scientific process from a young age and inspiring the next generation of scientists. Key concepts and terminologies were introduced, such as the importance and implications of their global distribution, with local context of searching for 'redstones' or 'rhodoliths' at the beach, how coralline algae act as 'bioengineers', their role in 'blue carbon' and the importance of conserving these unique habitats for future prosperity. We suggest that through increasing the number of popular science articles about coralline algal research, it is possible to bolster the public understanding of the occurrence and global significance of coralline algal habitats. Encouraging widespread distribution of these articles via social media and other outlets will enable coordinated global scale reach. Marine science documentaries can inspire, educate and transform complex scientific concepts and serve to be informative tools in science communication (Staaterman et al. 2014). Biogenic maerl beaches are geologically significant, with rhodoliths found frequently in Cenozoic deposits and through the formation of recent sedimentological micro-habitats such as maerl subaqueous dunes (mega-ripples) as well as biogenic gravel beaches composed of fossilised maerl debris (Freiwald 1995; Joshi 2016). Therefore, they have proven to be a useful example to illustrate Principle 2—where biology and geology meet. The Trá an Doílín beach in county Galway, Ireland, is popularly known as the 'Coral Strand' in the local community and frequently mistaken to be composed of coral, not coralline algae. To elevate coralline algae ocean literacy and to preserve local knowledge previously unrecorded, Dr Siddhi Joshi led the direction and production of an hour-long documentary 'Maerl: A Rare Seabed Habitat'. In this, focusing on Ireland's maerl beds, the documentary covered a diverse range of multidisciplinary maerl research spanning botany, zoology, habitat mapping, conservation management, geology, hydrographic surveying and geophysics (Joshi and Documentary Team 2014; Figure 1b). Through a series of interviews with coralline algae/maerl experts, this documentary was able to show how stakeholders and coastal communities are affected by anthropogenic activities that target maerl bed, including commercial extraction, dredging, salmon farming and bottom trawling, now freely available on the 'Seabed Habitats' collaborative research blog (seabedhabitats.org). Through a film screening on Aran Island in county Galway, west of Ireland (at Inisheer Film Festival), the film helped raise local awareness of the presence and conservation significance of maerl, in light of a previous salmon farm proposal in a neighbouring local area. Attendees included local fishermen and conservation groups, tourists and marine scientists. Another locally significant maerl documentary is 'Pink Maerl and Salmon Farms– Scotland's Barrier Reef' (Little Green Island Films 2023), inspired by the rising citizen science movement to protect maerl beds in Scotland (Hall-Spencer and Rasmusson 2024; Figure 1c). Receiving more than 2000 views from around the world, these video documentaries have given regional coralline algal science a global public platform. Biogeochemistry can be easily left behind in public engagement by not being as charismatic or broadly understood as other topics like biodiversity (Sutton et al. 2013). However, their known importance as a globally important pool of dimethylated sulphur (Burdett, Hatton, and Kamenos 2015) has been showcased in public settings, including in a headline talk by Dr Heidi Burdett at the 2019 New Scientist Live—one of the largest science festivals in the world with more than 40,000 attendees, mostly of school age (Figure 1d). Dimethylated sulphur is important for weather and climate because of the role it may play in local-regional climate regulation through the stimulation of cloud formation (Hopkins et al. 2023). The longevity of coralline algae and the complexity of their calcium carbonate skeleton means they are excellent recorders of past climate, allowing us to reconstruct Holocene environmental change and identify the impacts of human activity. Research led by Dr Branwen Williams on Arctic coralline climate reconstruction has been featured by National Geographic, with a video on YouTube (link here) that has received 46,000 views from around the world (Figure 1e; Williams, personal communication). Marine photosynthesis supports almost all ocean life, and coralline algae have been recorded at deeper depths than any other alga in the ocean (Gattuso et al. 2006). The extraordinary ability for coralline algae to photosynthesise under a huge range of light environments has been a recent research focus (e.g., Krieger et al. 2023; Voerman et al. 2023; Voerman et al. 2022). However, photosynthesis—especially in the ocean—can be an abstract concept to understand. Since 2019, Dr Heidi Burdett in collaboration with Dekko Comics (dekkocomics.com) has used science comics as a medium to start conversations and increase knowledge about coralline algal photosynthesis. Drawing on the known benefits of science comics with visual design, narratives and metaphors (Farinella 2018), more than 6000 copies of this comic have been distributed around the world (as of May 2024) in schools, museums, music festivals, and more (Figure 1f). Known to increase engagement, learning motivation and improve understanding of STEM subjects, science comics are a valuable but underexplored genre in science communication. Scientific illustrations have also been suggested by rhodolith researchers in Costa Rica to help communicate the importance of rhodoliths to different age groups and to rangers of marine protected areas (MPAs), so they can identify rhodoliths in their conservation areas. The group is actively involved in talks to university students, courses for the nonscientific population about algae where this topic is included, as well as education for tourism companies so they can recognise the beds and the ecosystem services they provide (Fernández García, personal communication). Coralline algal habitats are one of the ocean's most biodiverse ecosystems (Tuya et al. 2023). They therefore present an opportunity to showcase Nature's biodiversity beyond the more commonly targeted ecosystems such as coral reefs or rainforests. Art–science collaboration, such as Julia Barton's maerl-themed 'Littoral Art Project' and performance exhibition (littoralartproject.com), is one novel example which utilised dance as an art-form to communicate the diversity of coralline algae ecosystems. Using personifications of a crab, sea cucumber and octopus to artistically explore the maerl habitat, the threats of anthropogenic activities such as dredging and the 'sanctuary' can be provided by MPAs. Marine citizen science is a growing method for improving ocean literacy and has now reached out to coralline algae. In Scotland, for example, citizen science initiatives via Seasearch (www.seasearch.org.uk) have helped to increase biodiversity records on maerl beds and improve conservation policy compliance (Hall-Spencer and Rasmusson 2024). Maerl is a celebrated commodity in some parts of the world. For example, the 'Fête du maerl' cultural festival takes place every 4 years in Brittany with more than 5000 attendees. Historically, maerl was used as a soil conditioner for treating acidic soils in the region; extraction of maerl from the seabed therefore had the dual benefit of supporting fertile agricultural land and a fishing industry (Figure 1g). Over time then, maerl has had an inextricable link to human socioeconomic and cultural values that continues to live on in conservation initiatives and museum exhibitions (e.g., Óceanopolis aquarium in Brest; www.oceanopolis.com/en). At a global scale, coralline algae have also been a leading feature of local initiatives around the world within the Global Seaweed-SUPERSTAR Project (https://globalseaweed.org/). For example, the project has capacity-building initiatives in Tanzania, Malaysia and the Philippines to improve seaweed (including coralline algae) taxonomic identification skills in the local community and to identify diseases. These efforts are communicated via policy briefs and guidance videos for publics and industry. Despite their ecological, biogeochemical, socioeconomic and cultural importance and global ubiquity, coralline algae and their associated habitats remain poorly studied (Tuya et al. 2023). Even now, our knowledge about their distribution remains patchy. Public engagement with coralline algae citizen science initiatives hold promise for scaling-up our exploration and distributional recording of coralline algae habitats (Hall-Spencer and Rasmusson 2024). This can be further facilitated by public networks such as the Irish Ocean Literacy Network (irishoceanliteracy.ie) and combined ocean mapping-outreach initiatives such as the 'Real Map of Ireland'—which showcases the tremendous progress we have made in recent years to map our ocean floors and identify new habitats such as maerl beds. Through participation in international conferences (COLACMAR, SOFILAC), data on rhodolith beds in Costa Rica have been translated into maps showing conservation gaps at the national level. This helps to additionally augment the research efforts studying fossil and recent rhodoliths from Central America (Caribbean and Pacific), with the aim of identifying the main species (from a morphological and genetic perspective), analysing their historical biogeography, describing their development environments and generating conservation recommendations (Fernández García, personal communication). Embracing emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence is crucial if coralline algae science is to keep pace with other disciplines. It is here where innovation in coralline algal public engagement can build on its foundation, looking forward to our next generation of coralline algal scientists, conservationists, policymakers and advocates. A first step towards this can be seen in the NASA NeMO-Net videogame (van den Bergh et al. 2021; nemonet.info; Figure 1h) where seabed classification (of, for example, coral reefs and coralline algae) feeds into a neural network to progress and improve habitat mapping. In this citizen science for the digital age, users are trained in seabed classification on virtual dives by a Remotely Operated Vehicle. Having reached more than 300 million people within 7 months of launch (van den Bergh et al. 2021), it is clear that digital engagement holds great potential for widespread engagement in both ocean and technology literacy. We hope to see more innovations in this space with particular emphasis on co-creating with educators' materials, resources and information. Most people only engage with the ocean through the visual of the flat ocean surface, suggesting calm and nothingness underneath (Williams, personal communication). Visualising the ocean as a three-dimensional or more dynamic four-dimensional changing environment is therefore of crucial importance and may be achieved using emerging technologies such as ocean digital twins—a current multimillion Euro priority for the European Commission (European Commission 2022). Activities that highlight how complex the ocean is and integral to our earth science is important. This is done particularly well through engaging storytelling, including high-quality visuals—several examples of which we have highlighted here. Language and illiteracy barriers should be overcome through translation of resources to local language(s) and a focus on non–text-based engagement materials. Coralline algae-specific resources are sparse compared to other habitats and species—here we demonstrate that redressing this balance can help us to advance local–global ocean literacy. Permissions are granted for the use of images in Figure 1, where necessary. The authors would like to thank Cindy Fernández García and Branwen Williams for their contributions to the global examples included for the ocean literacy principles and two anonymous reviewers for improving the quality of the final manuscript.

rayyan-220266370,Reconstruction of Wide Swath Significant Wave Height From Quasi‐Synchronous Observations of Multisource Satellite Sensors,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract Global sea wave monitoring is of utmost importance for tasks such as analysis of ocean climate change, offshore fisheries, and early warning of marine disasters. Significant wave height (SWH) is one of the most vital and widely used metrics for measuring sea waves in marine research. Hence, obtaining high precision and extensive coverage measurements of SWH is of great significance for comprehensive sea wave studies. A data set is constructed by combining wave spectrometer and scatterometer data from China‐French Ocean Satellite, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) wave mode data from Sentinel‐1, and altimeter data from Jason‐3 and HY‐2B through space‐time matching method. The multi‐sources integrated data set is used to complete the reconstruction of the wide swath SWH. A model based on stacked autoencoder and deep neural network (SAE‐DNN) is developed. The SWH reconstructed by the model is evaluated with the training‐independent test set. The results demonstrate that the accuracy of the SAE‐DNN model is significantly improved by incorporating SAR joint quasi‐synchronous observations and the root mean square error can reach 0.217 m, which is comparable to the SWH measured by altimeter and highlights the effectiveness and reliability of the model in accurately reconstructing SWH. We further examine and analysis the distance variations between SWH reconstruction sites and Surface Wave Investigation and Monitoring observations, the influence of different SAR features, and the influence of sea state, highlighting the benefits of incorporating SAR data into SAE‐DNN model.","",https://doi.org/10.1029/2023ea003162,"",,
rayyan-220266414,Discriminating Seagrasses from Green Macroalgae in European Intertidal Areas Using High-Resolution Multispectral Drone Imagery,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Coastal areas support seagrass meadows, which offer crucial ecosystem services, including erosion control and carbon sequestration. However, these areas are increasingly impacted by human activities, leading to habitat fragmentation and seagrass decline. In situ surveys, traditionally performed to monitor these ecosystems, face limitations on temporal and spatial coverage, particularly in intertidal zones, prompting the addition of satellite data within monitoring programs. Yet, satellite remote sensing can be limited by too coarse spatial and/or spectral resolutions, making it difficult to discriminate seagrass from other macrophytes in highly heterogeneous meadows. Drone (unmanned aerial vehicle—UAV) images at a very high spatial resolution offer a promising solution to address challenges related to spatial heterogeneity and the intrapixel mixture. This study focuses on using drone acquisitions with a ten spectral band sensor similar to that onboard Sentinel-2 for mapping intertidal macrophytes at low tide (i.e., during a period of emersion) and effectively discriminating between seagrass and green macroalgae. Nine drone flights were conducted at two different altitudes (12 m and 120 m) across heterogeneous intertidal European habitats in France and Portugal, providing multispectral reflectance observation at very high spatial resolution (8 mm and 80 mm, respectively). Taking advantage of their extremely high spatial resolution, the low altitude flights were used to train a Neural Network classifier to discriminate five taxonomic classes of intertidal vegetation: Magnoliopsida (Seagrass), Chlorophyceae (Green macroalgae), Phaeophyceae (Brown algae), Rhodophyceae (Red macroalgae), and benthic Bacillariophyceae (Benthic diatoms), and validated using concomitant field measurements. Classification of drone imagery resulted in an overall accuracy of 94% across all sites and images, covering a total area of 467,000 m2. The model exhibited an accuracy of 96.4% in identifying seagrass. In particular, seagrass and green algae can be discriminated. The very high spatial resolution of the drone data made it possible to assess the influence of spatial resolution on the classification outputs, showing a limited loss in seagrass detection up to about 10 m. Altogether, our findings suggest that the MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI) onboard Sentinel-2 offers a relevant trade-off between its spatial and spectral resolution, thus offering promising perspectives for satellite remote sensing of intertidal biodiversity over larger scales.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/rs16234383,"",,

EVELYN HUTCHINSON AWARD Elizabeth B. Kujawinski, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. EBK: Together with my lab group, we quantify small polar metabolites in seawater that may be used in exchange reactions between microbes. Although some of our measurements target molecules that have been observed by others (like amino acids), many of our measurements are the first of their kind in seawater and thus bring new insights into the molecules that could be important currencies in marine microbial consortia. My favorite molecule in this context is pantothenic acid (vitamin B5). Pantothenic acid is a precursor to coenzyme A (CoA), a critical intermediate in the carbon cycle, and its intracellular concentrations can regulate carbon cycling in many cells. Because almost all organisms can produce pantothenic acid due to its role in the foundational metabolism of the cell, vitamin B5 was not considered to be an important molecule for exchange among microbes and thus was rarely measured in seawater. Over the past four years, we measured monthly or bi-monthly pantothenic acid concentrations at the Bermuda Atlantic Time-series Study (BATS) site in the North Atlantic Ocean. The depth profile of pantothenic acid is remarkably stable over time, with elevated concentrations in the upper 100 m, and decreasing into the mesopelagic zone. With newer methods, we see some structure in these profiles, indicating that pantothenic acid concentrations are responding to different consortia with depth. I am interested in determining the controlling factors on pantothenic concentrations with the goal of understanding its role in consortia and its turnover time in the surface ocean. EBK: C-CoMP has a multifaceted mission: (1) to explore the intricacies of the microbe-metabolite network in the ocean sufficiently to understand its role in regulating carbon cycling and its sensitivities to a changing climate; (2) to expand ocean literacy at all education levels; and (3) to broaden the diversity of ocean scientists. In our science research, we use a combination of laboratory, field, and computational studies to explore ocean microbes and their chemical impact at high resolution and efficiency in the current and future environment. Our education researchers study how to bring more ocean science content to K–12 science curricula and how to support emerging research careers within undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral research populations. In addition, we develop and support course-based undergraduate research experiences (CUREs) that bring our ocean science research to undergraduate classrooms. Finally, C-CoMP supports two year fellowships for postbaccalaureate students and for postdoctoral scholars. We use open-science approaches and best practices in team science to build a culture of equity and inclusion in C-CoMP. If we are successful in our renewal proposal, ten years of C-CoMP will build a community of integrated scholars and educators dedicated to understanding important ocean processes at a critical time for our planet. I hope that this community will be ready to tackle important questions of carbon cycling, in particular, the rates of change with the microbe-metabolite network that impact carbon flux in the surface ocean. I hope that we will provide a pathway for K–12 curricula to incorporate ocean science literacy to educate the next generation about the importance of the ocean in our planet's health. Lastly, I hope that the next generation of ocean scientists will include talent from all backgrounds and lived experiences, ready to bring their creativity and ingenuity to mitigating the impacts of climate change on the ocean's ecosystems. EBK: I would like to understand the rates of turnover of metabolites within the labile DOM pool in different strata of the ocean. These rates are critically important to understanding the dynamics of labile DOM and, by extension, to the sensitivity of the carbon turnover every year in the surface ocean. Adding these rates (and related parameters) to biogeochemical models will rapidly expand our ability to probe the intricacies of the ocean microbiome. My lab has developed two new methods for measuring dissolved metabolites; these methods use sufficiently small sample volumes such that they are suitable for rate studies that disentangle the sources and sinks of metabolites. I would like to train the next generation of DOM scientists to use these methods to answer our community's emerging questions at the intersection of marine microbial ecology and biogeochemistry. I cannot imagine a better legacy than empowering marine scientists across the world to understand our oceans better. RAYMOND L. LINDEMAN AWARD Richard LaBrie, McGill University (current), Université de Montréal (former). RL: It is hard to think of a single surprising result as there were many. In studies where you have multiple different types of analysis covering a wide array of biological and chemical properties, especially when they are so widespread in time, most results come sequentially and not all at once. For example, I measured the first DOC (dissolved organic carbon) and FDOM (fluorescent dissolved organic matter) concentrations rapidly when I came back from the Labrador Sea, but I had to wait a few months to analyze Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry samples and several more months for 16S. By the time I got the 16S data, the core story about DOM transformation was shaping and this new analysis, which brought a different perspective than the chemical data, fit nicely with the patterns that we observed. I think this is what surprised me the most, every time I included a new analysis, it made sense with the existing story without modifying it too much. About two years after starting the experiment when I measured the last DOC samples, they all had the same values which was surprising to me, but still made sense. Of course, finding the right approach and analysis to use took time and efforts at every step of the process and I needed to be creative on how to illustrate the results to make a cohesive story. But overall, there were no conflicting results even with such a diverse array of analyses. RL: I think the microbial carbon pump (MCP) has a lot of research opportunities as there are so many unknowns. When we read the literature on the subject, the MCP is depicted as an important pathway of carbon sequestration that has, over a long period of time, built up the immense reservoir of DOC in the oceans. However, we also need to remember that carbon sequestrated this way by microbes is the exception, not the norm: most of the organic molecules are incorporated into biomass or mineralized. Finding under which specific circumstances refractory dissolved organic carbon (RDOC) is produced will allow us to calculate the rates of sequestration and assess the potential magnitude of this process in response to climate change. This field of research is also heavily method-driven, and I think we (the scientific community) will need to take a step back to get a broader picture before moving forward. On a final thought, my study looked at the question using multiple angles taken from biogeochemistry, microbial ecology, and ocean physics. I believe that future breakthroughs will also require collaboration among different fields of research to have a more holistic understanding of the MCP. RL: Publishing is a hard process and there is no shortcut. First, you need to hone your writing skills, especially if English is not your first language. The way you transmit your ideas in an article is as important as the ideas themselves: there are thousands of papers published in aquatic sciences each year and you need your research to stand out. There are numerous excellent books on how to write, how to write science, on writing habits, and so on. Find one that you enjoy reading and re-reading, this will make your own writing much easier. Learn to enjoy writing, it will become less of a burden but something you are excited about. All the efforts that you put in learning how to be a better writer will pay off multiple times over your career, whether you stay in academia or not. Once the paper is written and all co-authors are happy with it, there is still the peer-review process. And it is hard. More often than not, reviewers will tear down the article and find everything that does not work, hopefully to make your science and/or storytelling better. When you first open the comments and read through them, you will likely get irritated, or sad, or any negative emotion really. That is normal. Take a deep breath, finish reading and close your document for at least twenty-four to forty-eight hours; there is nothing good that will come out of this in this state of mind. When that primal response is gone, open it again and start editing your manuscript. My experience is that I tend to agree with reviewers when they say something is not clear. If you learn to appreciate writing, editing your manuscript to incorporate reviewers' comments will be a lot easier. And then repeat for the number of reviewing rounds that is needed. My MCP paper got two desk rejections, and three split decisions before being accepted. Do not get discouraged with a negative review and use this opportunity to make your work better. ALFRED C. REDFIELD LIFETIME ACHIEVEMENT AWARD John Smol, Queen's University. JS: If I look back at my career and try to identify my biggest achievement, the answer is simple: it is the over 100 graduates (and an even larger number of undergraduates) that have passed through our lab and gone on to develop remarkable careers mainly in academia, but also in key government, NGO, or consultancy positions. When getting an award, I sometimes feel (to use a Canadian analogy) like the coach of an NHL hockey team that wins the Stanley Cup, but only I come onto the ice to hold the trophy! The contributions of my students and other collaborators have been remarkable. If I deserve any award, it should be for attracting highly dedicated and hard-working people, who enjoy doing important science and are a pleasure to be with. When it comes to career turning points, and again this was very much a team effort, it was when I was still in my 20s, and acid rain was the major environmental issue in many parts of the world. Until then, paleolimnology was very much seen as an esoteric field, accused by some to be little more than ""story telling."" Critical questions in the 1980s were: Have lakes acidified? If so, when and by how much? And who was to blame? A highly polarized debate was underway. Several of us realized that these questions could be answered from the sedimentary record if we could develop ways to reconstruct pH and associated changes over decades and centuries. This was a hectic time when policymakers wanted results and wanted them fast, and so highly reliable methods had to be quickly developed and applied. It helped that this issue also attracted diverse scientists, perhaps most notably those with highly developed numerical skills who would work with us to develop transfer functions and other multi-proxy approaches. Paleolimnologists showed that our techniques were robust and reproducible and that we could answer key policy questions. This time was also a turning point for me as I began working frequently with the media, being interviewed on TV, radio, and newspapers (we did not have online media yet!) about our research and what it meant. I quickly realized that if there was an information vacuum, it would quickly be filled by opinions from vested interest groups. Scientists had to counter wishful thinking with evidence. It was a ""baptism of fire"" for me at this time. Things were different then in universities, and you often needed a thick skin—well of course there were serious attacks from the acid-producing industries (and their proxies), but also to some extent from other academics. I would hear, often second hand, comments like ""Smol never saw a microphone he didn't like."" My view then is the same as it is now—the public, by-and-large, pay for the research we do, and they have a right to know what we found. If we do not transfer that knowledge and fill the information void with accessible language, then it will be filled by others. JS: This project (Smol 2023) started with winning the International Ecology Institute Prize (https://www.int-res.com/ecology-institute/eci-prize), and one aspect of the award was to write a book (on any topic) in their Excellence in Ecology series (https://www.int-res.com/book-series/excellence-in-ecology-books/ee30/). I was always interested in the Arctic as one of the last largely unexplored areas on the planet, and last year marked my fortieth anniversary of Arctic research. Given the paucity of direct limnological observations, and given the sensitivity of polar regions, it was an ideal region to apply paleolimnological approaches. In this thirteen chapter book, which is part memoir and part textbook, I recounted the many ways we used history to address key environmental issues. An overriding theme is the critical role that accelerated climate change plays as a ""threat multiplier."" Highlighted research includes collaborations with Indigenous knowledge holders and archeologists, tracking past ocean flooding events, the repercussions of permafrost thaw, the effects of pollutants from both local and distant sources, as well as tracking long-term changes in salmon and seabird populations. I emphasize the importance of using diverse sources of information, the role that personal relationships can play in successful collaborative programs (i.e., work well with colleagues and they will work well with you), and issues linked to environmental justice for Northern peoples. JS: I was asked to be the founding editor of the Journal of Paleolimnology when I was ~ thirty years old, a position I held for twenty years, and then became Editor of Environmental Reviews. Over those thirty-five plus years I learned that reviews are at times ""opinions"" and are not necessarily ""facts,"" and that editors, as gatekeepers, must be thorough and vigilant in weighing the evidence. You do not become an editor hoping to win popularity contests. Authors, reviewers, and editors are human, and often have strong opinions on what is right. The peer-review process, with all its frustrations, is not perfect, but it is the best system available. I have often found that ECRs make excellent referees—they often know the recent literature well and have a keen interest in moving science forward. Yes, we are all busy, and yes, it is easy to press ""decline,"" but it is our collective responsibility to contribute to the peer-review process. Mentors can play a key role here as well. If senior scientists cannot do a review, they can suggest ECRs (whom the editor may not yet know) as alternate referees. ECRs can also take a proactive approach and send their CVs to editors, noting they are available to review in specific areas. If you are asked to do a review, accept the role (if appropriate) and appreciate that your main job is to point out errors in approaches or conclusions, with an overall goal of improving the paper. Remember, there are constructive ways to criticize. Stated more plainly, being anonymous is no excuse for being a jerk! RUTH PATRICK AWARD Bernard Sweeney, Stroud Water Research Center. Photo credit: Wandering Beagle Photography-CC BY-NC-SA 4.0. BS: Early in graduate school at the University of Pennsylvania, Dr. Ruth Patrick handed me a small collection of recently published articles. They described how unnatural thermal modification of river reaches downstream of large dams (cold water) and power plants (hot water) was extinguishing the resident aquatic fauna and flora, although lethal minimum or maximum temperatures did not appear to be involved. Ruth said ""read the papers and think about this huge environmental problem"" and ""a reasonable hypothesis for this matter will be a meaningful contribution to limnology."" At the time, Ruth was my thesis advisor so I took this challenge very seriously. I discussed several ideas with Dr. Robin Vannote who was also on my advisory committee and Director of the Stroud Water Research Center at the time. He thought my initial ideas were ""too obvious"" and ""unlikely to be productive"" and so challenged me to think more broadly and deeply about the problem. My thinking and emphasis at the time was on aquatic insects, especially mayflies (order Ephemeroptera) because they were being devastated by the thermal pollution. In addition, mayflies were well suited for laboratory work because some species had short life cycles, all were short lived as adults, and females metamorphosed with their full complement of eggs (hence fecundity reflects larval rearing conditions). So, I proposed field and laboratory studies involving the interaction of temperature with larval bioenergetics, developmental dynamics, and the ecological/biogeographical aspects of life history phenomena. After a series of experiments under different temperature regimes (fluctuating and constant; published in L&O and Ecology) and considering the geographic distribution of mayfly species, we (Vannote and me) published the ""Thermal Equilibrium Hypothesis"" in Science (Sweeney and Vannote 1978) and The American Naturalist (Vannote and Sweeney 1980). The hypothesis proposed, among other things, that extreme temperature patterns caused by humans or by extreme southern or northern locations disrupted a species' metabolic, growth, and developmental dynamics, and hence life history characteristics such that individual fecundity was compromised leading to gradual population extinction. This success inspired me to consider other questions/challenges related to aquatic insects and stream and river ecosystems and seek fundamental solutions with good science. I believe that our field can and should continue to evolve in this direction i.e., seeking answers and direction grounded in the best science and using it as the basis for sound environmental policy. BS: My best advice is to be eclectic i.e., generate your ideas and approaches to understanding, evaluating, and solving scientific/environmental problems from a broad and diverse range of sources. In looking back, I benefitted from reading a broad spectrum of articles in aquatic journals associated with societies like ASLO, Society for Freshwater Science, the Ecological Society of America, the Society for Evolution. However, with the encouragement of Robin Vannote in graduate school, I also developed a lifelong habit of browsing through all the articles in the weekly issues of the journal Science while always looking at each abstract, article, or news item for something of value or relevance to aquatic science. This was mentally stimulating and rewarding in terms of research approaches and ideas and encouraged me to incorporate the latest technology into my experimentation. Also, I think it helped me pose questions regarding aquatic ecosystems that were forward thinking and often out of the norm. BS: It is hard for me to separate lessons learned in graduate school from Drs. Ruth Patrick and Robin Vannote. Both always emphasized the need to understand how a stream or river worked naturally in order to: (1) know whether it was disturbed or impacted by something; (2) the degree to which it was impacted; and (3) how to mitigate the impact. In other words, basic research on natural systems was key to evaluating and restoring disturbed/polluted systems. Robin was more interested in natural ecosystems. Ruth always stressed that you could learn a lot from carefully studying both pristine and polluted aquatic ecosystems. Ruth kept you on your toes. There was no passing by her without her asking you questions like…. What new thing did you learn today? What exciting paper did you read in the last two days and please give me a three-sentence summary? If she assigned five technical papers to read before the next class, you had better have read and thought about them because she was going to call on someone (maybe you) to stand up and provide a summary and take away message for all five. In her lectures, Ruth emphasized the resiliency of aquatic ecosystems, with each species being quite resilient unto itself and collectively contributing to the resiliency of the ecosystem. She cautioned, however, that the magnitude and frequency of human impacts can overwhelm this resiliency. She often used field trips to drive home her lecture points. For example, one Sunday morning she had us (graduate students) collect from a stream in Pennsylvania that was impacted by acid mine pollution and then we spent the afternoon collecting from a natural stream in the New Jersey pine barrens. The pH of both streams was highly acidic (~ 3). We collected very few individuals or species of algae, macroinvertebrates, and fish from the acid mine stream but many individuals and species from the pine barren stream. Ruth collected alongside of us in her hip boots despite being around sixty-five years old but spoke little all day. At days end, we reported out our findings. Without discussion she then said: ""Ladies and Gentlemen, you now have demonstrated for yourselves that aquatic species and ecosystems can adapt to stressful situations (like low pH) but if, only if, they are given enough time… class dismissed."" Other take aways for me from Ruth and Robin were: (1) aquatic systems are resilient and so polluted ones will recover with restoration of a more natural setting; (2) diversity within and among trophic levels is the key to ecosystem stability and functionality; (3) each species is important; (4) science is fast paced and one needs to work 24/7 at it to excel; (5) set the bar high and then go for it; and (6) do not give up… just think about it harder.

PH: Work around the idea of lake metabolism has changed substantially in the past twenty years. Initially, the community focused on deployment of the kinds of sensors needed to estimate metabolism, especially dissolved oxygen and temperature, as well as meteorological data in some cases. Because of the costs and the effort, people mostly measured these variables at one location near the lake surface and during typical field seasons (summer). Questions around spatial heterogeneity arose, and a bunch of work emerged on littoral vs. pelagic metabolism and metabolism at different depths in the water column. In lakes with substantial littoral zones, spatial heterogeneity can matter a lot. In stratified lakes, there are big differences between epilimnetic and hypolimnetic metabolism. Similarly for time, there were important questions about seasonal to annual scales of metabolism that people began addressing as sensor deployments began spanning years. It came as no surprise that in lakes with strong seasonal patterns, lake metabolism varied with seasonal temperature, stratification patterns, and available light and nutrients. Analytical models evolved at the same time to include variations on process-based models, both in their complicatedness and how they were fit to the observational data. With multi-year data and models that accommodated seasonality, people began asking questions about whole lake carbon budgets and the roles lakes play in the landscape-scale carbon cycling. Recently, there has been an emphasis on lake metabolism as a framework for water quality, because the modeling approach lends itself to estimating dynamics of oxygen, particulate organic carbon (index of algal biomass), and water clarity. These three variables are indicators of lake trophic state and can determine, for example, oxythermal habitat. PH: To me, the most rewarding aspect of this highly cited paper is the discussions and collaborations it has catalyzed. As a reader, some of my favorite papers are relatively simple, with a clear question and results that speak clearly to the question. I feel like our paper meets those criteria. Our paper also came out about the time when sensors were becoming affordable for limnologists. I do not think we anticipated how a simple science question, coupled with new and accessible technologies, would resonate so well with our community. PH: The Global Lake Ecological Observatory Network (GLEON) started as a collaboration between two limnologists, David Hamilton and Tim Kratz, and two computer scientists, Peter Arzberger and Fang-Pang Lin. The initial vision was to build a global network of lake observatories that would provide data across new time scales over a broad gradient of lake ecosystems. Lake metabolism was an early use-case. As GLEON rapidly grew, lake metabolism became the topic of one of the working groups, because it is easy to understand, is relevant to many questions about lakes and reservoirs, makes great use of commonly measured limnological variables, and can be modeled in different ways towards different problems. Lake metabolism also helped catalyze common software code development. There are a number of software tools from GLEON that are still in use today, including LakeMetabolizer. Sharing ideas, skills, and resources is baked into the GLEON collaborative framework, and lake metabolism is an idea and approach that fits nicely therein. For NTL-LTER, there is more to say than I have space to say it, but the theme is that NTL-LTER enables innovative research of all kinds, including lake metabolism. Many lake metabolism papers are about the NTL-LTER study lakes or include them in more extensive analyses because of the comprehensive and long-term data, which are openly available. However, it always comes back to the community. Colleagues at NTL-LTER are a constant source of ideas, productivity, and support, which has led to many creative papers on metabolism. Most recent work has included long-term phenology of lake metabolism, projections of recovery from eutrophication based on a metabolism framework, and use of lake metabolism to train machine learning models. RAMÓN MARGALEF AWARD FOR EXCELLENCE IN EDUCATION Robert ""Bob"" Chen, University of Massachusetts Boston. RC: I come from a family of educators. I joined the Environmental Sciences Program at University of Massachusetts Boston in 1992. This was a graduate program, but I told the dean that I wanted to teach undergraduate students. Thirty-two years later, I teach the largest class on campus, Introduction to Environmental Science, at five hundred and fifty students, and the program has become a fully independent undergraduate and graduate School for the Environment. My first exploration of outreach was a large ocean education fair where I showed how lasers could be used to detect chlorophyll and colored dissolved organic matter in seawater. It was a big hit, and I realized outreach was something at which I could be good, and that could make an impact on public understanding of ocean science. My first big project was the Watershed Integrated Sciences Partnership (WISP), where we worked with three school districts to integrate resources and activities around the Neponset Watershed in the classroom (https://www.wisp.umb.edu). WISP was supported by the NSF GK-12 program, where graduate science students were placed in middle school classrooms throughout the year. Through this project, I worked closely with Boston Public Schools, middle school teachers, and inquiry-based science curriculum, and developed professional development for scientists interested in teaching, science communication, and outreach. Then there was Centers for Ocean Science Education Excellence (COSEE): COSEE New England and COSEE OCEAN. Through this work and my service on the ASLO Education and Engagement Committee, I was able to collaborate regionally and nationally with ocean education experts, international organizations, and dedicated individuals from the science and informal and formal education communities. We developed the Ocean Literacy Principles, integrated ocean curriculum into national and local standards, created new positions in research organizations for education and outreach coordinators, and distributed over 20,000 copies of the Best of COSEE Hands-On Activities (http://www.cosee.net/best_activities). Two organizations have resulted from this work: COSEE China and the New England Ocean Science Collaborative (www.neosec.org).

rayyan-220267982,A neural-based bio-regionalization of the Mediterranean Sea using satellite and Argo-float records,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The regionalization of the Mediterranean Sea has been the subject of many studies. It is a miniature ocean where most of the processes of the global ocean are encountered (Lejeusne et al., 2010). Several features of the Mediterranean (near-tropical ocean in summer with a well-formed thermocline, near-polar ocean in winter with deep convection, multiple basins with different characteristics) make it a hotspot of marine biodiversity (Coll and al., 2010) and consequently vulnerable to climate change. It is therefore important to characterize the present state of the Mediterranean Sea with robust estimators in order to study the long-term evolution of this mesocosm.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We present a partitioning of the Mediterranean Sea in regions having well defined characteristics with respect to Sea Surface Temperature and surface chlorophyll observed by satellite, and Argo mixed layer depth. This regionalization was performed by using an innovative classification based on neural networks, the so-called 2S-SOM. Its major advantage is to consider the specificity of the variables by adding automatically, through machine learning, specific weights to each of them, which facilitates the classification and consequently highlights the regional correlations. The 2S-SOM provided a well differentiated regionalization of the Mediterranean Sea waters into seven bioregions governed by specific physical and biogeochemical processes such as Intermediate-water formation in the Aegean Sea, large surface currents in the Adriatic and the Alboran, deep winter convection phenomena in the Balearic and stratification phenomena during summer in the eastern part of the Mediterranean Sea.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Besides, in order to highlight the phytoplankton diversity in these regions, we processed the satellite ocean color observations with a specific neural network approach (SOM-PFT, El Hourany et al., 2019). As a result, specific phytoplankton communities characterized by their seasonal variability are associated with the obtained Mediterranean bioregions; the dominance of the Nanophytoplankton groups is largely observed in the western basin during the period ranging from autumn to spring. While the dominance of different types of cyanobacteria Synechococcus and Prochlorococcus is highlighted in summer and more precisely in the waters of the eastern basin. Diatoms dominate throughout the year in the coastal and shallow regions, which can be explained by the presence of terrigenous input necessary for the development of this type of phytoplankton. Diatoms also largely benefit from the strong deep convection in the Balearic Sea marked by a large bloom at the end of winter convection in March.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This work will be further extended to study the phytoplankton diversity at global scale using various data set from the Tara Oceans.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu2020-12004,"",,
rayyan-220268114,Detecting and Identifying Floating Plastic Debris in Coastal Waters using Sentinel-2 Earth Observation Data,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Satellite remote sensing is an invaluable tool for observing our earth systems. However, few studies have succeeded in applying this for detection of floating litter in the marine environment. We demonstrate that plastic debris aggregated on the ocean surface is detectable in optical data acquired by the European Space Agency (ESA) Sentinel-2 satellites. Furthermore, using an automated classification approach, we show that floating macroplastics are distinguishable from seawater, seaweed, sea foam, pumice, and driftwood.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Sentinel-2 was used to detect floating aggregations likely to include macroplastics across four study sites, namely: coastal waters of Accra (Ghana), Da Nang (Vietnam), the east coast of Scotland (UK), and the San Juan Islands (BC, Canada). Aggregations were detectable on sub-pixel scales using a Floating Debris Index (FDI), and were composed of a mix of materials including sea foam and seaweed. A probabilistic machine learning approach was then applied to assess if detected plastics could be discriminated from the natural sources of marine debris. Our automated Na&amp;amp;#239;ve Bayes classifier was trained using a library of pumice, seaweed, timber, sea foam and seawater detections, as well as validated macroplastics from Durban Harbour (South Africa). Across the four study sites, suspected marine plastics were classified as such with an accuracy approaching 90%. The &amp;amp;#8216;misclassified&amp;amp;#8217; plastics were mostly identified as seawater, suggesting an insufficient amount of pixel was filled with materials.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Results from this study show that plastic debris aggregated on the ocean surface can be detected in optical data collected by Sentinel-2, and identified. With the aim of generating global &amp;amp;#8216;hotspot&amp;amp;#8217; maps of floating plastics in coastal waters, automating this two-stage process across the Sentinel-2 archive is being progressed; however, the method would also be applicable to drones and other remote sensing platforms with similar band characteristics. To extend remote detection methods to river systems and optically complex and/or tidal coastal waters, in situ data collection across optical water types is the next key step.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu2020-19145,"",,
rayyan-220268308,Deforestation Prediction using Ensemble of Convolutional Neural Network Models,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Deforestation is the destruction of forest due to for a non-forest purpose [1]. The disadvantages due to deforestation are an increased amount of carbon dioxide emissions and soil erosion. Increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere increases temperature of the earth, leading to climate change. Also the destruction of forest habitat and the loss of biological diversity of both plants and animals occurs. With increased deforestation earth will lose its top fertile soil layer and get converted into desert. The ecological balance will get disturbed and floods and drought will become more frequent. Wildlife will also be affected. As of now there only one habitable planet, and we need to conserve all life and environment. The surface area of earth is around 510.1 million km2. In this about 29.2% is earths land area. And in that land area only around 30% is the Forest area [2]. There are several studies taken to monitor the deforestation happening in all over the world as well as India. One of the notable ones is which gives the data of loss of 28% forest covers over eight decades. The major deforestation has occurred due to conversion of forests to agricultural lands, timber product, construction of major projects such as reservoirs in dams, road construction etc. Several global, legally binding instruments (LBIs) have instituted requirements for national-level inventory and reporting (UNFF 2004c:7). The recently effective Kyoto Protocol requires the inventorying of land use-related deforestation, afforestation, and reforestation in developed country Parties. For afforestation to occur, it requires more active coordination to support, the environmental objectives of global conventions, such as the conservations on biodiversity and wetland protection [3].
There are many management challenges associated with global forest health. Conversion of forest land to commercial usage, constructions, etc. will not only decrease the forest health but also leads to extinction of many biodiversity’s. In terms of accounting systems for forest yields, global accounts of forest production are based on national reports and contain substantial gaps, particularly in respect to non-timber resources. So, there is no accurate measurement or number to count the number of trees lost. First step in addressing forest deforestation is to monitor and report changes in forest cover in areas that are reserved for forest in the country [4]. Manual labour checking of the land area is time consuming and never ending. In order to overcome this challenge high resolution satellite imaging are utilized. Once again, the manual labour is recurring and tiresome [5].  Use of machine learning methods has emerged in recent days to predict accurately how much of the land has undergone deforestation over the years. utilizing mathematical models and training the systems will result in automatic detection and less human labour for detecting the large amount of satellite data [6]. 
Tarazona, Yonatan, et al focuses on mapping tropical deforestation using time series and machine learning algorithms and were able to classify forest, cropland, bare soil, and water with more than 90% accuracy [7].  Large areas under deforestation and degradation threat, and location of suitable areas for regeneration were predicted by Grinand, Clovis, et al. through machine learning algorithms combined with high-resolution data sets to provide simultaneous and spatial forecasts of deforestation, land degradation, and regeneration for the next two decades [8]. Bavaghar et al. utilised logistic regression on satellite imagery data to estimate the location and extent of deforestation which achieved 75% accuracy [9]. Hyandye et al. used multinomial logistic regression to determine how land use/land cover class in Tanzania was influenced by a set of variables. The authors used the multinomial model, run on Landsat of data across multiple years, to obtain the probable change in land use/land cover.[10]. Szuste et al. [11] used Support Vector Machines for land use and land cover classification in tropical coastal zones achieved decent results.
Kavzoglu and Mather [12] used artificial neural networks to identify land use/land cover for remote sensing data in England, and provide a set of guidelines for practitioners for designing and using artificial neural networks in remote sensing image classification. Some examples of classification using neural networks for remote sensing data are provided by Srivastava et al. [14], Shao and Lunetta [13], and Wang et al. [15]. Kong et al.  [16] apply a long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network to predict forest fire based on a time series of Modis satellite images. They have used a composite time series instead of a single-pixel time series and examined changes to detect fire events. Convolutional neural networks have been successfully applied on multimedia approaches and used to create a system able to handle the classification without any human’s interactions. In [17], for satellite image classification that are based on deep learning convolutional neural network for features extraction used AlexNet, VGG19, GoogLeNet and Resnet50 pretraining models.  Akshay, S., et al, proposed a system for satellite image processing that detects unused land. Here remote sensing earth images are taken as the dataset where the pre-processing step includes converting image into greyscale image, compression and noise removal. Segmentation is done to partition the region of used and unused lands. Random forest is used to segregate two landscapes as used and unused land which gives accuracy better than the existing systems [18]. In the work for recognition in high-resolution, multi-spectral satellite imagery, Pritt, Mark, and Gary Chern [19] have described a deep learning system for classifying objects and facilities from the IARPA Functional Map of the World (fMoW) dataset into 63 different classes. The system consists of an ensemble of convolutional neural networks and additional neural networks that integrate satellite metadata with image features.
The proposed work addresses the detection of the forest cover areas as an important and holistic studies related to ongoing forest cover changes. The outline of the proposed work is shown in Fig.1 It consists of following steps. Preparing Input images acquired from the datasets. In this step the image is acquired, Pre-processed and augmented. Defined two classes for prediction, i.e. 0 is for “No Deforestation happened” and 1 is for “Deforestation”. Labelled the images accordingly and passed it to the pre-trained models for training the models. Pre-trained weights help to overcome the overfitting of the model with a smaller number of datasets. Feature extraction and classification using AlexNet, ResNet18 and DenseNet121 was done individually and all the results were ensembled. We have used Sentinel-2 datasets that is publicly available in Kaggle. 500 original images were used and four different data augmentation techniques were applied to generate more images. A total of 2500 images were utilized to train the models. Data was split into 80% training datasets and 20% validation datasets. 200 separate test sets were taken to verify the test accuracies.
In this proposed approach, all models used Adam optimizer with decreasing learning rate after every 10 epochs. All the graphs were plotted in TensorBoard. The training accuracies are shown in Fig2(a) and losses are shown in Fig 2(b).
After analysing the obtaining of the predictions of all three models, we combined the results of 3 models: AlexNet, ResNet18 and DenseNet121, and predicted the class which was most frequently predicted by all the models. This combined by the proposed Grid searched weighted average ensemble model gave the remarkable best performance and achieved a test accuracy of 90.12% and sensitivity of 95.06%.

rayyan-220270298,A deep learning approach for mapping and monitoring glacial lakes from space,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Climate change intensifies glacier melt which effectively leads to the formation of numerous new glacial lakes in the overdeepenings of former glacier beds. Additionally, the area of many existing glacial lakes is increasing. More than one thousand glacial lakes have emerged in Switzerland since the Little Ice Age, and hundreds of lakes are expected to form in the 21st century. Rapid deglaciation and formation of new lakes severely affect downstream ecosystem services, hydropower production and high-alpine hazard situations. Day by day, glacier lake inventories for high-alpine terrains are increasingly becoming available to the research community. However, a high-frequency mapping and monitoring of these lakes are necessary to assess hazards and to estimate Glacial Lake Outburst Flood (GLOF) risks, especially for lakes with high seasonal variations. One way to achieve this goal is to leverage the possibilities of satellite-based remote sensing, using optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellite sensors and deep learning.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There are several challenges to be tackled. Mapping glacial lakes using satellite sensors is difficult, due to the very small area of a great majority of these lakes. The inability of the optical sensors (e.g. Sentinel-2) to sense through clouds creates another bottleneck. Further challenges include cast and cloud shadows, and increased levels of lake and atmospheric turbidity. Radar sensors (e.g. Sentinel-1 SAR) are unaffected by cloud obstruction. However, handling cast shadows and natural backscattering variations from water surfaces are hurdles in SAR-based monitoring. Due to these sensor-specific limitations, optical sensors provide generally less ambiguous but temporally irregular information, while SAR data provides lower classification accuracy but without cloud gaps.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We propose a deep learning-based SAR-optical satellite data fusion pipeline that merges the complementary information from both sensors. We put forward to use Sentinel-1 SAR and Sentinel-2 L2A imagery as input to a deep network with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) backbone. The proposed pipeline performs a fusion of information from the two input branches that feed heterogeneous satellite data. A shared block learns embeddings (feature representation) invariant to the input satellite type, which are then fused to guide the identification of glacial lakes. Our ultimate aim is to produce geolocated maps of the target regions where the proposed bottom-up, data-driven methodology will classify each pixel either as &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;lake&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; or &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;background&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;. &amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;This work is part of two major projects: ESA AlpGlacier project that targets mapping and monitoring of the glacial lakes in the Swiss (and European) Alps, and the UNESCO (Adaptation Fund) GLOFCA project that aims to reduce the vulnerabilities of populations in the Central Asian countries (Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, and Kyrgyzstan) from GLOFs in a changing climate. As part of the GLOFCA project, we are developing a python-based analytical toolbox for the local authorities, which incorporates the proposed deep learning-based pipeline for mapping and monitoring the glacial lakes in the target regions in Central Asia.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu22-10637,"",,
