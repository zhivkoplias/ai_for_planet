rayyan-210772329,Monitoring and Simulation of Dynamic Spatiotemporal Land Use/Cover Changes,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Changes in land use/cover are among the most prominent impacts that humans have on the environment. Therefore, exploring land use/cover change is of great significance to urban planning and sustainable development. In this study, we preprocessed multiperiod land use and socioeconomic data, combined with spatial zoning, multilayer perception (MLP) artificial neural network, and Markov chain (MC), to construct a cellular automaton model of spatial zoning. Moreover, with the help of ArcGIS 10.2 and TerrSet 18.07 software, we explore the current status of land use and predict future changes. The results showed that drastic changes have occurred among different land use classes in Jinzhou District over the past 13 years owing to the impact of economic development and reclamation projects. Construction land, arable land, and waters have changed by +85.09, −24.42, and −23.62 km 2 , respectively. By comparing the FoM and Kappa coefficients, we concluded that the prediction accuracy of partitioned MLP-MC is better than that of unpartitioned MLP-MC. Therefore, using the spatial zoning approach to identify the conversion rules among land use classes in different zones can more effectively predict future land use changes and provide a reference for urban planning and policy making.","",https://doi.org/10.1155/2020/3547323,"",,
rayyan-210772400,Long-term satellite-based estimates of air quality and premature mortality in Equatorial Asia through deep neural networks,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Atmospheric pollution of particulate matter (PM) is a major concern for its deleterious effects on human health and climate. Over the past 50 years, Equatorial Asia has experienced significant land-use change and urbanization, which have contributed to more intense and frequent extreme PM concentrations associated with increased anthropogenic and wildfire emissions. Recent advances in remote sensing instrumentation and retrieval protocols have enabled effective monitoring of PM from space in near real time with almost global coverage. In this study, long-term satellite-based observations of key chemical and physical parameters, integrated with ground-based concentrations of PM with aerodynamic diameter <10 μm (PM10) measured at 52 stations, are used to develop a machine learning approach for continuous PM10 monitoring. As PM atmospheric pollution, like most of environmental processes, is highly non-linear and influenced by numerous variables, machine learning approaches seem very suitable. Herein, deep neural networks are developed and tested over different temporal scales and used to map PM10 over Equatorial Asia during the period 2005–2015. The proposed model captures both PM10 seasonal variability and the occurrence of extreme episodes, which are found to impact air quality on the regional scale. The modeled annual mean fine PM (PM2.5) concentrations are used to estimate long-term premature mortality. This study indicates that the region is experiencing increasing mortality rates related to long-term exposure to PM2.5, with 150 000 (108 000–193 000) premature deaths in 2005 and 204 000 (145 000–260 000) in 2015. This is mostly due to air quality worsening and high population growth in urban areas, although the contribution of years of intense wildfires results as well significant.","",https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/abb733,"",,
rayyan-210772417,LAND-USE PREDICTION IN PANDAAN DISTRICT PASURUAN REGENCY,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Land-use change in Pandaan District was identified as the fourth-highest in East Java Province. This change is due to the population increase caused by the strategic location of the Pandaan Sub-district, which is passed by the Surabaya-Malang City connecting road, creating a rapid development of built-up land. The spread of built-up land development with low density becomes the initial identification of the sprawl phenomenon. Changes in land-use due to push factors caused inconsistencies in the development of existing land as stipulated in spatial planning documents. This study aims to determine land-use change and land-use prediction in Pandaan Sub-district to be used for future planning. Research methods incorporated spatial analysis of land-use change and the land-use planning process in ArcMap and SELVA IDRISI. The land use forecasts for modeling are based on the use of the Cellular Automata (CA) -Markov method and the ANN / MLP method. Land-use changes were identified through land-use comparisons in recent years. The land-use prediction was determined through the land-use change transition by including the motivating and inhibiting variables of land-use changes. The results of the study stated that the most significant land-use change occurred in rural/urban villages passed by arterial and collector road connecting Surabaya-Malang City. CAMarkov results showed that the results of land-use prediction have a linear development pattern in the spreading road networks and residential settlements. The prediction results show that settlement increase13,62% and industry increase 20,7%..","",https://doi.org/10.21660/2020.65.41738,"",,
rayyan-210772491,Applying Observed Rainfall and Deep Neural Network for Urban Flood Analysis,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Urban flooding primarily occurs due to flash floods in low-lying regions or insufficient capacity of drainage systems. Urban inundation has become more dangerous to residents because of an increase in impermeable areas, uncertainties in urban sewage planning, and the accumulation of sedimentation in drainage pipes. As an urban watershed with a drainage system and an urbanized river is complicated, a specific time interval is required for the preparation and processing of urban runoff analysis. To allow for rapid simulations of urban runoff estimation during heavy rainfall, a deep neural network model that imitates the conditions of a 6-h duration rainfall was developed in this study. Ten different statistical aspects for each rainfall event were considered as input data, and the total accumulated overflow from a manhole was calculated at intervals of 10 min using storm water management model (SWMM). To verify the accuracy of the results from SWMM, the results obtained from a two-dimensional hydraulic model and an inundation trace map were compared. The computational times for the deep neural network and rainfall data-based models proposed in this study were estimated to be within 1 s, whereas the simulation using SWMM required 14 min. The proposed deep learning model was tested using the total accumulated overflow for the rainfall event observed at Gangnam (400) automatic weather station on July 27, 2011. The simulated results agreed with the observed results in terms of the total accumulated discharge.","",https://doi.org/10.9798/kosham.2020.20.1.339,"",,
rayyan-210772580,Investigation of the Impact of Land-Use Distribution on PM2.5 in Weifang: Seasonal Variations,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"As air pollution becomes highly focused in China, the accurate identification of its influencing factors is critical for achieving effective control and targeted environmental governance. Land-use distribution is one of the key factors affecting air quality, and research on the impact of land-use distribution on air pollution has drawn wide attention. However, considerable studies have mostly used linear regression models, which fail to capture the nonlinear effects of land-use distribution on PM2.5 (fine particulate matter with a diameter less than or equal to 2.5 microns) and to show how impacts on PM2.5 vary with land-use magnitudes. In addition, related studies have generally focused on annual analyses, ignoring the seasonal variability of the impact of land-use distribution on PM2.5, thus leading to possible estimation biases for PM2.5. This study was designed to address these issues and assess the impacts of land-use distribution on PM2.5 in Weifang, China. A machine learning statistical model, the boosted regression tree (BRT), was applied to measure nonlinear effects of land-use distribution on PM2.5, capture how land-use magnitude impacts PM2.5 across different seasons, and explore the policy implications for urban planning. The main conclusions are that the air quality will significantly improve with an increase in grassland and forest area, especially below 8% and 20%, respectively. When the distribution of construction land is greater than around 10%, the PM2.5 pollution can be seriously substantially increased with the increment of their areas. The impact of gardens and farmland presents seasonal characteristics. It is noted that as the weather becomes colder, the inhibitory effect of vegetation distribution on the PM2.5 concentration gradually decreases, while the positive impacts of artificial surface distributions, such as construction land and roads, are aggravated because leaves drop off in autumn (September–November) and winter (December–February). According to the findings of this study, it is recommended that Weifang should strengthen pollution control in winter, for instance, expand the coverage areas of evergreen vegetation like Pinus bungeana Zucc. and Euonymus japonicus Thunb, and increase the width and numbers of branches connecting different main roads. The findings also provide quantitative and optimal land-use planning and strategies to minimize PM2.5 pollution, referring to the status of regional urbanization and greening construction.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17145135,"",,
rayyan-210772592,Harnessing technology for mitigating water woes in the city of Bengaluru,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract Industrialization has caused most of the world’s environmental problems like climate change, water security issues, biodiversity issues among others. Water-related issues like water scarcity, lack of water quality, water sanitation issues, lack of proper water resources management are some of them. Urbanization, population increase, pollution has led to an increase in water demand. Water being the elixir of life, is essential for the day-to-day living of an individual. The Fourth Industrial Revolution technologies like AI, IoT, Blockchain, Machine Learning have the capability of bringing solutions to these issues. The current study focuses on the water woes of Bengaluru, a fast-growing urban city, due to its migrating population. The woes are also due to the irresponsible behaviour of builders converting lakes into real estate infrastructure leading to clogged drains, excess sewage creation and flooding. A huge mismatch between demand and supply of water is created due to these issues. Before the city hits the Day Zero – no water day, it is significant to set up water infrastructure along with technology implementation which will help resolve this burning issue at the earliest.","",https://doi.org/10.1088/1742-6596/1427/1/012004,"",,
rayyan-210772599,IDENTIFYING LAND USE AND LAND COVER (LULC) CHANGE FROM 2000 TO 2025 DRIVEN BY TOURISM GROWTH: A STUDY CASE IN BALI,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract. Bali has been open to tourism since the beginning of the 20th century and is known as the first tourist destination in Indonesia. The Denpasar, Badung, Gianyar, and Tabanan (Sarbagita) areas experience the most rapid growth of tourism activity in Bali. This rapid tourism growth has caused land use and land cover (LULC) to change drastically. This study mapped the land-use change in Bali from 2000 to 2025. The land change modeller (LCM) tool in ArcGIS was employed to conduct this analysis. The images were classified into agricultural land, open area, mangrove, vegetation/forest, and built-up area. Some Landsat images in 2000 and 2015 were exploited in predicting the land use and land cover (LULC) change in 2019 and 2025. To measure the accuracy of prediction, Landsat 8 OLI images for 2019 were classified and tested to verify the LULC model for 2019. The Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network was trained with two influencing factors: elevation and road network. The result showed that the built-up growth direction expanded from the Denpasar area to the neighbouring areas, and land was converted from agriculture, open area and vegetation/forest to built-up for all observation years. The built-up was predicted growing up to 43 % from 2015 to 2025. This model could support decision-makers in issuing a policy for monitoring LULC since the Kappa coefficients were more than 80% for all models.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/isprs-archives-xliii-b3-2020-1621-2020,"",,
rayyan-210772645,"Exploring the Dynamics of Urban Greenness Space and Their Driving Factors Using Geographically Weighted Regression: A Case Study in Wuhan Metropolis, China",,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Urban greenness plays a vital role in supporting the ecosystem services of a city. Exploring the dynamics of urban greenness space and their driving forces can provide valuable information for making solid urban planning policies. This study aims to investigate the dynamics of urban greenness space patterns through landscape indices and to apply geographically weighted regression (GWR) to map the spatially varied impact on the indices from economic and environmental factors. Two typical landscape indices, i.e., percentage of landscape (PLAND) and aggregation index (AI), which measure the abundance and fragmentation of urban greenness coverage, respectively, were taken to map the changes in urban greenness. As a case study, the metropolis of Wuhan, China was selected, where time-series of urban greenness space were extracted at an annual step from the Landsat collections from Google Earth Engine during 2000–2018. The study shows that the urban greenness space not only decreased significantly, but also tended to be more fragmented over the years. Road network density, normalized difference built-up index (NDBI), terrain elevation and slope, and precipitation were found to significantly correlate to the landscape indices. GWR modeling successfully captures the spatially varied impact from the considered factors and the results from GWR modeling provide a critical reference for making location-specific urban planning.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/land9120500,"",,
rayyan-210772714,Analysis of Urban Heat Island (UHI) Alleviating Effect of Urban Parks and Green Space in Seoul Using Deep Neural Network (DNN) Model,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"The Urban Heat Island (UHI) Effect has intensified due to urbanization and heat management at the urban level is treated as an important issue. Green space improvement projects and environmental policies are being implemented as a way to alleviate Urban Heat Islands. Several studies have been conducted to analyze the correlation between urban green areas and heat with linear regression models. However, linear regression models have limitations explaining the correlation between heat and the multitude of variables as heat is a result of a combination of non-linear factors. This study evaluated the Heat Island alleviating effects in Seoul during the summer by using a deep neural network model methodology, which has strengths in areas where it is difficult to analyze data with existing statistical analysis methods due to variable factors and a large amount of data. Wide-area data was acquired using Landsat 8. Seoul was divided into a grid (30m x 30m) and the heat island reduction variables were enter in each grid space to create a data structure that is needed for the construction of a deep neural network using ArcGIS 10.7 and Python3.7 with Keras. This deep neural network was used to analyze the correlation between land surface temperature and the variables. We confirmed that the deep neural network model has high explanatory accuracy. It was found that the cooling effect by NDVI was the greatest, and cooling effects due to the park size and green space proximity were also shown. Previous studies showed that the cooling effects related to park size was 2°C-3°C, and the proximity effect was found to lower the temperature 0.3°C-2.3°C. There is a possibility of overestimation of the results of previous studies. The results of this study can provide objective information for the justification and more effective formation of new urban green areas to alleviate the Urban Heat Island phenomenon in the future.","",https://doi.org/10.9715/kila.2020.48.4.019,"",,

Evapotranspiration (ET) in urban areas mitigates the urban heat island and controls the irrigation water demand of green spaces. In this study, we mapped the urban ET of Berlin, Germany using Sentinel-2 and open geodata, machine learning (ML), and footprint modeling in high spatial (10-m) and temporal (hourly) resolution. Footprint modeling of two urban flux towers allowed us to incorporate various land covers in training the ML models. Open remote sensing and geodata used to model urban ET includes Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from Sentinel-2, building height, impervious surface fraction, vegetation fraction, and vegetation height. Predictions were carried out using random forest regression. Daily ET was simulated for the entire city during and before a heat wave event in June 2019.

This article surveys and analyses a database of disasters in a medium-sized municipality, using official (civil defense) and unofficial (documentary research) sources. The methodology was based on data collection between 1970 and 2021, being classified according to the Brazilian Disaster Codification (COBRADE), and subsequent spatialization of information. The results indicated that 71% of hazard events were registered in the ""natural group"" (NG), mostly related to heavy rainfall, and 29% in the ""technological group"" (TG), these mostly associated with urban fires. Based on the spatial analysis, 20 locations (""hotspots"") with the largest occurrences were identified, which represented about 64.30% of (NG) total records. The city central zone was the location with the highest number of occurrences (133), followed by Jardim Kennedy (64), in the South zone, and Serra São Domingos (53), in the North. The methodology developed is an important tool to support urban planning and disaster risk management in medium-sized cities.

rayyan-210773347,CHAIR-consortium: A collaboration for air pollution research across India,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Ambient air pollution levels in India are among the highest in the world and contribute to climate change and poor health. Despite extreme levels of air pollution and increased frequency and intensity of heat waves in India, current Indian public policy to reduce emissions has been inadequate and lacked a coordinated and sustained effort. Planned coal power plants will additionally contribute to both more CO2 and air pollution emissions. Moreover, lack of monitoring in rural areas has contributed to a belief that air pollution is only an urban problem. To address this we have developed an exposure assessment methodology employing machine-learning methods and multiple data sources including monitoring data, satellite data, meteorology and land-use data to make reliable high resolution predictions of particulate matter <2.5 µm in diameter (PM2.5) and temperature in areas with sparse monitoring. We will develop a nation-wide exposure model for daily ambient PM2.5 and ambient temperature from 2008-2020 at a spatial resolution of 1 km x 1 km and locally at 200 m x 200 m in India. Our aim is to link our national estimates of PM2.5 and temperature to health data to quantify the associations between PM2.5 and ambient temperature, independently and jointly on major public health endpoints. Our specific intention is to make the exposure model an open resource to accelerate environmental epidemiology and build capacity around the many existing health studies in India to which the exposure model can be applied. We will develop an online interactive environmental database and a strategy for stakeholder communication to significantly facilitate decision-making and increase public awareness and engagement. Successful fulfillment of our aims in India will significantly contribute to sustainable development benefitting not only the very large Indian population but also the global community.","",https://doi.org/10.1289/isee.2020.virtual.o-sy-1428,"",,

With advent of high definition satellite images, high resolution data, computational methods such as deep neural network, capable hardware; urban planning is seeing a paradigm shift. Legacy data on urban environments are now being complemented with high-volume, high-frequency data. In this paper we propose a novel classification method that is readily usable for machine analysis and show applicability of the methodology on a developing world setting. The state-of-the-art is mostly dominated by classification of building structures, building types etc. and largely represents the developed world which are insufficient for developing countries such as Bangladesh where the surrounding is crucial for the classification. Moreover, the traditional methods propose small-scale classifications, which give limited information with poor scalability and are slow to compute. We categorize the urban area in terms of informal and formal spaces taking the surroundings into account. 50 km x 50 km Google Earth image of Dhaka, Bangladesh was visually annotated and categorized by an expert. The classification is based broadly on two dimensions: urbanization and the architectural form of urban environment. Consequently, the urban space is divided into four classes: 1) highly informal; 2) moderately informal; 3) moderately formal; and 4) highly formal areas. In total 16 sub-classes were identified. For semantic segmentation, Google's DeeplabV3+ model was used which increases the field of view of the filters to incorporate larger context. Image encompassing 70% of the urban space was used for training and the remaining 30% was used for testing and validation. The model is able to segment with 75% accuracy and 60% Mean IoU.","",https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2011.12847,"",,
rayyan-210773477,Global contribution of JAR to a more disaster‐resilient society,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"In recent years, Japan has been repeatedly exposed to natural disasters such as extremely large and violent typhoons (tropical cyclones), torrential rain, etc. Western Japan was hit by torrential storms in 2018, and eastern and northern Japan in 2019. These brought record-breaking rainfall and winds to multiple areas, causing landslides, flash flooding, inundation, etc. An event that a Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) official describes as “heavy rain at a level we have never experienced” repeats every year! They are the worst rain disasters we have seen, causing the highest death tolls due to rainfall in the last three decades or more in Japan. This also left a large number of people without electricity and communication. Even a high-rise tower condominium in the urban center continued to experience electricity and water outages for a long time after the storm because the electrical systems in the basement had been damaged by flooding. As global warming progresses, Japan is likely to face more frequent heavy rains. Huge earthquakes of the same level as the 2011 Great East Japan earthquake have been also another critical threat to Japan. Scientists and citizens are apprehensive about predictions of a super-huge Nankai Trough earthquake expected in the mid-2000s. As has been well recognized, disasters evolved over time. The evolution of modern cities creates convenient and efficient human lifestyles but it may also create unexpected vulnerability to disasters, which we may be suddenly exposed to. Natural hazards are inevitable, but their impacts can be mitigated through proactive and reactive approaches. In the earthquake engineering community that I have been deeply involved with, various, long, and extensive efforts have been made such as the development and revision of seismic codes for building construction, seismic evaluation and rehabilitation techniques for existing buildings, and development and practical application of innovative technologies for both, etc. In addition to these conventional efforts, modern society existing under complex social systems with advanced technologies may also need immediately applicable research outputs as well as fundamental researches to make society really disaster-resilient and to minimize the disruption of societal activities after an event. To this end, comprehensive researches under industry-academia-government cooperation are ongoing in Japan. They are utilizing cutting-edge technologies from various related fields such as ICT, AI, satellites and drones, sensing, high-performance computing as well as the most updated scientific knowledge. The Cross-ministerial Strategic Innovation Promotion Programs (SIP and SIP2) that were launched to contribute to a safer and more resilient society for future generations is one such research effort. Another key factor is not falling into the so-called technological “valley of death” due to a gap between academic research and societal implementation. These problems and the proposed solutions to make society more disaster-resilient are not local to Japan and should, therefore, be shared among related countries and regions. In recent years, more efforts have been increasingly directed toward mutual understanding and knowledge sharing through international collaboration and joint researches between developed and developing countries. The best solution in one area may not always be so in another area and it may often need to be customized to fit the needs and availability of each societal environment. As has been noted in the earlier Editorial, the Japan Architectural Review: the International Journal of the Japan Architectural Review for Engineering and Design is an open access journal. Your articles published in the journal undoubtedly contribute to solving such global issues. All AIJ members are therefore strongly encouraged to submit your articles to JAR and to share your research outputs and ideas with the world.","",https://doi.org/10.1002/2475-8876.12145,"",,

rayyan-210773664,Use of Cellular Automata-Based Artificial Neural Networks For Detection and Prediction of Land Use Changes in North Eastern Dhaka City,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract The purpose of this study was to examine the pattern of change in Land Use Land Cover (LULC) and Land Surface Temperature (LST) in Mirpur and its surrounding area (north-eastern part of Dhaka) over the last 30 years using Landsat Satellite images and remote sensing indices, and to develop relationships between LULC types and LST, as well as to analyze their impact on local warming. Using this analyzed data, a further projection of LULC and LST change over the next two decades was made. From 1989 to 2019, five-year intervals of Landsat 4-5 TM and Landsat 8 OLI pictures were utilized to track the relationship between LULC changes and LST. Cellular Automata-based Artificial Neural Network (CA-ANN) algorithm was used to model the LULC and LST maps for the year 2039. Two environmental indices were analyzed to determine their link with LST: the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Normalized Difference Built-up Index (NDBI). The link between LST and LULC types indicates that built-up area raises LST by substituting non-evaporating surfaces for natural vegetation. The average surface temperature has been increasing steadily for the previous 30 years. For the year 2019, it was determined that roughly 86 percent of total land area has been converted to built-up area and that 89 percent of land area has an LST greater than 28°C. According to the study, if the current trend continues, 72 percent of the Mirpur area is predicted to see temperatures near 32°C in 2039. Additionally, LST had a significant positive association with NDBI and a negative correlation with NDVI. The overall accuracy of LULC was greater than 90%, with a Kappa coefficient of 0.83. The study may assist urban planners and environmental engineers in comprehending and recommending effective policy measures and plans to mitigate the consequences of LULC.","",https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-993126/v1,"",,

The Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, as one of the most developed megacities in China, sets up a goal of high-quality development while fostering ecosystem services. Therefore, assessing the ecosystem services in this study area is very important to guide further development. However, the spatial pattern of ecosystem services, especially at local scales, is not well understood. Using the available 2017 land cover product, Sentinel-1 SAR and Sentinel-2 optical images, a deep learning land cover mapping framework integrating deep change vector analysis and the ResUnet model was proposed. Based on the produced 10 m land cover map for the year 2020, recent spatial patterns of the ecosystem services at different scales (i.e., the GBA, 11 cities, urban–rural gradient, and pixel) were analyzed. The results showed that: (1) Forest was the primary land cover in Guangzhou, Huizhou, Shenzhen, Zhuhai, Jiangmen, Zhaoqing, and Hong Kong, and an impervious surface was the main land cover in the other four cities. (2) Although ecosystem services in the GBA were sufficient to meet their demand, there was undersupply for all the three general services in Macao and for the provision services in Zhongshan, Dongguan, Shenzhen, and Foshan. (3) Along the urban–rural gradient in the GBA, supply and demand capacity showed an increasing and decreasing trend, respectively. As for the city-level analysis, Huizhou and Zhuhai showed a fluctuation pattern while Jiangmen, Zhaoqing, and Hong Kong presented a decreasing pattern along the gradient. (4) Inclusion of neighborhood landscape led to increased demand scores in a small proportion of impervious areas and oversupply for a very large percent of bare land.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/su13137044,"",,

Enterprise-scale geographic information system (GIS) software and high-resolution aerial or satellite imagery are tools which are typically not available to or affordable for resource-limited communities. In this paper, we present a concept of aerial data collection, 3D cadastre modeling, and disaster risk assessment using low-cost drones and adapted open-source software. Computer vision/machine learning methods are used to create a classified 3D cadastre that contextualizes and quantifies potential natural disaster risk to existing or planned infrastructure. Building type and integrity are determined from aerial imagery. Potential flood damage risk to a building is evaluated as a function of three mechanisms: undermining (erosion) of the foundation, hydraulic pressure damage, and building collapse due to water load. Use of Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) provides water runoff estimates that are improved using classified land features (urban ecology, erosion marks) to improve flow direction estimates. A convolutional neural network (CNN) is trained to find these flood-induced erosion marks from high-resolution drone imagery. A flood damage potential metric scaled by property value estimates results in individual and community property risk assessments.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/rs13091739,"",,

This research developed a new computational framework to investigate four main dimensions of vulnerability (environmental, social, economic and physical). An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) Model and a SWOT-Quantitative Strategic Planning Matrix (QSPM) were applied. Firstly, a literature review was performed to explore indicators with significant impact on aforementioned dimensions of vulnerability to earthquakes. Next, the twenty identified indicators were analyzed in ArcGIS, a geographic information system (GIS) software, to map earthquake vulnerability. After classification and reclassification of the layers, standardized maps were presented as input to a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and Self-Organizing Map (SOM) neural network. The resulting Earthquake Vulnerability Maps (EVMs) showed five categories of vulnerability ranging from very high, to high, moderate, low and very low. Accordingly, out of the nine municipality zones in Tabriz city, Zone one was rated as the most vulnerable to earthquakes while Zone seven was rated as the least vulnerable. Vulnerability to earthquakes of residential buildings was also identified. To validate the results data were compared between a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and a Self-Organizing Map (SOM). The scatter plots showed strong correlations between the vulnerability ratings of the different zones achieved by the SOM and MLP. Finally, the hybrid SWOT-QSPM paradigm was proposed to identify and evaluate strategies for hazard mitigation of the most vulnerable zone. For hazard mitigation in this zone we recommend to diligently account for environmental phenomena in designing and locating of sites. The findings are useful for decision makers and government authorities to reconsider current natural disaster management strategies.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/rs13224519,"",,

rayyan-210774146,A Forecasting and Prediction Methodology for Improving the Blue Economy Resilience to Climate Change in the Romanian Lower Danube Euroregion,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"European Union (EU) policy encourages the development of a blue economy (BE) by unlocking the full economic potential of oceans, seas, lakes, rivers and other water resources, especially in member countries in which it represents a low contribution to the national economy (under 1%). However, climate change represents a main barrier to fully realizing a BE. Enabling conditions that will support the sustainable development of a BE and increase its climate resiliency must be promoted. Romania has high potential to contribute to the development of the EU BE due to its geographic characteristics, namely the presence of the Danube Delta-Black Sea macrosystem, which is part of the Romanian Lower Danube Euroregion (RLDE). Aquatic living resources represent a sector which can significantly contribute to the growth of the BE in the RLDE, a situation which imposes restrictions for both halting biodiversity loss and maintaining the proper conditions to maximize the benefits of the existing macrosystem. It is known that climate change causes water quality problems, accentuates water level fluctuations and loss of biodiversity and induces the destruction of habitats, which eventually leads to fish stock depletion. This paper aims to develop an analytical framework based on multiple linear predictive and forecast models that offers cost-efficient tools for the monitoring and control of water quality, fish stock dynamics and biodiversity in order to strengthen the resilience and adaptive capacity of the BE of the RLDE in the context of climate change. The following water-dependent variables were considered: total nitrogen (TN); total phosphorus (TP); dissolved oxygen (DO); pH; water temperature (wt); and water level, all of which were measured based on a series of 26 physicochemical indicators associated with 4 sampling areas within the RLDE (Brăila, Galați, Tulcea and Sulina counties). Predictive models based on fish species catches associated with the Galati County Danube River Basin segment and the “Danube Delta” Biosphere Reserve Administration territory were included in the analytical framework to establish an efficient tool for monitoring fish stock dynamics and structures as well as identify methods of controlling fish biodiversity in the RLDE to enhance the sustainable development and resilience of the already-existing BE and its expansion (blue growth) in the context of aquatic environment climate variation. The study area reflects the integrated approach of the emerging BE, focused on the ocean, seas, lakes and rivers according to the United Nations Agenda. The results emphasized the vulnerability of the RLDE to climate change, a situation revealed by the water level, air temperature and water quality parameter trend lines and forecast models. Considering the sampling design applied within the RLDE, it can be stated that the Tulcea county Danube sector was less affected by climate change compared with the Galați county sector as confirmed by water TN and TP forecast analysis, which revealed higher increasing trends in Galați compared with Tulcea. The fish stock biodiversity was proven to be affected by global warming within the RLDE, since peaceful species had a higher upward trend compared with predatory species. Water level and air temperature forecasting analysis proved to be an important tool for climate change monitoring in the study area. The resulting analytical framework confirmed that time series methods could be used together with machine learning prediction methods to highlight their synergetic abilities for monitoring and predicting the impact of climate change on the marine living resources of the BE sector within the RLDE. The forecasting models developed in the present study were meant to be used as methods of revealing future information, making it possible for decision makers to adopt proper management solutions to prevent or limit the negative impacts of climate change on the BE. Through the identified independent variables, prediction models offer a solution for managing the dependent variables and the possibility of performing less cost-demanding aquatic environment monitoring activities.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/su132111563,"",,
rayyan-210774273,Associations between Urban Street and Ecosystem Services Perception Assessed from Street-View Images by Machine Learning,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Rapid urbanization seriously affects the performance of ecosystem services. Most previous studies on measuring ecosystem service functions have focused on natural environments such as green spaces, wetlands, and forests. However, public spaces like urban streets, despite being tightly connected to residents’ daily activities, have received little attention. In this study, we applied machine learning classification to street view images to assess how urban street environment characteristics affect eight ecosystem services perceptions. Spatial analyses were applied to reveal correlations between street view features and perceptions. The study demonstrated that streets around blue–green spaces and high-quality built environments in urban centers are more likely to produce high levels of perceptions. In contrast, streets surrounding industrial areas and high-density built environments are more likely to generate low levels of perceptions. The spatial regression results showed that “greenness” is the variable most robustly and positively correlated with perceptions. “Hard landscape ratio” and “pedestrian–vehicle proportion” are significantly and negatively associated with perceptions. The findings of this study can contribute to a better understanding of ecosystem services perception in urban streets and provide new insights and perspectives on maintaining and enhancing the ecosystem service functions of urban public spaces.","",https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4581492,"",,

Rainstorms and waterlogging have become one of the most common natural disasters in the coastal areas of China. As a result, the concept of an ecological sponge city was incorporated into the construction of cities in the future. Taking Shenzhen–Shantou special cooperation zone (SSCZ), we constructed a storm flooding model based on the SCS flow generation model and GIS to explore the spatial distribution characteristics of the flooding risk in a rainstorm of 100-year lasting 1 h. Combined with population and economic indicators, a radial basis function (RBF) network was utilized to evaluate the environmental risk, the vulnerability of disaster-bearing bodies, and the rain–flood resilience of sponge cities. The self-organizing feature mapping (SOFM) model was used for cluster analysis. Spatial differences were found in the construction suitability of the study area. A suitable construction area (73.59% of the entire area) was located downtown. The construction of the artificial spongy body in the highest vulnerable area (3.25%) needs to be strengthened. The control construction area (3.3%) is located along the banks of the river, with relatively high risk and low resilience of flood control engineering. Ecological construction (19.85%) serves as the sponge body of ecological buffer. The factors of waterlogging, ecology, population, and economy could be integrated comprehensively by applying neural network methods for urban planning and construction.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/land10080872,"",,
rayyan-210774294,Modeling Urban Futures: Data-Driven Scenarios of Climate Change and Vulnerability in Cities,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract Cities are complex systems where social, ecological, and technological processes are deeply coupled. This coupling complicates urban planning and land use development, as changing one facet of the urban fabric will likely impact the others. As cities grapple with climate change, there is a growing need to envision urban futures that not only address more frequent and intense severe weather events but also improve day-to-day livability. Here we examine climate risks as functions of the local land use with numerical models. These models leverage a wide array of data sources, from satellite imagery to tax assessments and land cover. We then present a machine-learning cellular automata approach to combine historical land use change with local coproduced urban future scenarios. The cellular automata model uses historical and ancillary data like existing road systems and natural features to develop a set of probabilistic land use change rules, which are then modified according to stakeholder priorities. The resulting land use scenarios are evaluated against historical flood hazards, showcasing how they perform against stakeholder expectations. Our work shows that coproduced scenarios, when grounded with historical and emerging data, can provide paths that increase resilience to weather hazards as well as enhancing ecosystem services provided to citizens.","",https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-63131-4_9,"",,

It is crucial to map different weed species and analyze their physiological activities. Remote sensing techniques for plant identification, especially hyperspectral imaging, are being developed using spectral response patterns to vegetation for detection and species identification. A library of hyperspectral images of 40 urban weed species in northeast China was established in this study. A terrestrial hyperspectral camera was used to acquire 435 hyperspectral images. The hyperspectral information for each weed species was extracted and analyzed. The spectral characteristics and vegetation indices of different weeds revealed the differences between weed species in the cities of northeast China and indirectly characterized the growth and physiological activity levels of different species, but could not effectively distinguish different species. Five methods—first derivative spectrum (FDS), second derivative spectrum (SDS), standard normal variate (SNV), moving averages (MA), and Savitzky-Golay (SG) smoothing—were used to pretreat the spectral curves to maximize the retention of spectral characteristics while removing the influence of noise. We investigated the application of a convolutional neural network (CNN) with terrestrial hyperspectral remote sensing to identify urban weeds in northeast China. A CNN classification model was established to distinguish weeds from the hyperspectral images and demonstrated a test accuracy of 95.32% to 98.15%. The accuracy of the original spectrum was 97.45%; SNV had the best accuracy (98.15%) and SG was the least accurate (95.32%). This provides a baseline for understanding the hyperspectral characteristics of urban weed species and monitoring their growth.

As a result, monitoring such areas is essential to provide information and support decision-makers and urban planners, especially in case of disaster recovery. Here, we developed an approach to monitor the urban deprived areas over a four-year period after super Typhoon Haiyan, which struck Tacloban city, in the Philippines, in 2013, using high-resolution satellite images and machine learning methods. A Support Vector Machine classification method supported by a local binary patterns feature extraction model was initially performed to detect slum areas in the pre-disaster, just after/event, and post-disaster images. Afterward, a dense conditional random fields model was employed to produce the final slum areas maps. The developed method detected slum areas with accuracies over 83%. We produced the damage and recovery maps based on change analysis over the detected slum areas. The results revealed that most of the slum areas were reconstructed 4 years after Typhoon Haiyan, and thus, the city returned to the pre-existing vulnerability level.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/cli9040058,"",,

Therefore, in order to protect the ecological environment, regulate urban development and pursue the maximization of ecological benefits, it is necessary to analyze, simulate and predict land use change. In this study, Hengyang City was taken as the study area, and based on the current land use data of Hengyang City in 2010, 2015, and 2018, the land use type transfer during 2010–2015 and 2015–2018 was analyzed. Then, starting from 2010, the FLUS model was used to simulate the spatial distribution of land use in 2015 and 2018, and then the spatial distribution of land use in Hengyang City in 2025 was predicted with the Markov prediction method under the premise of ecological protection priority. The results show that the change in ecological land in Hengyang City is mainly distributed in the surrounding and marginal areas, because the topography of Hengyang City is a basin. Changes in land type in Hengyang City in 2015 were subtle and difficult to observe. However, in 2018, the transformation of non-ecological land into ecological land was obvious, and the distribution area of ecological land expanded significantly. The Kappa index of the results simulated by the FLUS model based on neural network is above 0.72, and overall accuracy is above 0.9, which is highly consistent with the actual situation.

As relevant studies have increased rapidly during past decades, the methods used to combine data extracted from land use land cover (LULC) surveys and remote sensing-based products and track or report sources of uncertainty vary notably. This paper reviews six data sources that are most commonly used to investigate LULC and change in the contiguous U.S. by highlighting the main characteristics, strengths and weaknesses and considering how uncertainty is assessed by the June Area Survey (JAS), the Census of Agriculture (COA), the Farm Survey Agency (FSA) acreage, the National Resources Inventory (NRI), the National Wetlands Inventory (NWI), and the Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA); and two remote sensing-based data products, the Cropland Data Layer (CDL) and the National Land Cover Database (NLCD). The summary and conclusion identify important research gaps or challenges limiting current land use/land cover and change studies (e.g., lack of high-quality reference data and uncertainty quantification, etc.) and opportunities and emerging techniques (data fusion and machine learning) that will improve reliability of land use/land cover assessments and associated policies. Blended approaches that marry high quality ground truth data that are more finely resolved than data supplied by government surveys with multitemporal imagery are needed track use of non-agricultural lands vulnerable to agricultural expansion. These considerations are notably important as the U.S. considers the renewal and possibly revision of its Renewable Fuel Standard, which includes provisions that require monitoring of agricultural land expansion.","",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envsci.2021.12.021,"",,

The work aims to determine whether green areas are more significant in cities where above-normal wet events have plateaued. This work compares the green surface cover characteristics of the entire city and identified zones of 54 cities representing cities worldwide. These cities experience varying amounts of above-normal weather conditions. This article classifies the cities in the data set into two groups: Group 1 – frequency of extreme wet weather events has plateaued, and Group 2 – frequency of extreme weather events are increasing or decreasing at higher rates. Next, the work uses structural features of co-located spatial networks, roads and terrain, to identify zones. Finally, high-resolution satellite imagery quantified urban green spaces in the city and identified zones of the two city groups using geospatial and machine learning methods for 2000 and 2020. The data is compared for two groups to understand the pattern of green spaces in cities. Empirical analysis results recognise a higher greenness index in the zones and the entire city amongst the cities of Group1. The pattern in the temporal change in the greenness index of the zones is helpful to formulate a priority plan for locating inter-linked green spaces in urban areas paving the way for Nature-based Solutions. The findings can guide planners and policy-makers to identify and prioritise locations to incorporate a robust green infrastructure network to build resilient cities by 'nature bringing a solution', the essential concept of Nature-based Solutions.","",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nbsj.2021.100008,"",,

Urban and under-development communities are often hit the most during disasters. Disaster resilience requires proper planning and timely response. Recently, there has been growing interest in the potentials of computer vision and artificial intelligence to tackle challenges related to disaster resilience and emergency preparedness. Compared to cities, detecting structural buildings in urban environments is a more challenging task. Within this context, this paper presents a novel lightweight multiscale attention-aware method for semantic segmentation of urban structural buildings in drone aerial imagery. Detailed experiments were conducted to evaluate our proposed method using drone aerial images from Zanzibar city, Tanzania. Despite being lightweight, significant performance gains were achieved compared to relevant state-of-the-art methods in the literature.","",https://doi.org/10.1109/miucc58832.2023.10278371,"",,

To date, multiple land uses are experiencing urban construction-related land expansion, population increase, and socioeconomic development. Comprehensive evaluation and understanding of the effect of urban sprawl and its rapid LUCC are of great importance to managing land surface resources for sustainable development. The present research applied remote sensing data, such as Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper and Landsat-8 Operation Land Imager, on selected images between July and August from 1985 to 2020 with the use of multiple types of software to explore, classify, and analyze the historical and future LUCCs in Baghdad City. Three historical LUCC maps from 1985, 2000, and 2020 were created and analyzed. The result shows that urban construction land expands quickly, and agricultural land and natural vegetation have had a large loss of coverage during the last 35 years. The change analysis derived from previous land use was used as a change direction for future simulation, where natural and anthropogenic factors were selected as the drivers’ variables in the process of multilayer perceptron neural network Markov chain model. The future land use/cover change (FLUCC) modeling results from 2030 to 2050 show that agriculture is the only land use type with a massive decreasing trend from 1985 to 2050 compared with other categories. The entire change in urban sprawl derived from historical and FLUCC in each period shows that urban construction land increases the fastest between 2020 and 2030. The rapid urbanization along with unplanned urban growth and rising population migration from rural to urban is the main driver of all transformation in land use. These findings facilitate sustainable ecological development in Baghdad City and theoretically support environmental decision making.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/rs13204034,"",,

Due to its ecological and economic significance, the Sundarbans Delta is a crucial tidal- influenced region for Bangladesh and India. The study used a Random Forest machine learning technique to assess the land use and land cover (LULC) changes of the low-lying Sundarbans delta, and it used a Cellular Automata approach combined with an Artificial Neural Network (CA-ANN) to model LULC. The accuracy of both user and producer ranges from 100-85% for the Mangrove and 100-79% for the surrounding waterbodies. Results show that over the decades, the thick, dense mangrove coverage of the Sundarbans has receded while the width of the intricate network of channels has increased, and the spatial coverage of water bodies has risen. The spatial vegetation index shows that the average minimum Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) for all months from 1990 to 2020 is not consistent, varying from -0.72 to 0.85. The month of November has the lowest negative NDVI (-0.716), while June has the least low negative NDVI (-0.48). This negative NDVI primarily indicates the extent and severity of flooding in the Sundarbans Delta during the monsoon season. In 1970, the mangrove coverage was at 65%, but by 2020 it had dropped to 59%. In the period between 1990 and 2015, the coverage of channels in the Sundarbans increased from 33% to 43%. The study also showed that built-up and barren land areas were slowly increasing. Water bodies were encroaching on the mangrove forest, which could be due to rising sea levels or deforestation. The analysis revealed that mangroves in the Sundarbans Delta have decreased from 65% to 59% of the total area of the delta during the study period. Temporary human settlements were also visible in the area. The most significant changes were seen in the southern part of the delta, which is more vulnerable to sea level rise. The water bodies fluctuated across the mangrove forests because many rivers and channels crisscross the Sundarbans delta. Future simulation for the years 2030-2050 revealed a decline in mangrove coverage from about 63.5% to 56.7%, while the total area of water bodies will increase from 33.9% to 39.8%.

rayyan-210774961,MODELING THE DEVELOPMENTS IN URBANISATION AND RELATIONSHIP WITH VEGETATION COVER IN ALANYA,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract. The increase in the world population and the migration of people from rural to urban areas causes an increase in artificial surfaces and causes many negative effects on the ecosystem, regional climate variations and global diversity. Nowadays, as the effects of climate change are felt more and more, it has gained importance in researches on this subject. Therefore, the estimation of the change in the vegetation density for the coming years and the determination of the land use / land cover (LULC) change in cities are very essential for urban planning. In this study, the effects of regional urbanization on vegetation are examined by using satellite data and atmospheric variables. In the vegetation analysis, multi-time index values obtained from TERRA-MODIS satellite, EVI (Enhanced Vegetation Index) and LST (Land Surface Temperature) were taken into account between the years of 2005 and 2018 in Alanya, Turkey. Temperature and precipitation were selected as the atmospheric variables and expected variations in EVI value until 2030 were estimated. In the study employed a wavelet-transformed artificial neural network (WANN) model to generate long-term (12-year) EVI forecasts using LST, temperature and precipitation. The relationship between land use / land cover and urbanization is investigated with NDBI (Normalized Difference Built-up Index) data obtained from the Landsat 8 OLI / TIRS satellite sensor. The simulation results show that The EVI value, which was 0.30 in 2018, will decrease to 0.25 in 2030.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/isprs-archives-xlvi-4-w5-2021-291-2021,"",,

We propose a framework combining AI and simulation which may be useful for extracting indicators from remote-sensing images and may help with predictive estimation of future states of these climate-adaptation-related indicators. When such models become more robust and used in real life applications, they may help decision makers and early responders to choose the best actions to sustain the well-being of society, natural resources and biodiversity. We underline that this is an open field and an on-going area of research for many scientists, therefore we offer an in-depth discussion on the challenges and limitations of data-driven methods and the predictive estimation models in general.","",https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2107.02693,"",,
rayyan-210775133,Influence of urban land-use change on cold-air path occurrence and spatial distribution,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract The urban population is predicted to reach a 70% share of global population by mid-century. Future urbanization might be directed along several development typologies, e.g. sprawling urbanization, more compact cities, greener cities, or a combination of different typologies. These developments induce urban land-use change that will affect urban climate and might reinforce phenomena such as the urban heat island and thermal discomfort of urban residents. A planning-based mitigation approach to ensure thermal comfort of residents are urban cold-air paths, i.e. low-roughness areas enabling drainage and transport of colder air masses from rural surroundings. We study how urban land-use change scenarios influence cold-air path occurrence probability and spatial distribution in a mid-European city using a machine learning approach, i.e. boosted regression trees. The Urban Sprawl Scenario results in the strongest reduction of cold-air path area by 3.6% in comparison to the reference case. The Green City Scenario gives evidence for an increase of cold-air path area (2.2%) whereas the Compact Green City Scenario partly counteracts the negative influence of urban densification by increased fractions of vegetated areas. The proposed method allows for the identification of priority areas for cold-air path preservation in urban planning.","",https://doi.org/10.1007/s43762-021-00026-7,"",,

Heavy traffic, unexpected geohazards are some of the effects of uncontrollable development. This situation points its fingerto urban planning and design; there are numerous automation tools to help urban planners assess and forecast, yet unplanned development still occurs, impeding sustainability. Automation tools use machine learning classification models to analyze spatial data and various trend views before planning a new urban development. Although there are many sophisticated tools and massive datasets, big cities with colossal migration still witness traffic jams, pollution, and environmental degradation affecting urban dwellers' quality. This study will analyze the current predictors in urban planning machine learning models and identify the suitable predictors to support sustainable urban planning. A correct set of predictors could improve the efficiency of the urban development classification models and help urban planners to enhance the quality of life in big cities.","",https://doi.org/10.14569/ijacsa.2021.0120787,"",,

rayyan-210775396,Monitoring air quality using remote sensing based on a Google Earth engine application in countries with limited air quality data and control policies: a case study in Ecuador,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Currently, remote sensing applications are more diverse and numerous than when remote sensing was introduced as an environmental monitoring technology. New satellite options have appeared recently to monitor agricultural operations, environmental change, geological activity, and other Earth system processes in tandem with new data science approaches, including machine and deep learning cloud-based computing. Air emissions monitoring has recently emerged as an important application of remote sensing, particularly after introducing the Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) sensor aboard satellite Sentinel-5P. This high spatio-temporal resolution sensor was launched in 2017. The sensor collects daily aerosol, carbon monoxide (CO), formaldehyde, nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), ozone (O<sub>3</sub>), sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>), and methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) concentrations providing global coverage. Due to the sensor's characteristics, Sentinel-5P images constitute an alternative to urban air quality without needing other ground-based devices or methodologies. Moreover, with the development of cloud computing applications such as Google Earth Engine (GEE), which allows faster and more efficient access to remote sensing resources than traditional desktop environments, objective evaluations of environmental change can be done more effectively today than in the past. This study presents a novel methodology to build Sentinel-5p-based air quality control applications using GEE. We present an application that focuses on the Ecuadorian mainland. The application allows users to observe the CO, NO<sub>2</sub>, and O<sub>3</sub> concentration at the province level as an interactive color map during user-determined periods. Thus, users can compare air pollution concentrations in particular areas of interest at different times. We validated the remote sensing-based air quality measurements using Quito's Air Quality Monitoring Network (REEMAQ) data. Results showed stronger correlations between ground and remote remotely sensed measurements for NO<sub>2</sub> (R<sup>2</sup> =0.61 and RMSE= 2.669 for the training data; R<sup>2</sup>= 0.58 and RMSE=2.627 for validation data) than for any other pollutants. The product is available at the link https://cesarivanalvarezmendoza.users.earthengine.app/view/sentinel5p. Diverse municipalities can replicate the application in developing countries with insufficient air quality monitoring resources. In addition, intuitive tools, such as those developed in this study, could help promote air quality policies to improve urban citizens' living standards.","",https://doi.org/10.1117/12.2672325,"",,

We find that while most violence currently occurs in rural areas, it also exhibits a classic distance-decay effect, commonly occurring near urbanized places. Regional differences are evident as Jihadist-led violence is increasingly rural in West Africa while urban violence was more common in North Africa. Important difference in states with major conflict are also present, exemplified by urbanized violence in Nigeria and rural violence in Mali.

rayyan-210775414,Promoting disaster preparedness and resilience by co-developing stakeholder support tools for managing the systemic risk of compounding disasters,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Stakeholders in disaster risk management are faced with the challenge to adapt their risk reduction policies and emergency plans to cascading and compounding events, but often lack the tools to account for the cross-sectoral impacts and dynamic nature of the risks involved. The EU Horizon Europe PARATUS project, which started in October 2022 and will run to October 2026, aims to fill this gap by developing an open-source online platform for dynamic risk assessment that allows to analyze and evaluate multi-hazard impact chains, dynamic risk reduction measures, and disaster response scenarios in the light of systemic vulnerabilities and uncertainties. These services will be co-developed within a transdisciplinary consortium of 19 partners, consisting of research organizations, NGOs, SMEs, first and second responders, and local and regional authorities. To gain a deeper understanding of multi-hazard impact chains, PARATUS conducts forensic analysis of historical disaster events, based on a database of learning case studies, augments historical disaster databases with hazard interactions and sectorial impacts, and exploits remote sensing data with artificial intelligence methods. Building on these insights, PARATUS will then develop new exposure and vulnerability analysis methods that enable systemic risk assessment across sectors (e.g. humanitarian, transportation, communication) and geographic settings (e.g. islands, mountains, megacities). These methods will be used to analyze risk changes across space and time and to develop new scenarios and risk mitigation options together with stakeholders, using innovative serious games and social simulations.The methods developed in PARATUS have been applied in four application case studies. The first one is related to Small Island Developing States (SIDS) in the Caribbean. This case study considers the cross-border impacts of tropical storms, tsunamis, volcanic eruptions, and space weather, and focuses on the development of impact-based forecasting, directed at humanitarian response planning, the telecommunication sector, and tourism. The second case study deals with the local and regional economic impact of hazardous events such as extreme wind, floods, rockfall, mudflow, landslides, and snow avalanches on cross-border transportation in the Alps. The third case study relates to the multi-hazard impact of large earthquakes in the Bucharest Metropolitan Region and focuses on systemic vulnerabilities of the city and emergency response. The fourth application case study is the Megacity of Istanbul which is prone to earthquake hazard chains, such as liquefaction, landslides, and tsunami, as well as to hydrometeorological hazards (extreme temperatures, fires, and flooding). Population growth rates, urban expansion speed, composition, and integration of new migrants (native, foreign, and refugees from countries like Syria and Afghanistan) contribute to the increasing disaster risk.&amp;#160;The project results will be hosted on two stakeholder hubs related to crisis management and humanitarian relief, and provide stakeholders with a set of tools for risk reduction planning in dynamic multi-hazard environments. The service-oriented approach with active stakeholder involvement will maximize the uptake and impact of the project, and help to increase Europe&amp;#8217;s resilience to compounding disasters.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu23-5815,"",,
rayyan-210775417,"Modeling Land Use/Land Cover Changes Using Quad Hybrid Machine Learning Model in Bangweulu Wetland and Surrounding Areas, Zambia",,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Wetlands are among the most productive natural ecosystems globally, providing crucial ecosystem services to people. Regrettably, a substantial 64–71% of wetlands have been lost worldwide since 1900, mainly due to changes in land use and land cover (LULC). This issue is not unique to Zambia's Bangweulu Wetland, which faces similar challenges. However, there is limited information about the LULC changes in Bangweulu Wetland. Furthermore, finding accurate and cost-effective methods to understand LULC dynamics is complicated by the multitude of available techniques for LULC classification. Non-parametric methods like Machine Learning (ML) offer greater accuracy, but different ML models come with distinct strengths and weaknesses. Combining multiple models has the potential to create a more precise LULC classification model. Open-source software like QGIS and spatial data like Landsat also play a significant role in this endeavour. The primary objective of this study was to enhance the accuracy of modeling LULC changes in wetland areas. A Quad hybrid model, which combined the best selected models: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naive Bayes (NB), Decision Tree (DT) and K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN), was used for LULC classification using Landsat 8 (2020 image) and Landsat 5 (1990, 2000, and 2010 images) in QGIS. Results revealed that the fusion of classified maps of the SVM, NB, DT, and KNN (Quad hybrid model) showcased superior performance compared to the individual models with Kappa Index scores of 0.87, 0.72, 0.84 and 0.87 for the years 1990, 2000, 2010 and 2020, respectively. The analysis of the LULC changes from 1990 to 2020 showed a yearly decline of -1.17%, -1.01%, and -0.12% in forest, grassland, and water body coverage, respectively. In contrast, built-up areas and cropland increased at rates of 1.70% and 2.70%, respectively. This study underscores the consistent growth of cropland and built-up areas from 1990 to 2020, alongside the reduction of forest cover and grassland. Although the water body experienced a gradual decrease over this period, the decline was minimal. Long-term monitoring will be essential for evaluating the success of interventions, guiding conservation efforts, mitigating negative impacts on the wetland ecosystem, and determining whether the reduction in water is a sustained trend or a short-term phenomenon.","",https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4626990,"",,
rayyan-210775599,Image-based Assessment of Vegetation Cover and Composition using U-Net-based Semantic Segmentation,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"<sc>Abstract.</sc> The vegetation cover and composition assessment is critical to understanding ecosystem health and biodiversity conservation. In the recent past, several factors such as rapid urbanization, soil degradation, and climate change have led to significant alterations in vegetation cover and composition, and have compromised Earth‘s natural ecosystem. Effective vegetation cover and composition management are quintessential to the sustainable growth of our planet. The field of vegetation cover and composition assessment is expanding as it realizes the essentiality of conserving biodiversity, effective land use planning, and optimum resource management strategies at our disposal. The recent advancements in deep learning and remote sensing technologies enable the collection of spatial information from the Earth‘s surface and the extraction of useful insights for informed decision-making that could benefit the environment. The aim of this research was to develop advanced semantic segmentation-based deep learning models using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that can effectively identify and differentiate multiple vegetation species, and accurately predict the area under vegetation cover. To achieve this target a dataset curation was done which comprised 10 diverse vegetation species especially âgrasses‘. The deep learning model of UNet was trained using different architecture backbones to generate composition assessment amongst different grass species. Also, trained predictive models were also used to evaluate the area under vegetation cover as well. The best-performing model was able to achieve an R<sup>2</sup> value of 0.84 in predicting the vegetation cover and a mean IOU score of 0.54 during testing. This study demonstrates a potential to use remote sensing data to generate vegetation cover and composition assessment for farming, urban planning, and construction applications.","",https://doi.org/10.13031/aim.202300237,"",,
rayyan-210775710,Deep-learning Coupled with Novel Classification Method to Classify the Urban Environment of the Developing World,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Rapid globalization and the interdependence of the countries have engendered tremendous in-flow of human migration towards the urban spaces. With the advent of high definition satellite images, high-resolution data, computational methods such as deep neural network analysis, and hardware capable of high-speed analysis; urban planning is seeing a paradigm shift. Legacy data on urban environments are now being complemented with high-volume, high-frequency data. However, the first step of understanding the urban area lies in the useful classification of the urban environment that is usable for data collection, analysis, and visualization. In this paper, we propose a novel classification method that is readily usable for machine analysis and it shows the applicability of the methodology in a developing world setting. However, the state-of-the-art is mostly dominated by the classification of building structures, building types, etc., and largely represents the developed world. Hence, these methods and models are not sufficient for developing countries such as Bangladesh where the surrounding environment is crucial for the classification. Moreover, the traditional classifications propose small-scale classifications, which give limited information, have poor scalability and are slow to compute in real-time. We categorize the urban area in terms of informal and formal spaces and take the surrounding environment into account. 50 km × 50 km Google Earth image of Dhaka, Bangladesh was visually annotated and categorized by an expert and consequently, a map was drawn. The classification is based broadly on two dimensions the state of urbanization and the architectural form of the urban environment. Consequently, the urban space is divided into four classifications: 1) highly informal area 2) moderately informal area 3) moderately formal area and 4) highly formal area. For semantic segmentation and automatic classification, Google’s DeeplabV3+ model was used. The model uses the Atrous convolution operation to analyze different layers of texture and shape. This allows us to enlarge the field of view of the filters to incorporate a larger context. Image encompassing 70% of the urban space was used to train the model and the remaining 30% was used for testing and validation. The model can segment with 75% accuracy and 60% Mean Intersection over Union (mIoU).","",https://doi.org/10.5121/csit.2021.110103,"",,
rayyan-210775785,Geo Visualization of Urbanization in CRDA Region through Machine Learning and Deep Learning Techniques,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Urbanization is the long-term problem associated with the growth in urban population due to migration, resulting in social inequalities and loss of natural resources, causing ecological imbalances across developed as well as developing countries. The environmental quality of the cities are affected by the uncontrolled usage of natural resources, the sprawl of settlements, unplanned development and large-scale industrial activities. The urban forms pose the primary challenges to humanity by rapidly depleting natural resources, enhancing climate change, global, regional, and local conflicts resulting in ineffective governance. It's essential to account for the driving forces contributing to urban growth and their effects on the city's environment, which aid in sustainability. The present research has assessed the land use change in the CRDA region through machine learning and deep learning approaches. The detailed digital infrastructure portrays the capabilities of sensing, controlling, and analyzing current and likely urban growth forms aids as a foundation for smart planning and sustainable development. The deep learning model shows a greater increase in built-up cover of 13% compared to 10% in the year 2022. The research findings provide valuable insights into urban growth, which aids the decision-makers in determining sustainable developmental measures and effective regional planning.","",https://doi.org/10.1109/conecct57959.2023.10234786,"",,

A large-scale cohort design used satellite imaging to quantify green space and clinical examinations and questionnaires to document myopia. We conducted this study in Shenzhen, the largest immigrant city in China, which is undergoing rapid urbanization. This study was based on data collected by the Environmental Health and Myopia Prevention and Control Project, which focused on evaluating the impact of environmental factors on the development of myopia (National Clinical Trial identifier, 04161326). A total of 113 schools in Shenzhen participated in the study. We included schoolchildren from grade 1 (6 years of age) to grade 4 (9 years of age), representing a period of rapid refractive error changes. This study was approved by the ethics committees of the Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center. Written informed consent obtained from all guardians was in accordance with the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki. Eye refraction data were collected annually from 2016 through 2019. Students were excluded from this study if they reported a history of wearing rigid contact lenses or if they had a history of medical treatment or a disease that might affect their vision or vision development, such as amblyopia or diabetes. Myopia was defined as spherical equivalent refraction (SER, sphere plus one-half cylinder) of at least –0.5 diopters (D). The increase in myopia prevalence was defined as the cumulative increase in myopia prevalence in each school from baseline (2016–2017) to the last data collection period (2018–2019), which is a continuous variable. Data from the right eyes were used for the analyses. The normalized difference vegetation index is used as the measure of green space exposure (Fig S1, available at www.aaojournal.org). The normalized difference vegetation index was defined as the ratio of the difference between near-infrared reflectance and red visible reflectance to their sum, which ranges between –1 and 1, with higher numbers indicating more greenness. A total of 159 895 students (grades 1 through 4) were eligible for the study (Fig S2, available at www.aaojournal.org). Students who had unreliable data or missing data were excluded further from the analyses. Of the 142 865 students (89.3%), boys constituted 56.4% of the total sample, with the proportion of children at each age ranging from 26.6% for 6-year-old children to 22.4% for 9-year-old children. A total of 17 646 students (12.4%) had myopia with an average SER of –1.636 diopters (D) at baseline. The total of 113 schools had an average myopia prevalence of 11.9% (standard deviation, 3.6%). School socioeconomic ranking information (key schools, moderate schools, and normal schools) was used to reflect the school socioeconomic status. The study included 24 key schools (21.2%), 52 moderate schools (46.0%), and 37 normal schools (32.7%) at baseline. The mean normalized difference vegetation index value for all schools was 0.202 (standard deviation, 0.057). At baseline, no association with green space exposure was observed for any of the other covariates that were assessed at school level (male percentage: r = 0.007, P = 0.427; average age: r = 0.124, P = 0.189; average SER: r = –0.180, P = 0.057; myopia prevalence: r = 0.117, P = 0.217; school socioeconomic status: r = –0.177, P = 0.061), for myopia (odds ratio, 1.063; 95% CI, 0.944–1.196; P = 0.313), and for SER of students at the individual level (β coefficient, –0.025; 95% CI, –0.083 to 0.034; P = 0.412). Of the students included in the baseline analyses, 118 369 (82.9%) participated in the final data collection. We analyzed the association between green space exposure and school- and individual-level outcomes. At the school level, a 0.1 increase in green space exposure was associated with a 3.6% lower (95% CI, 1.8%–5.5%; P = 0.0001; Fig 1; Table S1, available at www.aaojournal.org) increase in the school myopia prevalence over 2 years, adjusting for 4 covariates at baseline: average age, male percentage (percent of boys in a school), myopia prevalence at baseline, and school socioeconomic status. According to individual-specific refraction at baseline, the students were divided into nonmyopic and myopic groups. In the nonmyopic group, the model showed that a 0.1 increase in green space exposure was associated with a 19.8% (adjusted odds ratio, 0.802; 95% CI, 0.724–0.889; P < 0.0001; Table S1) reduction in the myopia risk. In the myopic group, the model showed that green space exposure was not associated with myopia progression (P = 0.058; Table S1). The student-level analyses were adjusted for 4 covariates: age, SER at baseline, sex, and school socioeconomic status. To estimate further potential effects caused by other possible confounding factors, a random sample of 8400 students was selected and a total of 7996 students' parents (95.2%) completed the questionnaires. Based on the subset, student-level analyses were adjusted for 5 additional covariates: paternal myopia, maternal myopia, average screen time per day, average reading time per day, and average outdoor activity time per day after school. Adding the covariates addressed in the questionnaire in terms of myopia incidence, a 0.1 increase in green space exposure was associated with a 27.9% (adjusted odds ratio, 0.821; 95% CI, 0.737–0.805; P < 0.0001; Table S1) reduction in the myopia risk in nonmyopic students. Regarding myopia progression, green space exposure was not associated significantly with myopia progression over 2 years in myopic students (P = 0.133; Table S1). Our study showed a negative association between green space exposure and myopia, providing a potential basis for the development of prevention strategies targeting the onset of myopia. No interactions or correlations were found between green space exposure and other known risk factors. Therefore, assuming a causal association between more green space in school and reduced myopia prevalence and that all the students respond in the same way to risk factors for myopia, if the green spaces of all schools were increased to 0.3 or more, the overall myopia prevalence would be reduced by approximately 4 percentage points per year. This would be sufficient to achieve the ideal myopia prevalence reduction suggested by the Ministry of Education in China (Fig 1).6Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of ChinaImplementation Plan for Comprehensive Prevention and Control of Myopia in Children and Adolescents.http://www.moe.gov.cn/srcsite/A17/moe_943/s3285/201808/t20180830_346672.htmlDate: 2018Date accessed: August 30, 2018Google Scholar Additionally, our study demonstrated that satellite imaging can mitigate the challenge of quantifying the environmental exposures at a macroscopic level by elucidating medical patterns using remotely sensed data.4Beck L.R.

Our study has several limitations. First, we did not consider the students' green space exposure outside their schools; therefore, we cannot exclude the impact of exposure to green space during the students' after-school time on myopia development. Second, the students in our study underwent refractive error measurement by noncycloplegic autorefraction instead of cycloplegic refractometry, which can lead to the overestimation of myopia. Third, despite the design of our study, our risk estimates indicate only correlations. Randomized controlled trials are still needed to investigate the effect of increasing green space as a community intervention for myopia. In summary, our study proved a strong association between green space and myopia in schoolchildren based on satellite imaging techniques. The implications are relevant to policymakers because greater access to green space potentially provides eye health benefits, which may help to contain the exploding epidemic of myopia in an increasing number of countries worldwide.

Understanding the complex relationship between land transformations and temperature changes is crucial for effective decision-making in the face of climate change. This study uses a data-driven approach to assess the effect of urban expansion and deforestation on temperature rise in Cajazeiras, Brazil. By integrating statistical modeling and machine learning techniques, we investigate the influence of urban areas and other factors on temperature trends. The statistical model (ARIMA) reveals a strong association between urbanization and temperature increase, emphasizing the need to address urban development and land use changes to mitigate rising temperatures. The SHAP values technique applied to a Random Forest model also uncovers additional drivers of temperature rise beyond urban expansion, such as the absence of savanna formation near the city. This comprehensive analysis provides valuable insights for policymakers and urban planners in mitigating the impact of climate change.","",https://doi.org/10.1109/la-cci58595.2023.10409431,"",,
rayyan-210776036,Towards a satellite based long-term monitoring and prediction of urban heat stress,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Climate change is causing temperatures around the globe to rise, leading to an increase in hot days and nights and a rise in the frequency and intensity of heat waves. High temperatures represent one of the key factors causing heat stress, which is affecting human health. Examples include the mega heat wave in August 2003 that took more than 70,000 lives across Europe or the unprecedented heat in 2018 with more than 100,000 heat-related deaths in the EU. Spatial exposure to heat stress varies, with urban areas usually heating up much stronger than their rural surroundings (urban heat island effect). With progressing global warming, the importance of spatially monitoring and predicting urban heat stress over large areas to prevent heat-associated morbidity and mortality is thus rising. For this purpose, thermal data obtained by satellites may represent a valuable alternative or addition to in-situ observations and climate modelling, which both show several advantages, but also shortcomings in terms of spatial coverage (in-situ), data needs (climate modelling) and costs.One of the main challenges for the use of satellite thermal data for urban heat stress monitoring is to convert the obtained land surface temperature (LST) into air temperature (AT), since satellites only provide information on the former whereas the latter is needed as input for most heat stress indicators. In our presentation, we will address this challenge with emphasis on urban regions. Two main strands of methods are used in the literature for converting LST into AT. First, data driven methods that use the empirical relationship between in-situ observations of AT from weather stations and LST data from satellites. These methods usually work well for individual stations, but the transferability of the relationship to different locations is typically limited. In addition, especially for methods based on machine learning techniques, a significant amount of data is needed for model calibration. The second type of methods comprises physical models. They typically make use of the energy balance to estimate AT from LST. These models show the advantage of better transferability but need additional input data besides LST. Moreover, physical methods are often designed for applications in rural areas, which may differ from the situation in cities. We apply different methods to derive AT from LST in urban regions and discuss their suitability to monitor and predict urban heat stress based on satellite thermal data.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu23-6962,"",,

rayyan-210776236,Disaster susceptibility analysis in remote sensing,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Natural disasters such as floods, landslides, and forest fires have caused infrastructure destruction, damage to property, injuries, and casualties worldwide. With the advent of sensing technology and data science methodologies, the impact of a disaster can be lessened through in-depth retrospective analysis. Of these, a priori hazard susceptibility analysis, which includes spatial analysis using remotely sensed images of the terrain, is widely adopted. Susceptibility analysis is thus related to spatial aspects of hazard analysis using data captured using both active and passive sensing. In the case of certain disasters, temporal information plays the role of causality owing to which spatiotemporal aspects are relevant. Historical data of occurrences play a vital role in determining the likelihood of disaster occurrence in a new area, or recurrences in an affected site. Such hazard mapping also helps in predicting the degree of the aftermath of a hazardous process in those areas. Overall, state-of-the-art susceptibility analysis uses remote sensing images, land survey data, and other related geospatial and non-spatial data in performing data preprocessing and analysis to calculate the probability of forthcoming hazard events. Data preprocessing involves noise removal, the transformation of raw data to the desired data structure or computed values, dimensionality reduction, feature ranking, and so on. Data analysis includes statistical, machine learning, and deep learning approaches. In this chapter, the widely used preprocessing and data analysis techniques applied in disaster susceptibility analysis are discussed. Additionally, disaster susceptibility analysis-related case studies, e.g. flood and landslide, are presented to elaborate the data science workflows. The resultant maps of the disaster susceptibility analysis are intended to be used by land developers, urban planners, and related authorities in innovating the land use planning and smarter disaster management.","",https://doi.org/10.1049/pbce135e_ch16,"",,

Urbanization has led to an increase in impervious surfaces, which alters hydrological flow pattern and delivers non-point pollutants to the stream more efficiently. In addition, intensification of agricultural activities can result in the increased nutrient loads due to alternations in surface soil properties. Hence, it is necessary to understand the impact of surrounding environment with specific emphasis on geographical factors (e.g. climate change, land use patterns and landscape metrics) on the RWQ in order to develop sustainable water quality management strategies effectively. We collected pollutant concentration Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD), Total Phosphorus (T-P), and&amp;#160; Total Organic Carbon(TOC) from monitoring stations in the Nakdong River watershed. To utilize field monitoring data, we developed a Machine Learning (ML) models (DNN, XGBoost and Random Forest) to predict RWQ in accordance with different environmental factors.

The study was conducted in Dehradun, Haridwar and Pauri Garhwal Districts of Uttarakhand State, India. In order to understand dynamics of landscape and to examine changes in the land use/cover due to anthropogenic activities, two satellite images (Landsat 5 and Landsat 8) for 1998 and 2020 were used. Google Earth Engine was used to perform supervised classification. Spectral indices (NDVI, MNDWI, SAVI, NDBI) were calculated in order to identify land cover classes. Both 1998 and 2020 satellite images were classified broadly into six classes namely agriculture, built-up, dense forest, open forest, scrub and waterbody. Using high resolution google earth satellite images and visual interpretation, overall accuracy assessment was performed. For land cover/use change analysis, these images were imported to GIS platform. Landscape configuration was observed by calculating various landscape metrices Images. It was observed that scrub land area had increased from 11 % to 14 % but a decrease in agriculture by 4.65 %. The increased value of NP, PD, PLAND, LPI and decrease in AI landscape indices shows that land fragmentation had increased since 1998. The most fragmented classes were scrub (PD - 3.32 to 5.18) and open forest (PD - 3.57 to 5.07). Decrease in AI for open forest, agriculture, built-up indicated that more fragmented patches of these classes were present.

Land use change is the process of how human activities alter the natural environment, which refers to how the land has been utilised, emphasising its functional role in economic activity. Urbanisation and urban growth are major issues in land use change that are usually accompanied by poor planning. The rapid increase in the urban population becomes one of the main confrontations in developing cities that accelerates the pace of change in LULC. Thus, increasing socioeconomic demands continue to increase pressure on LULC. The prediction models for LULC can be categorised into three groups: GIS-based models, machine learning models, and hybrid models. GIS-based models have encoded the datasets to produce spatial layers for predictor variables created from a series of LULC maps. Understanding the relationship between LULC change and its driving forces is critical in land use planning and management, as is being able to reasonably estimate future land demand.","",https://doi.org/10.1201/9781003270928-24,"",,

While previous research has identified that the composition of urban landscapes influences the physical properties of the environment such as surface temperature, a generalizable and flexible framework is needed that can be used to compare cities across time and space. This study employs the Structure of Urban Landscapes (STURLA) classification combined with remote sensing of New York City&amp;rsquo;s (NYC) surface temperature. These are then linked using machine learning and statistical modeling to identify how greenspace and the built environment influence urban surface temperature. It was observed that areas with urban units composed of largely the built environment hosted the hottest temperatures while those with vegetation and water were coolest. Likewise, this is reinforced by borough-level spatial differences in both urban structure and heat. Comparison of these relationships over the period between2008 and 2017 identified changes in surface temperature that are likely due to the changes in prevalence in water, lowrise buildings, and pavement across the city. This research reinforces how human alteration of the environment changes ecosystem function and offers units of analysis that can be used for research and urban planning.","",https://doi.org/10.20944/preprints202105.0199.v1,"",,

Due to this dependency, future recreational opportunities provided by nature are at risk from climate change. To understand how climate change will impact recreation we need to understand current recreational patterns, but traditional data is limited and low resolution. Fortunately, social media data presents an opportunity to overcome those data limitations and machine learning offers a tool to effectively use that big data. We use data from the social media site Flickr as a proxy for recreational visitation and random forest to model the relationships between social, environmental, and climate factors and recreation for the peak season (summer) in California. We then use the model to project how non-urban recreation will change as the climate changes. Our model shows that current patterns are exacerbated in the future under climate change, with currently popular summer recreation areas becoming more suitable and unpopular summer recreation areas becoming less suitable for recreation. Our model results have land management implications as recreation regions that see high visitation consequently experience impacts to surrounding ecosystems, ecosystem services, and infrastructure. This information can be used to include climate change impacts into land management plans to more effectively provide sustainable nature recreation opportunities for current and future generations. Furthermore, our study demonstrates that crowdsourced data and machine learning offer opportunities to better integrate socio-ecological systems into climate impacts research and more holistically understand climate change impacts to human well-being.","",https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/ac65a3,"",,

Effective urban forestry management is essential for enhancing ES, but challenging to develop in densely populated cities where tradeoffs between high ES provision and issues of periodic disaster-caused risks or maintenance costs must be balanced. With the aim of providing practical guidelines to promote green cities, this study developed an AI-based analytical approach to systematically evaluate tree conditions and detect management problems. By using a self-organizing map technique with a big dataset of Taipei street trees, we integrated the ES values estimated by i-Tree Eco to tree attributes of DBH, height, leaf area, and leaf area index (LAI) to comprehensively assess their complex relationship and interlinkage. We found that DBH and leaf area are good indicators for the provision of ES, allowing us to quantify the potential loss and tradeoffs by cross-checking with tree height and the correspondent ES values. In contrast, LAI is less effective in estimating ES than DBH and leaf area, but is useful as a supplementary one. We developed a detailed lookup table by compiling the tree datasets to assist the practitioners with a rapid assessment of tree conditions and associated loss of ES values. This analytical approach provides accessible, science-based information to appraise the right species, criteria, and place for landscape design. It gives explicit references and guidelines to help detect problems and guide directions for improving the ES and the sustainability of urban forests.","",https://doi.org/10.3389/fenvs.2022.994389,"",,

LULC changes have impacts on many levels, e.g., climate change, biodiversity and ecosystem services, soil quality, which, in turn, have implications for the landscape. Therefore, it is fundamental that planning is informed by scientific evidence. The objective of this work was to develop a geographic model to identify the main patterns of LULC transitions between the years 2000 and 2018, to simulate a baseline scenario for the year 2036, and to assess the effectiveness of the Chapecó River ecological corridor (an area created by State Decree No. 2.957/2010), regarding the recovery and conservation of forest remnants and natural fields. The results indicate that the forest remnants have tended to recover their area, systematically replacing silviculture areas. However, natural fields (grassland) are expected to disappear in the near future if proper measures are not taken to protect this ecosystem. If the current agricultural advance pattern is maintained, only 0.5% of natural fields will remain in the ecological corridor by 2036.

Ten different regional climate models with a target resolution of 10 km and two emission scenarios were considered, namely the moderate (RCP4.5) and business-as-usual (RCP8.5) scenarios. The study covers the interval from 2021 to 2100. In order to predict the future snow depth, snow cover duration and snowfall amounts based on the available parameters from the RCM simulations, it was necessary to identify the complex relationship between snowfall, snow melting, temperature and precipitation. In order to do this, we first extracted the ERA5 reanalysis data from 1981 to 2020 for each urban area, and then employed a Bayesian Regularized Neural Network (BRNN). The resulting model was used to predict the future variables for all major urban areas in Romania.A general trend of decreasing snowfall amounts, mean snow depth and snow cover duration was observed for all analyzed areas and for both emission scenarios. Important regional variations were also observed, with some areas no significant change for the 2021 &amp;#8211; 2050 interval compared to the observation period, which could be explained mostly by the increasing winter precipitation predicted by the RCM simulation. The results also showed an increased possibility of some years virtually lacking any snow cover and snowfall precipitation, especially after 2050 in the business-as-usual scenario (RCP8.5). However, an increased variability was also observed, with extreme snowfall events remaining possible even in the latter half of the study interval.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu23-12497,"",,

UASs are often equipped with high spatial resolution cameras and/or light detection and ranging (LiDAR). However, the high spatial resolution imagery has a high information content, which makes land cover classification quite challenging. Recently, deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) have been effectively applied to remote sensing applications, which overcome the drawback of traditional techniques. In this research, a low-cost UAV-based multi-sensor data fusion model was developed for land cover classification based on a DCNN. For the purpose of this research, two datasets were collected at two different urban locations using two different UASs. A DCNN model, based on U-net with Resnet101 as a backbone, was used to train and test the fused image/LiDAR data. The maximum likelihood and support vector machine techniques were used as a reference for classifier comparison. It was shown that the proposed DCNN approach improved the overall accuracy of land cover classification for the first dataset by 15% compared to the reference classifiers. In addition, the overall accuracy of land cover classification improved by 7%, and the precision, recall, and F-measure improved by 18% when the fused image/LiDAR data were used compared to the images only.

In this study, we proposed a machine learning (ML) method that uses convolutional neural networks (CNN) and target sound area ratios (TSAR) to quantify the dominance of seven types of acoustic scenes. Acoustic data was recorded at nine sites in three urban forests in Guangzhou, China.

Data-driven artificial intelligence is becoming so fundamentally ingrained in these developments that smart cities have been called artificially intelligent cities and autonomous cities. The COVID-19 pandemic has increased the physical isolation of people and consequently escalated the pace of human migration to digital and virtual spaces. This paper investigates the use of AI in urban governance as to how AI could help governments learn about urban governance parameters on various subject matters for the governments to develop better governance instruments. To this end, we develop a case study on online learning in Saudi Arabia. We discover ten urban governance parameters using unsupervised machine learning and Twitter data in Arabic. We group these ten governance parameters into four governance macro-parameters namely Strategies and Success Factors, Economic Sustainability, Accountability, and Challenges. The case study shows that the use of data-driven AI can help the government autonomously learn about public feedback and reactions on government matters, the success or failure of government programs, the challenges people are facing in adapting to the government measures, new economic, social, and other opportunities arising out of the situation, and more. The study shows that the use of AI does not have to necessarily replace humans in urban governance, rather governments can use AI, under human supervision, to monitor, learn and improve decision-making processes using continuous feedback from the public and other stakeholders.

Taking the urban areas of Wuhan, a typical rapid urbanizing region in China, as the study area, this study built a Markov chain-artificial neural network (ANN)-cellular automaton (CA) coupled model. The model used land use classification spatial data with a spatial resolution of 5 m in 2010 and 2020, obtained by remote sensing image interpretation, and data on natural and socio-economic driving forces for land use change simulation. Using the coupled model, the land use patterns of Wuhan urban areas in 2020 were simulated, which were validated in comparison with the actual land use data in 2020. Finally, the model was used to simulate the land uses in the study area in 2030. The model validation indicates that the land use change simulation has a high accuracy of 90.7% and a high kappa coefficient of 0.87. The simulated land uses of the urban areas of Wuhan show that artificial surfaces will continue to expand, with an area increase of approximately 7% from 2020 to 2030.

This issue is not unique to Zambia's Bangweulu Wetland, which faces similar challenges. However, there is limited information about the LULC changes in Bangweulu Wetland. Furthermore, finding accurate and cost-effective methods to understand LULC dynamics is complicated by the multitude of available techniques for LULC classification. Non-parametric methods like Machine Learning (ML) offer greater accuracy, but different ML models come with distinct strengths and weaknesses. Combining multiple models has the potential to create a more precise LULC classification model. Open-source software like QGIS and spatial data like Landsat also play a significant role in this endeavour. The primary objective of this study was to enhance the accuracy of modeling LULC changes in wetland areas. A Quad hybrid model, which combined the best selected models: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naive Bayes (NB), Decision Tree (DT) and K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN), was used for LULC classification using Landsat 8 (2020 image) and Landsat 5 (1990, 2000, and 2010 images) in QGIS. Results revealed that the fusion of classified maps of the SVM, NB, DT, and KNN (Quad hybrid model) showcased superior performance compared to the individual models with Kappa Index scores of 0.87, 0.72, 0.84 and 0.87 for the years 1990, 2000, 2010 and 2020, respectively. The analysis of the LULC changes from 1990 to 2020 showed a yearly decline of -1.17%, -1.01%, and -0.12% in forest, grassland, and water body coverage, respectively. In contrast, built-up areas and cropland increased at rates of 1.70% and 2.70%, respectively. This study underscores the consistent growth of cropland and built-up areas from 1990 to 2020, alongside the reduction of forest cover and grassland. Although the water body experienced a gradual decrease over this period, the decline was minimal. Long-term monitoring will be essential for evaluating the success of interventions, guiding conservation efforts, mitigating negative impacts on the wetland ecosystem, and determining whether the reduction in water is a sustained trend or a short-term phenomenon.","",https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4626993,"",,
rayyan-210777288,The Impact of Climate Change on Urban Transportation Resilience to Compound Extreme Events,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Global warming, sea-level rise, and rapid urbanization all increase the risk of compound extreme weather events, presenting challenges for the operation of urban-related infrastructure, including transportation infrastructure. In this context, some questions become important. For example, what are the temporal and spatial distribution and development trends of transportation resilience when considering the impact of multilpe extreme weather events on the urban transportation system? What is the degree of loss of urban transportation resilience (UT resilience) under different extreme event intensities, and how long will it take for the entire system to restore balance? In the future, if extreme weather events become more frequent and intense, what trends will urban transportation resilience show? Considering these problems, the current monitoring methods for transportation resilience under the influence of extreme events are lacking, especially the monitoring of the temporal and spatial dynamic changes of transportation resilience under the influence of compined extreme events. The development of big data mining technology and deep learning methods for spatiotemporal predictions made the construction of spatiotemporal data sets for evaluating and predicting UT resilience-intensity indicators possible. Such data sets reveal the temporal and spatial features and evolution of UT resilience intensity under the influence of compound extreme weather events, as well as the related future change trends. They indicate the key research areas that should be focused on, namely, the transportation resilience under climate warming. This work is especially important in planning efforts to adapt to climate change and rising sea levels and is relevant to policymakers, traffic managers, civil protection managers, and the general public.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/su14073880,"",,
rayyan-210777296,"Identifying Urban Wetlands through Remote Sensing Scene Classification Using Deep Learning: A Case Study of Shenzhen, China",,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Urban wetlands provide cities with unique and valuable ecosystem services but are under great degradation pressure. Correctly identifying urban wetlands from remote sensing images is fundamental for developing appropriate management and protection plans. To overcome the semantic limitations of traditional pixel-level urban wetland classification techniques, we proposed an urban wetland identification framework based on an advanced scene-level classification scheme. First, the Sentinel-2 high-resolution multispectral image of Shenzhen was segmented into 320 m × 320 m square patches to generate sample datasets for classification. Next, twelve typical convolutional neural network (CNN) models were transformed for the comparison experiments. Finally, the model with the best performance was used to classify the wetland scenes in Shenzhen, and pattern and composition analyses were also implemented in the classification results. We found that the DenseNet121 model performed best in classifying urban wetland scenes, with overall accuracy (OA) and kappa values reaching 0.89 and 0.86, respectively. The analysis results revealed that the wetland scene in Shenzhen is generally balanced in the east–west direction. Among the wetland scenes, coastal open waters accounted for a relatively high proportion and showed an obvious southward pattern. The remaining swamp, marsh, tidal flat, and pond areas were scattered, accounting for only 4.64% of the total area of Shenzhen. For scattered and dynamic urban wetlands, we are the first to achieve scene-level classification with satisfactory results, thus providing a clearer and easier-to-understand reference for management and protection, which is of great significance for promoting harmony between humanity and ecosystems in cities.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/ijgi11020131,"",,

This is why LULC Change Analysis plays an important role in planning and using current and future natural resources for the sustainable development of any country. This paper performs LULC classification and analysis over a study region in Ganjam District, Odisha, India. Satellite data was extracted from Landsat 7 and 8 satellites that provide spectral and multi-temporal images. For the LULC classification, 5 LULC classes were considered such as water bodies, vegetation, urban areas, barren Land, and cropland. A machine learning-based approach was applied using Google Earth Engine (GEE) to compare different supervised classifiers such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Classification and Regression Trees (CART), and Random Forest over the periods between 2010 and 2020. In this study, SVM gave the best results with 92 percent Overall Accuracy(OA) and 0.90 Kappa Value. Also, the change analysis showed that Urban areas increased by 112 percent, cropland by 9 percent, and barren land decreased by 68 percent between 2010 and 2020.","",https://doi.org/10.1109/ictbig59752.2023.10456228,"",,

The 32,000-ha Metropolitan Forest aims to improve the quality of life in the city. It is divided into five zones. The 1,250- ha Zone Four project explores a design alternative to the area's dominant hardscaped plaza and high-maintenance nineteenth-century park from the notion of the artificial pastoral. It magnifies the water cycle in three new and recovered historical aspects: increased floodable areas, a network of natural and artificial green-blue infrastructures, and an increased volume of used regenerated water and sludge to support a palette of forested landscapes. The project also contributes to slow mobility, civic nodes and connectivity infrastructures between the city and the Metropolitan Forest. Historically, compact Mediterranean cities like Madrid have had an aversion to trees. Fortunately, recent initiatives by the city are changing course, allowing both urban forestry and forest urbanism to flourish.Keywords: ForestsMadridgreenbeltwater infrastructurewater cycle Notes1 Retrieved from the Metropolitan Forest website: bosquemetropolitano.madrid.es.2 The Directorate General for Strategic Planning (Direccion General de Planificacion Estrategica, DGPE) has taken on the task of launching the Metropolitan Forested Green Belt project in 2020.

rayyan-210777447,Observations and Forecasts of Urban Transportation Meteorology in China: A Review,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Against the backdrop of intensified global warming, extreme weather events such as dense fog, low visibility, heavy precipitation, and extreme temperatures have been increased and enhanced to a great extent. They are likely to pose severe threats to the operation of urban transportation and associated services, which has drawn much attention in recent decades. However, there are still plenty of issues to be resolved in improving the emergency meteorological services and developing targeted urban transportation meteorological services in modern cities. The present review briefly illustrates the current cutting-edge developments and trends in the field of urban transportation meteorology in China, including the establishment of observation networks and experiments and the development of early warning and prediction technologies, as well as the related meteorological commercial services. Meanwhile, reflections and discussions are provided in terms of the state-of-the-art observation channels and methods and the application of numerical model forecasts and artificial intelligence. With the advantages of various advanced technologies from multiple aspects, researchers could further expand explorations on urban transportation meteorological observations, forecasts, early warnings, and services. Associated theoretical studies and practical investigations are also to be carried out to provide solid scientific foundations for urban transportation disaster prevention and mitigation, for implementing the action of meteorological guarantees, and for the construction of a high-quality smart society.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/atmos13111823,"",,

For active disaster management combined approaches may be used such as applications of artificial intelligence, e.g. geographical analysis, risk mapping and tracking, obscure sensing ability, advance technologies for drone and machine learning and urban planning based on smart cities technology, analysis of hotspots and analysis of environmental impacts are modern technologies which needs to be studied more in the context of disaster management. Researchers of social sciences used different procedures and technology to analyze the hazards, risks and catastrophe between disciplinal.They utilized empirical and evaluative collection of data and itsanalysis techniques. The current study is an overview of present applications of AI being helpful in disaster management throughout its tetrahedral states. AI is important in all states of disaster management as it's a faster solution than other technologies. Integration of two basic supportive tools which are Remote Sensing (RS) and Geographically Information System (GIS) in disaster management provides higher level of planning and its analysis. It can help authorities to take quick and effective decisions in case of natural disaster.","",https://doi.org/10.32350/otr.0302.05,"",,
rayyan-210777805,Discretization of the Urban and Non-Urban Shape: Unsupervised Machine Learning Techniques for Territorial Planning,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"One of the goals of the scientific community is to equip the discipline of spatial planning with efficient tools to handle huge amounts of data. In this sense, unsupervised machine learning techniques (UMLT) can help overcome this obstacle to further the study of spatial dynamics. New machine-learning-based technologies make it possible to simulate the development of urban spatial dynamics and how they may interact with ecosystem services provided by nature. Modeling information derived from various land cover datasets, satellite earth observation and open resources such as Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) represent a key structural step for geospatial support for land use planning. Sustainability is certainly one of the paradigms on which planning and the study of past, present and future spatial dynamics must be based. Topics such as Urban Ecosystem Services have assumed such importance that they have become a prerogative on which to guide the administration in the difficult process of transformation, taking place not only in the urban context, but also in the peri-urban one. In this paper, we present an approach aimed at analyzing the performance of clustering methods to define a standardized system for spatial planning analysis and the study of associated dynamics. The methodology built ad hoc in this research was tested in the spatial context of the city of L’Aquila (Abruzzo, Italy) to identify the urbanized and non-urbanized area with a standardized and automatic method.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/app122010439,"",,
rayyan-210777848,Application of UAV remote sensing and machine learning to model and map land use in urban gardens,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract Urban gardens are an integral part of urban agricultural systems, contributing to ecosystem services, biodiversity and human wellbeing. These systems occur at fine scales, can be highly complex and therefore offer the opportunity to test mechanisms of ecological patterns and processes. The capacity to confidently characterize urban gardens and their land uses is still lacking, while it could provide the basis for assessing ecosystem service provision. Land classifications from remote sensing platforms are common at the landscape scale, but imagery often lacks the resolution required to map differences in land use of fine-scale systems such as urban gardens. Here, we present a workflow to model and map land use in urban gardens using imagery from an unoccupied aerial vehicle (UAV) and machine learning. Due to high resolutions (&amp;lt;5 cm) from image acquisition at low altitudes, UAV remote sensing is better suited to characterize urban land use. We mapped six common land uses in 10 urban community gardens, exhibiting distinct spatial arrangements. Our models had good predictive performance, reaching 80% overall prediction accuracy in independent validation and up to 95% when assessing model performance per cover class. Extracting spatial metrics from these land use classifications, we found that at the garden and plot scale, plant species richness can be estimated by the total area and patchiness of crops. Land use classifications like these can offer an accessible tool to assess complex urban habitats and justify the importance of urban agriculture as a service-providing system, contributing to the sustainability and livability of cities.","",https://doi.org/10.1093/jue/juac008,"",,
rayyan-210777878,Urban Management in Authoritarian China: How the Smart City is Used to Enhance Comprehensive Law Enforcement,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"ABSTRACT'Comprehensive law enforcement' is an important part of the Chinese Communist Party's (CCP's) thinking on urban management. It involves all government departments and units related to law enforcement working together to improve their administrative efficiency. Since 2009, the CCP has absorbed some elements of the Western concept of the 'smart city', including the use of big data analysis and technology in implementing and enforcing the law. At the heart of the Chinese smart city is the 'city brain'. For the CCP regime, the primary purpose of the smart city is to monitor society and improve the efficiency of urban management; making life more convenient for residents is a secondary consideration. In other words, this mechanism is strongly state led in nature, and it is aimed at ensuring the regime's survival by strengthening the CCP's capacity to govern. We found that due to incentives built into the cadre evaluation system, grassroots officials use the information gathered through smart city technology to achieve 'hard' law enforcement targets rather to improve people's lives.KEYWORDS: cadre evaluation systemcomprehensive law enforcementcity brainsmart cityurban management AcknowledgmentsWe thank the editor and reviewers for their suggestions.

The increased utilization of land resources due to population growth have led to loss of biodiversity and urban planning issues such as flooding and pollution. This study analysed the LULC changes within the Kpeshie lagoon Basin of the Greater Accra Region of Ghana and made prediction to the year 2030. Random Forest (RF) classifier was employed to classify the LULC within the study area using Landsat image for four different time-steps (1991, 2002, 2013 and 2020). LULC change analysis was performed for consecutive years (1991 – 2002, 2002 – 2013 and 2013 – 2020) and for the entire period (1991 – 2020). Subsequently, a prediction LULC was made to the year 2030 using a combination of artificial neural network (ANN) and cellular automata (CA) simulations. The LULC classification produced 92.68%, 84.35%, 84.41% and 89.93% overall accuracies and kappa statistics of 0.87, 0.87, 0.84 and 0.91 for the time-steps respectively. Over the study period, significant LULC changes were observed, as the Kpeshie Lagoon Basin which was predominantly covered by vegetation (69.33%) in 1991 had transformed into a major built-up area (50.50%) in 2020. The spatial prediction estimated built-up to cover 60.15% in 2030, followed by bare land, 32.39%, vegetation 6.97% and waterbody 0.49%. The study revealed that LULC within the Kpeshie Lagoon Basin has been hugely impacted due to urbanization and non-enforcement of regulations.","",https://doi.org/10.56049/jghie.v23i1.64,"",,

Southern Africa encompasses significant areas of dryland forests that are important to local communities but are facing rapid deforestation and are highly vulnerable to biome degradation from land uses and extreme climate events. Appropriate integration of remote sensing technologies helps to assess and monitor forest ecosystems and provide spatially explicit, operational, and long-term data to assist the sustainable use of tropical environment landscapes. The period from 2010 onwards has seen the rapid development of remote sensing research on tropical forests, which has led to a significant increase in the number of scientific publications. This review aims to analyse and synthesise the evidence published in peer review studies with a focus on optical and radar remote sensing of dryland forests in Southern Africa from 1997–2020. For this study, 137 citation indexed research publications have been analysed with respect to publication timing, study location, spatial and temporal scale of applied remote sensing data, satellite sensors or platforms employed, research topics considered, and overall outcomes of the studies. This enabled us to provide a comprehensive overview of past achievements, current efforts, major research topics studies, EO product gaps/challenges, and to propose ways in which challenges may be overcome. It is hoped that this review will motivate discussion and encourage uptake of new remote sensing tools (e.g., Google Earth Engine (GEE)), data (e.g., the Sentinel satellites), improved vegetation parameters (e.g., red-edge related indices, vegetation optical depth (VOD)) and methodologies (e.g., data fusion or deep learning, etc.), where these have potential applications in monitoring dryland forests.","",https://doi.org/10.1088/2515-7620/ac5b84,"",,

At present, there are few studies on the spatial–temporal evolution characteristics of land-use change in earthquake-stricken regions, especially the lack of quantitative evaluation of the impact of earthquakes on land use at the micro-scale. The “5·12” Wenchuan ms8.0 earthquake caused serious damage to the surface resources in the disaster area. The study on the spatial–temporal evolution characteristics of land-use change in the disaster area can provide a reference for the remote sensing dynamic monitoring of the ecological environment. Therefore, based on geographical big data, this paper used a land-use comprehensive degree index, land-use transfer matrix, and landscape ecological index to explore and analyze the spatial–temporal evolution characteristics of land use in Wenchuan County before and after the earthquake. The results showed that the types of cropland, forest, built-up, and bare land changed greatly before and after the earthquake. During the earthquake recovery period, the comprehensive index of land use in the study area basically showed an increasing trend. Under the effect of artificial measures and natural restoration, land use was continuously improved, and vegetation was restored well. After 2008, the Patch Density (PD) and Landscape Shape Index (LSI) values of most landscape types decreased, and the Aggregation Index (AI) values increased, indicating that the ecological environment of the whole region showed a benign development in the post-earthquake period. The results not only contribute to the establishment of scientific ecological environment management in earthquake-stricken regions but also contribute to the formulation of long-term ecological environment monitoring and ecological restoration planning according to the law of land-use change.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/su14159721,"",,

Land-use changes from 2000 to 2035 were simulated and projected under the current trend scenario (CTS), economic development scenario (EDS) and ecological protection scenario (EPS) in the Heihe River Basin, while the RSEI was predicted using the elastic net regression (machine learning method); finally, the predicted results were synthesized and analyzed. The results showed that forest, grassland and water were positively correlated with ecological quality, with the green space coverage under the CTS, EPS and EDS accounting for 34.15%, 70.65% and 34.72% of the total transferred land area, respectively. The increase in the area of build-up land and unutilized land was detrimental to ecological quality, with the area of building land in the EDS being 1.75 times larger than in the year 2000. The EDS contributes to the sustainable development of the upstream area and the EPS is more conducive to the midstream and downstream areas by limiting the expansion of build-up land and by developing unutilized land in a limited way to increase the area of green space after reconciling economic conditions. Projection results promote the rational allocation of various land-use types in the future (semi) arid region, such as artificial forestation, unutilized land development and restriction of urban expansion, and also lay the foundation for the formulation of policies such as water allocation and ecological protection to facilitate the sustainable development of regional society, economy and ecology.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/su14052716,"",,

rayyan-210778429,Extraction of Urban Built-Up Area Based on Deep Learning and Multi-Sources Data Fusion—The Application of an Emerging Technology in Urban Planning,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"With the rapid expansion of urban built-up areas in recent years, it has become particularly urgent to develop a fast, accurate and popularized urban built-up area extraction method system. As the direct carrier of urban regional relationship, urban built-up area is an important reference to judge the level of urban development. The accurate extraction of urban built-up area plays an important role in formulating scientific planning thus to promote the healthy development of both urban area and rural area. Although nighttime light (NTL) data are used to extract urban built-up areas in previous studies, there are certain shortcomings in using NTL data to extract urban built-up areas. On the other hand, point of interest (POI) data and population migration data represent different attributes in urban space, which can both assist in modifying the deficiencies of NTL data from both static and dynamic spatial elements, respectively, so as to improve the extraction accuracy of urban built-up areas. Therefore, this study attempts to propose a feasible method to modify NTL data by fusing Baidu migration (BM) data and POI data thus accurately extracting urban built-up areas in Guangzhou. More accurate urban built-up areas are extracted using the method of U-net deep learning network. The maximum built-up area extracted from the study is 1103.45 km2, accounting for 95.21% of the total built-up area, and the recall rate is 0.8905, the precision rate is 0.8121, and the F1 score is 0.8321. The results of using POI data and BM data to modify NTL data to extract built-up areas have not been significantly improved due to the fact that the more data get fused, the more noise there would be, which would ultimately affect the results. This study analyzes the feasibility and insufficiency of using big data to modify NTL data through data fusion and feature extraction system, which has important theoretical and practical significance for future studies on urban built-up areas and urban development.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/land11081212,"",,

Research on land-use-derived carbon storage and sequestration capability is crucial for emission reduction strategy and sustainable development. Because cities are becoming significant sources of carbon emissions, an accurate assessment of city-level carbon storage and sequestration is now required. This study intended to estimate the carbon storage and sequestration capabilities using the InVEST model under different land use land cover (LULC) classes in Abha, Saudi Arabia. We used a support vector machine (SVM) for LULC mapping. For the future forecasting of the LULC map, we employed cellular automata (ANN-CA). Expansion of built-up land is the primary source of CO 2 . From 1990 to 2040, agriculture lost 145 megagram of carbon per hectare (Mg C/ha), whereas vegetation lost 34,948.15 Mg C/ha. Vegetation would get 17,363.7 Mg C/ha during the same period, whereas urban areas would receive 3924.1 Mg C/ha. Approximately 17,000 Mg C/ha would be lost from the vegetation area in future periods. The approaches outlined in this paper may add a new dimension to carbon emission analyses and provide helpful information for low-carbon city.","",https://doi.org/10.3389/fevo.2022.905799,"",,
rayyan-210778472,Feeding the cities: Urban agriculture for food security and sustainability of urban areas,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract With the increasing migration of people to urban areas, the demand for extra, fresh, and healthy food in cities has escalated manyfold. Further, anthropogenic activities, high rise buildings, and unplanned construction in urban areas are increasing urban heat. Therefore, the objective of this study is to review the salient features and constraints of urban agriculture, in addition to illustrating traditional and modern approaches, and policies used worldwide to promote the urban agriculture (UA). Urban agriculture is a key component of sustainable urban development that plays a pivotal role in combating food security and malnutrition in peri-urban and urban areas by growing different fruits, vegetables, mushrooms, herbs, flowering and ornamental plants in urban dwellings for food and aesthetic purposes. UA often combines with other functions like urban greening, biodiversity, waste recycling, environmental disaster reduction, CO 2 absorption, urban heat island reduction, recreational benefits, contributing to the circular economy and UN sustainable development goals (SDGs). Plants in UA are grown in vacant open spaces, rooftops, balconies and containers, resulting in urban organic harvest by fostering income and health improvement. The concept of UA is being utilized efficiently in many countries. However, there is still a need to promote UA by arranging community gatherings and school students, creating awareness and capacity building through education and training. Growers need to be connected to land and open spaces, enhancing value addition in UA and formulating supportive policies to foster Agri-tourism in urban farms to making it a successful initiative. Recent innovative research ideas and new technological developments such as artificial intelligence (AI), internet of things (IoT), automation and mechanization in UA are opening new avenues for quality food production in urban areas for sustainable cities.","",https://doi.org/10.1079/cabireviews.2024.0053,"",,

One response to such changes has been to make cities ecologically sustainable and ‘smart’. From real-time bus information, autonomous electric vehicles, smart parking, and smart street lighting, such initiatives are often presented as a social and environmental good. Critics, however, increasingly argue that technologically driven, and efficiency-led approaches to sustainability in the smart city are too simplistic and leave little room for participation and citizen agency despite government efforts to integrate innovative technologies in more equitable ways. This has prompted a growing awareness that a human-centred notion of cities, in which urban space is designed for, and inhabited by, humans only, is no longer tenable. Within the age of the Anthropocene, increasing numbers of scholars and practitioners are acknowledging the entanglements between human and non-human others (including plants, animals, insects, as well as soil, water, and sensors and their data) in urban life. In Designing More-than-Human Smart Cities, renowned researchers and practitioners from urban planning, architecture, environmental humanities, geography, design, arts, and computing critically explore smart cities beyond a human-centred approach. They respond to the complex interrelations between human and non-human others in urban space. Through theory, policy, and practice (past and present), as well as thinking speculatively about how smart cities may evolve in the future, the book makes a timely contribution to lively, contemporary scientific and political debates on what it means to design genuinely sustainable smart cities.","",https://doi.org/10.1093/9780191980060.001.0001,"",,

The term “land use” relates to how humans are using the landscape, whether it is for expansion, conservation, or a combination of the two. Human activity on the Earth’s surface alters the land cover area. These adjustments greatly affect how well-functioning vital Earth system components (such as the balance of energy, soil, and water). Applications for remote sensing make it possible to analyses land changes quickly and affordably. Numerous researchers have created techniques for analyzing modifications in the LULC. This study used GIS and random forest machine learning technique to pinpoint the LULC changes in Muzaffarpur District’s urban and rural areas in the span of 15 years i.e., 2005 to 2020. The User land is scattered throughout the western region. The district’s soil becomes more salinized and alkaline as a result of the waterlogging that is also prevalent in some areas of the district. This study’s technique is simple and inexpensive. Between 2005 and 2020, there were major variations in the LULC in the research area. The rise in built-up activity is the main cause of the LULC alterations in the studied region. The current study may not be significantly impacted by the LULC changes. However, to maintain environmentally sustainable development in the future, LULC alteration needs to be continuously watched.","",https://doi.org/10.60151/envec/rodf5502,"",,

Non-risk-oriented LULCCs can act as disaster risk drivers by increasing levels of exposure and vulnerability or by reducing capacity. Making thematically detailed long-term LULCC data available is crucial to improving understanding of those dynamics interlinked at different spatiotemporal scales. For the Ayeyarwady Delta, one of the least studied mega-deltas, such comprehensive information is still lacking. This study used 50 Landsat and Sentinel-1A images spanning five decades from 1974 to 2021 in five-year intervals. A hybrid ensemble model consisting of six machine-learning classifiers was employed to generate land-cover maps from the images, achieving accuracies of about 90%. The major identified potential risk-relevant LULCC dynamics include urban growth towards low-lying areas, mangrove deforestation, and the expansion of irrigated agricultural areas and cultivated aquatic surfaces. The novel area-wide LULCC products achieved through the analyses provide a basis to support future risk-sensitive development decisions and can be used for regionally adapted disaster risk management plans and models.

Monitoring vegetation is essential for informed agriculture, resource management, ecological understanding, and environmental tracking. Remote sensing data offers valuable insights into plant life, benefiting biodiversity, agriculture, forestry, and urban green systems. In agriculture, this data provides an unbiased foundation for yield management and crop production prediction. Vegetation indices (VIs) are vital for assessing vegetation health, growth, and physiological conditions. They mitigate atmospheric interference and are widely used in agriculture to monitor plant health, estimate crop yields, and study vegetation dynamics, including chlorophyll content estimation. Current techniques such as handheld spectrometers and satellite imagery are effective but limited. Handheld spectrometers require time-consuming field measurements, restricting spatial coverage. Satellite methods face spatial resolution, cloud interference, cost, and real-time insight challenges. Recent advancements in computer vision, driven by machine learning, offer transformative potential. Computer vision can process real-time data from drone imagery and automated accurate VI measurements. This integration opens avenues for precision agriculture and environmental monitoring.

Utilizing big data, including mobile phone signals collected at high frequencies, alongside administrative data, is essential for developing risk exposure indicators in smaller urban regions. Accurately assessing human traffic flows and movements is crucial for mitigating the impacts of natural disasters and ensuring a high quality of life in smart cities. However, comprehensive solutions to these challenges are lacking in many countries. Therefore, this study focuses on analyzing the impact of traffic data flow analysis in hydrogeological risk areas. The study employs mobile phone signals as big data to analyze traffic flows and forecast exposure risks to aid decision-making. To ensure data reliability, a circle search integrated fully connected conditional neural network (CS-ConNN) is used for data cleaning, categorizing mobile phone signal data into normal, empty, and garbage. Additionally, the study uses a deep recurrent neuro fuzzy system (DRNFS) to analyze the compound seasonality of circulation flow data and forecast risks, providing alerts to individuals transiting through affected areas. The model is validated through a case study of ""Mandolossa,"" and developed area prone to inundating near Brescia, using hourly data from September 2020 to August 2021. Experimental results and cross-validation demonstrate a forecasting accuracy of 98.975%.","",https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-4615497/v1,"",,

Originally published4 Mar 2024https://doi.org/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.123.065486Circulation. 2024;149:729–731Unassailable evidence for the interdependence of human and planetary well-being necessitates a fundamental shift away from believing that one's personal health is distinct and separable from that of the planet. Rather, we are now confronted with the reality that personal and planetary welfare are interdependent, with the environment and social systems playing critical roles. The Global Burden of Disease investigators estimates that 9.2 million deaths per year are attributable to known environmental pollutants, with more than half resulting from cardiovascular causes alone, including myocardial infarctions, strokes, and heart failure.1–3 Exposure to environmental pollution alone is thus a singularly important risk factor for cardiovascular disease worldwide. It is important to note that the full public health effect of pollution on health (eg, metabolic, mental, cancers, and other systems) is difficult to fully characterize and is likely much larger than estimated. The relationship between personal and planetary health is best visualized through the analogy of the ""Raworth Donut"" which combines 2 concentric circles to depict the social and ecological boundaries that ensconce human health.1 An increasingly archaic social-environmental-infrastructural system based on resource extraction and consumption has already resulted in the transgression of multiple planetary boundaries and ironically impinges on further improvements in cardiovascular outcomes. Seen in this light, returning to the safe space of planetary health within the Raworth Donut should be considered an existential imperative and may be one of the greatest opportunities to improve human health. This brief review aims to highlight the inextricable connection between planetary and human health and the potential opportunities to improve both.Air pollution, derived principally from fossil fuel combustion, is one of the key man-made factors that characterizes the ""Anthropocene epoch,"" defined as when human activity has begun to alter the Earth's ecosystem. Air pollution contributes to more deaths per year than all wars, malaria, tuberculosis, HIV and other infectious disease combined, more than half of which are of cardiovascular origin.2 Robust evidence from animal and human studies has elucidated the mechanisms of air pollution–induced cardiovascular effects, which are mediated through diverse pathways involving hemodynamic, inflammatory, and thrombotic factors.4 An abundant body of evidence also implicates air pollution in the pathogenesis of traditional risk factors per se, most notably hypertension and diabetes. This impressive evidence base linking air pollution with cardiovascular disease was undoubtedly facilitated by the availability of a simple, standardizable, and scalable metric of air pollution, the mass of particulate matter ≤2.5 microns expressed as the micrograms per cubic meter of volume of ambient air. Despite the intrinsic complexity of its chemistry and sources, the measurement of particulate matter ≤2.5 microns using regional monitors, and eventually covering most of the global surface in 1×1 km grids using augmented information from satellite data, has allowed the derivation of integrated response exposure function and global burden estimates. Despite some limitations, this surrogate has been highly successful in robustly modeling health outcomes at regional, country, and global scales. However, because many additional environmental exposures, such as noise, nocturnal light, soil and waterborne chemical pollutants/toxins, and adverse features of the built environment (eg, lack of greenspaces) commonly cosegregate with air pollution, particularly in urban areas, alternate approaches that incorporate the sum of exposures and their effects or the aggregate, defined as the ""exposome,"" have been proposed. The integration of large-scale climate, environmental, social, and health data into common platforms and the use of machine learning and artificial intelligence tools to explore climate and human health effects in these datasets provide an unprecedented new opportunity to health effect assessment, and to inform policy, as well. Growing evidence fortunately shows that reducing environmental exposures, especially to air pollutants, is a powerful strategy to reduce cardiovascular diseases, lower all-cause mortality, and increase overall life expectancy.1–3 Approaches that lower environmental pollution will therefore not only protect planetary health but also serve to improve human well-being.The concept of ""residual environmental cardiovascular risk"" may entail a framework that considers the entire exposome (ie, a myriad of exposures to ""invisible"" environmental and social factors) that contribute to global cardiometabolic health, after traditional risk factors have been addressed.3 Addressing the sum totality of exposures may warrant a departure from the current ""one exposure at a time framework"" to simultaneous examination of multiple exposures that affect humans throughout most locations in the modern world in a near-continuous fashion and interact in additive (or even synergistic) ways.Focusing on complex multisector exposures will not only facilitate a holistic understanding of the public health threats posed by environmental and social factors but may also help drive improvements to integrated societal systems (eg, transportation or health care industries) and thus accelerate attainment of sustainable development goals as a whole. Fossil fuels currently power 7 key provisioning systems (food, energy, mobility-connectivity, housing, green infrastructure, water, and waste management) that lie at the core of human health, well-being, and sustainability. Transforming provisioning systems to a net-zero electricity grid, enabled by renewable electricity, can help to achieve the dual attainment of climate and health goals.4 Such an approach has the potential to simultaneously mitigate multiple adverse exposures, especially when combined with urban spatial planning that addresses a 5-dimensional ""5D"" framework (density of population, housing, and jobs; diversity of land use; design for multiple transport modes; destination access; and distance to public transport and other noncar modes). Following this urban model has the potential to increase physical activity (eg, walkability) while also reducing motor traffic–related exposures such as air pollution and noise. Low-carbon strategies being considered throughout the world, such as innovations in active transportation, micromobility, energy-efficient buildings, urban food gardens, recreation areas, commuting infrastructure (eg, biking lanes, walking paths), and a revival of interest in an urban infrastructure to address social determinants of health, while encouraging and helpful in reducing pollution and greenhouse gases, represent important steps forward. However, they may not be enough to meet climate and planetary goals. Moving from low-carbon to deep decarbonization and net-zero strategies will entail far more extensive system changes, necessitating the transformation of complex sociotechnical systems dependent on linear ""take-make-waste"" models and breaking out of interrelated technological and behavioral lock-ins. A tripartite strategy has been recommended together with pathways within each strategy4: (1) Reducing demand (through spatial planning, single-sector efficiencies in buildings, transportation, and green infrastructure). (2) Switching supplies to net-zero carbon electricity, renewable fuels, and materials through carbon valorization. (3) Carbon capture technologies.Phasing out fossil fuels and reducing anthropogenic air pollution will have measurable and immediate effects on health that have already been shown to outweigh upfront investment costs.5 The positive marginal economic value of decarbonization is its profoundly beneficial rapid effect on health.6 As one example, dramatic reductions in air pollution–related morbidity and mortality would be a direct result, especially in regions of the world where the absolute levels of exposure are higher (eg, Asia, Africa). These benefits contrast with the vastly larger timescales (eg, decades) over which climate improvements may be expected. More than half of the immediate health effect of air pollution reduction may relate to reduction in cardiovascular mortality and reduced hospitalizations.2 The effect on susceptible populations, in particular, racial minorities and the socially disadvantaged, that contribute disproportionately to cost of care may be quite substantive. However, the most important effect on human health of decarbonization may be through yet unrealized synergies that it may deliver.7 These include: (1) the adoption of public or active forms of travel together with electrification of transportation, contributing to reduced noise pollution and increased physical activity; (2) reduction in cardiovascular disease related to increased intake of locally sourced and sustainable plant-based ingredients that will result from decarbonization in the agricultural sector; (3) massive reduction in chemical exposures due to elimination of petroleum-based products and the corresponding improvement in risk factors such as hypertension, obesity, and diabetes. Many of the most heavily polluted areas worldwide unfortunately are in developing countries facing the greatest concurrent risk from cardiovascular disease and climate change. They unfortunately also face substantial barriers to a successful transition to a green economy that can help mitigate the twin syndemic of climate and cardiovascular disease. Given that human and planetary health, especially climate change, are by definition global issues, this problem will require multifaceted coordinated political and governmental policy action efforts from the community of nations to solve what may be well beyond well-intentioned market-based strategies tethered to economic incentives alone.8,9To avert environmental collapse, we must cut carbon in every sector including health care. The US health care sector pollutes more than any other industrialized health system in the world, accounting for 27% of all global health care greenhouse gas emissions. A staggering 82% of health care emissions have indirect origins related to the supply chain, including pharmaceuticals, water and waste management, equipment services, medical supplies, among others. Physicians have a moral obligation to advocate for decarbonization on the basis of the profound health effect of a fossil fuel–based economy and articulate these links to their patients and constituents. The health care sector can lead the way in decarbonization efforts by holding their suppliers and manufacturers accountable and mandating that all health care–related products be manufactured using sustainable approaches and renewable energy sources. Our very health depends on it.ARTICLE INFORMATIONSources of FundingThis study was funded by National Institutes of Health Grants 1R35ES031702 and R01ES017290.Disclosures None.FootnotesThe American Heart Association celebrates its 100th anniversary in 2024.

rayyan-210778899,Future Cities' Theories for Sustainable Future: A Systematic Literature Review,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"In recent decades, sustainability has surged as a pivotal topic in academic discourse, driven by heightened global awareness of its critical role in addressing climate change, biodiversity loss, and social inequities. Consequently, cities and local authorities are increasingly prioritizing sustainability integration into urban development strategies. However, the realization of the 2015 Sustainable Development Goals faces challenges, with only 12-15% of targets estimated to be met by the 2030 deadline. Scholars attribute this under-performance to the absence of a comprehensive approach to sustainable urban development. This study investigates the framework and mechanisms of mature future cities' theories in achieving sustainability, focusing on sustainable urban development principles. Through a systematic review utilizing Natural Language Processing and statistical analysis of over 27,000 SCOPUS documents, the research evaluates 43 future cities' theories from 1900 to 2023. Criteria such as comprehensiveness, consistency, empirical support, and applicability to sustainable development are analyzed. The study identifies mature theories like Smart City, Resilient City, and Sustainable City as promising avenues for sustainable urban development, albeit requiring refinement. The findings offer valuable insights to guide research and practice towards achieving sustainable urban development in cities.","",https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4808102,"",,

This requires reducing GHG emissions from grid-energy consumption (Scope 2 emissions), which is straightforward; however, it also requires reducing Scope 1 emissions, which include nitrous oxide and methane emissions, predominantly from wastewater handling and treatment.The pathways and factors leading to biological nitrous oxide and methane formation and emissions from wastewater are highly complex and site-specific. Good emission factors for estimating the Scope 1 emissions are lacking, water utilities have little experience in directly measuring these emissions, and the mathematical modelling of these emissions is challenging. Therefore, this book aims to help the water sector address the Scope 1 emissions by breaking down their pathways and influencing factors, and providing guidance on both the use of emission factors, and performing direct measurements of nitrous oxide and methane emissions from sewers and wastewater treatment plants. The book also dives into the mathematical modelling for predicting these emissions and provides guidance on the use of different mathematical models based upon your conditions, as well as an introduction to alternative modelling methods, including metabolic, data-driven, and AI methods. Finally, the book includes guidance on using the modelling tools for assessing different operating strategies and identifying promising mitigation actions.A must-have book for anyone needing to understand, account for, and reduce water utility Scope 1 emissions.ISBN: 9781789060454 (Paperback)ISBN: 9781789060461 (eBook)ISBN: 9781789060478 (ePub)","",https://doi.org/10.2166/9781789060461_0011,"",,

Using Landsat satellite datasets, this study investigated the complex interplay between urban Land Cover (LC) modification, fluctuation in Land Surface Temperature (LST) and severity of Urban Heat Island (UHI) from 1990 to 2020 in Peshawar city, Pakistan. Thermal bands were used to calculate LST and severity of UHI using Urban Thermal Field Variance Index (UTFVI). Furthermore, through Cellular Automata (CA), Logistic Regression (LR), and Artificial Neural Network (ANN), future predictions on thermal characteristics associated with land use changes were made. The results showed that the urban areas expanded by ~25% from 1990 to 2020, while ~10% decrease occurred in urban vegetation. The city will expand by ~45% and ~56% in 2035 and 2050, respectively. Notably, the results also demonstrated that urban hot spots were found the warmest with strongest UHI severity (34.02 oC), followed by the barren land (32.20 oC), and vegetation. The results further predicted an increase of LST (~55% and ~82%) and UTFVI (~62% and ~83%) in 2035 and 2050, respectively. These findings provide useful insights for policy makers and city planners to mitigate heat stress and to create a sustainable urban environment through the development of effective urban land use policies and urban greening.","",https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4843603,"",,
rayyan-210779052,A Comparative Analysis of Dynamic and Statistical Downscaling Techniques to Bridge the Gap Between the Regional and the Local Scale: Case Study for Nicosia,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"The Eastern Mediterranean and Middle East (EMME) region exhibits continuously accelerated warming, posing a significant threat to cities within this area and thus increasing their vulnerability to climate change. Regional Climate Models (RCMs) serve as valuable tools for climate simulations, but when the focus is given to the urban thermal environment the resolution of their output results is not sufficient. Downscaling techniques can be utilized to improve the spatial resolution of the RCMs and, hence, bridge this gap between the regional and the local scale. The downscaling techniques can be divided into two main categories, the dynamical (DD), and the empirical/statistical (ESD). While DD relies on physical schemes, its computational demands pose challenges for long-term simulations contrary to the ESD which is computationally inexpensive. In this study, both the DD and the ESD techniques are applied to downscale the 2m air temperature from the regional to the local scale for the city of Nicosia, the capital of Cyprus. Concerning the DD, the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model is used to downscale&amp;#160; the ERA5 re-analysis in three different domains, over the EMME region, Cyprus, and Nicosia, with a spatial horizontal resolution of 12km&amp;#215;12km, 4km&amp;#215;4km, 1km&amp;#215;1km respectively, over a 5-year historical period (2008-2012). Detailed information on the urban characteristics is incorporated into the WRF model through the coupling of the Single Layer Urban Canopy Model (SLUCM) as well as with the utilization of the state-of-the-art land use/land cover CGLC-MODIS-LCZ dataset. The ESD utilizes the generated database of the WRF model to establish statistical relationships between the regional and the local scale for the same period by employing advanced machine learning techniques, including Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and Multiple Linear Regression (MLR). A detailed comparative analysis between the two downscaling techniques as well as an evaluation of the simulation results against observation data from two meteorological stations are performed to assess their accuracy in estimating the air temperature over Nicosia.Key Words: WRF model; dynamical downscaling; statistical downscaling; urban climate modeling; Local Climate Zones","",https://doi.org/10.5194/ems2024-106,"",,

However, few studies have focused on the balance of carbon emission reduction and economic goals in spatial planning, and the governance influence on land use change simulation. This study addresses this gap by conducting an empirical analysis in the rapidly urbanizing area of Hangzhou, China, taking into consideration low‐carbon constraints and economic development demands. Using the stochastic impacts by regression on population, affluence, and technology (STRIPAT) model and linear programming–Markov, we simulate the governance decision‐making process to calculate the optimal land‐use structures under both low‐carbon and baseline scenario, then simulated land use patterns by using artificial‐neural‐network‐based cellular automata (ANN‐CA). The results showed 12.35% and 2.5% growth in urban and forest land, and 9.69% and 6.4% decline in farm and rural land under the low‐carbon scenario. 92.31% of urban land change occur in the downtown districts and suburbs; while 59.77% of farm land change and 95.53% of forest land change occur in the exurban districts. The low‐carbon performance of land use was reflected in carbon storage release, carbon emission capability change, and low‐carbon capability. The most common conversion of land use categories under the low‐carbon scenario was between farm and forest land, and between rural and urban land, which resulted in less carbon storage release and carbon emissions compared with the baseline scenario. Furthermore, under the low‐carbon scenario, the compactness of construction land increased by 2 × 10 −5 , while its fragmentation decreased by 0.0027. This study sheds light on the impact of low‐carbon‐oriented land use planning on urban land expansion, providing empirical evidence for city governments in rapid urbanization areas to improve land use efficiency.","",https://doi.org/10.1111/tgis.13199,"",,

Crowdsourcing, facilitated by digital technologies, has emerged as a novel methodological advance for accessing subjective place-based information, allowing the public to produce and share photographs at an unprecedented scale. As people can now readily capture and disseminate images on social media from virtually any location, these photographs contribute to the digital representation of places. Many studies have leveraged social media imagery to explore mental maps of cities, place perceptions, and ecosystem services. This raises fundamental questions: What are the UGBSs that promote photography across cities? What are the similarities and differences among cities’ photogenic UGBSs? And how do cities’ photogenic UGBSs relate to the happiness of their inhabitants? This study investigates these questions through an analysis of 203,020 photographs, taken from social media, of sites across 186 cities over a five-year period (2014 to 2018). Employing Google Cloud Vision and topic modelling with a state-of-the-art neural network model, photographs are clustered and used to identify cross-city features. The correlation between prevalence of photogenic UGBSs and levels of happiness is investigated using linear regression analysis. The results show that UGBSs eliciting photography practice are predominantly characterised by water-related subjects, confirming a widespread aesthetic appreciation for urban blue spaces. Perceptions of UGBSs exhibit significant variability among cities, offering a metric to assess environmental policy efficacy. Lastly, a positive association is found in high-income contexts between number of social media photographs of UGBSs and subjective well-being, while this correlation is not significant in middle- and low-income contexts. This sheds light on human–nature relationships by providing global evidence of how aesthetic appreciation of urban nature influences human well-being.","",https://doi.org/10.2218/ear.2024.8930,"",,

In this context, green roofs (GRs) emerge as a sustainable and innovative solution to mitigate these issues by absorbing rainfall, reducing runoff, and enhancing urban biodiversity. Despite the apparent benefits, the adoption of GRs remains limited, largely due to a lack of quantitative understanding of the factors that influence urban residents' GR adoption willingness. This study aims to fill this knowledge gap via a survey approach, and distribute and collect survey responses from 999 residents in Shenzhen, a rapidly developing coastal city in China. The survey is designed to capture a range of variables that may influence residents' decision-making regarding GR adoption, including demographic information, housing characteristics, waterlogging experiences, roof utilization preference, knowledge of and preference for GR, and willingness to adopt GR. The GR adoption willingness is collected assuming two policy scenarios, one with government subsidy and the other without. By leveraging a machine learning model for data analysis, the study identifies five key predictors that commonly influence GR adoption willingness with and without subsidy: recognition of the advantages of GRs (GR_advantage), whether a resident lives on the top floor (Top_floor), the degree of concern about GRs (GR_concern), the duration of waterlogging experienced in and around the community (WL_time), and the individual's level of education (Education). Interestingly, the study also reveals that GR adoption willingness is affected differently under scenarios with and without policy incentives. In the absence of subsidies, the property fee (Pro_fee) is a significant factor; conversely, when policy incentives are present, age and house ownership (House_own) emerge as influential factors. The complexity of these influencing factors is further evaluated using the SHAP (SHapley Additive explanation) model, which provides a nuanced interpretation of how these factors interact and exert nonlinear impacts on residents' willingness to adopt GRs. The insights derived from this analysis are critical for policymakers and urban planners who are looking to promote GRs as part of an integrated urban water management strategy. Specifically, a combination of long-term subsidies and one-time subsidies can be combined to motivate residential adoption. Recognizing the general unfamiliarity with GRs and related policies among residents, relevant outreach and education programs are essential. In addition, targeted subsidy levels could be helpful in stimulating more GR adoptions. An important consideration in this targeting process is the frequency of waterlogging events, which has been shown to significantly influence residents' willingness to pay for GRs. &amp;#160;","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu24-11013,"",,
rayyan-210779320,Ecosystem services supply-demand mismatches for urban heat mitigation&amp;#160;,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Urban areas, characterized by dense construction, often exhibit elevated land surface temperatures, leading to the formation of urban heat islands (UHIs). These UHIs pose significant environmental hazards, contributing to issues such as heat-related mortality, degraded air quality, and elevated heat stress on biodiversity and ecosystems. Moreover, the impact of UHIs is not uniformly distributed due to the heterogeneous nature of urban landscapes and socio-spatial inequities influencing factors like impervious surfaces and vegetation cover. Urban green infrastructure is increasingly valued as a nature-based solution to mitigate UHIs, offering essential ecosystem services (ES) like urban heat mitigation. To analyze the relationship between users' access and dependence on these benefits, we propose a modeling approach that integrates remote sensing, field, and socio-demographic data, along with Artificial Intelligence for Environment and Sustainability (ARIES) and GIS tools. This approach incorporates: i) indicators of UHI exposure and urban heat vulnerability indices; ii) spatial quantification of the supply and demand of urban green infrastructure related to ES for UHI mitigation; iii) spatially explicit (mis)matches of ES supply and demand balance and iv) coupled modelling. We applied it in the &amp;#8216;green&amp;#8217; city of Vitoria-Gasteiz, in the Basque Country as a case study. Our findings evidence the unequal distribution of UHI burdens, with individuals vulnerable to heat experiencing disproportionate impacts, including higher exposure and limited access to temperature-regulating ES. This mismatch between the supply and demand of ES particularly affects disadvantaged communities. Conversely, areas associated with higher income levels indicate reduced vulnerability to heat. Incorporating environmental justice principles into UHI mitigation strategies is essential to ensure equitable outcomes for all residents. By considering the socio-spatial inequalities associated with supply-demand mismatches in ES and their impact on vulnerability to heat, our approach enables evidence-based decision-making and spatial prioritization to address the specific needs of vulnerable populations.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu24-607,"",,
rayyan-210779391,Mapping Research Trends in Global Climate Change Adaptation to Flood Disasters: A Bibliometric Analysis using VOSviewer,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Using a bibliometric analysis, this study aims to map the research trends and thematic developments in climate change adaptation to flood disasters. Data from 812 publications, spanning from 1996 to 2023, were retrieved from the Scopus database and analyzed using VOSviewer software to visualize keyword co-occurrence networks. The analysis identified five key thematic clusters: adaptation strategies and resilience (180 publications), urban planning and green infrastructure (150 publications), flood risk management (85 publications), early warning systems (60 publications), and socio-economic impacts such as health and displacement (100 publications). Over time, research output has significantly increased, particularly after 2015, with publications peaking at 150 in 2023. Regionally, Asia leads the research output with 200 publications, followed by Europe (180 publications) and North America (120 publications). The findings highlight a shift toward sustainable, nature-based solutions and the integration of advanced technologies such as machine learning in flood management. The increasing focus on the socio-economic dimensions of flood adaptation, particularly in vulnerable communities, underscores the need for more inclusive approaches.

rayyan-210779525,"Spatio-temporal evolution of Land Use Land Cover and hydrological components in the Lake Kivu catchment, Rwanda.",,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"The African Great Lakes Region has experienced substantial Land Use and Land Cover Change (LULCC) over the last decades, significantly impacting landscapes and ecosystems. The main drivers of LULCC in the region involve a complex interplay of political, economic, and socio-demographic factors. This study focused on the Lake Kivu catchment in Rwanda, a critical ecosystem in the African Great Lakes Regions, exploring both historical and future LULC scenarios. The methodology involved supervised image classification using seasonal composites and integrating spectral indices with topographic features to capture dynamic seasonal variations. Historical LULCC analysis showed significant changes, particularly the first decade of the study (1990-2000) marked by substantial forest loss (from 26.6% to 18.7%) and a notable increase in agricultural land (from 27.7% to 43%). These changes were attributed to conflicts in the region and population movements. Subsequent decades (2000-2010 and 2010-2020) witnessed marked forest recovery (24.8% by 2020) and a balance between agricultural increase and loss, reflecting Rwanda's commitment to environmental conservation. Additionally, a multi-layer perceptron artificial neural network was employed to predict future LULC scenarios, considering natural and socio-economic explanatory variables with historical LULC transitions. The predicted future LULC for 2030 and 2050 indicate distinct trajectories influenced by factors like political will, demographic trends, and socio-economic developments. By integrating the observed historical trends and predicted future LULC, along with climate scenarios, this study will use a hydrological model to understand the impacts of these changes on the catchment&amp;#8217;s hydrological components. Providing essential insights for policy and strategic planning, we explore how the intricate dynamics of water-related ecosystem services are influenced by LULC and climate changes, with the ultimate goal of harmonizing ecological sustainability with socio-economic development in the Lake Kivu catchment and similar environments.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu24-9350,"",,
rayyan-210779549,Temporal change in relationships between urban structure and surface temperature,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Surface temperature influences human health directly and alters the biodiversity and productivity of the environment. While previous research has identified that the composition of urban landscapes influences the physical properties of the environment such as surface temperature, a generalizable and flexible framework is needed that can be used to compare cities across time and space. This study employs the Structure of Urban Landscapes (STURLA) classification combined with remote sensing of New York City’s land surface temperature (LST). These are then linked using machine learning and statistical modeling to identify how greenspace and the built environment influence urban surface temperature. Further, changes in urban structure are then connected to changes in LST over time. It was observed that areas with urban units composed of largely the built environment hosted the hottest temperatures while those with vegetation and water were coolest. Likewise, this is reinforced by borough-level spatial differences in both urban structure and heat. Comparison of these relationships over the period between 2008 and 2017 identified changes in surface temperature that are likely due to the changes in the presence of water, low-rise buildings, and pavement across the city. This research reinforces how human alteration of the environment changes LST and offers units of analysis that can be used for research and urban planning.","",https://doi.org/10.1177/23998083221083677,"",,
rayyan-210779567,Introduction,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"With increased commitment from the international community to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from all sectors in accordance with the Paris Agreement, the water sector has never felt the pressure it is now under to transition to a low-carbon water management model. This requires reducing GHG emissions from grid-energy consumption (Scope 2 emissions), which is straightforward; however, it also requires reducing Scope 1 emissions, which include nitrous oxide and methane emissions, predominantly from wastewater handling and treatment.The pathways and factors leading to biological nitrous oxide and methane formation and emissions from wastewater are highly complex and site-specific. Good emission factors for estimating the Scope 1 emissions are lacking, water utilities have little experience in directly measuring these emissions, and the mathematical modelling of these emissions is challenging. Therefore, this book aims to help the water sector address the Scope 1 emissions by breaking down their pathways and influencing factors, and providing guidance on both the use of emission factors, and performing direct measurements of nitrous oxide and methane emissions from sewers and wastewater treatment plants. The book also dives into the mathematical modelling for predicting these emissions and provides guidance on the use of different mathematical models based upon your conditions, as well as an introduction to alternative modelling methods, including metabolic, data-driven, and AI methods. Finally, the book includes guidance on using the modelling tools for assessing different operating strategies and identifying promising mitigation actions.A must-have book for anyone needing to understand, account for, and reduce water utility Scope 1 emissions.ISBN: 9781789060454 (Paperback)ISBN: 9781789060461 (eBook)ISBN: 9781789060478 (ePub)","",https://doi.org/10.2166/9781789060461_0001,"",,

To facilitate the development of such innovations in the realm of urban technology, it is imperative to explore the migration of patented artificial intelligence (AI) applications into the urban environment as well as to discuss the degrees of, prevalence of, and types of AI. However, scholarly research on urban technology tends to neglect the research and development (R&D) expenditures linked to this expansion. This present study focuses on AI patents as a fundamental driver for the proliferation of AI applications within cities, taking factors into account, such as the concentration of the population in urban centers and the levels/volume of allocation of R&D expenditure. By conducting a panel data analysis on 18 countries that have demonstrated internationally noted practices in smart city development, the study reveals compelling findings that underscore the positive impact of augmented R&D expenditures on the generation of AI patents, surpassing the effects of corresponding expenditure increases. These findings suggest that policymakers can reasonably view R&D investment as a favorable policy approach to foster advancements and applications in commercially underpinned but societally beneficial AI.","",https://doi.org/10.1080/10630732.2023.2289818,"",,

rayyan-210779706,"Anticipatory Climate Resilience in Coastal Urban Areas: Transformative Impact of Predictive Analysis, AI Solutions, and Innovative Indices",,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"In the intricate tapestry of coastal urban areas, the realities of climate change unfold with discernible impacts across regions like Nigeria, Chad, Cameroon, Rwanda, Somalia, and Kenya. Experiencing a spectrum of climate-related challenges, from extreme weather patterns to rising sea levels, these areas underscore the pressing need for proactive measures. The Lake Chad Basin, encompassing Nigeria, Chad, and Cameroon, grapples with heightened climate upheavals, exacerbating existing insecurities. Simultaneously, nations in East Africa, such as Rwanda, Somalia, and Kenya, navigate the repercussions of unpredictable weather patterns affecting agriculture, water resources, and community livelihoods. The humanitarian community, entrenched in its response, often finds itself constrained by the reactive nature of interventions. Here, the transformative potential of predictive analysis and artificial intelligence (AI) shines a light on proactive measures. Consider the INFORM Climate Change Index1, a forward-looking projection providing quantified estimates of climate change impacts on the future risk of humanitarian crises and disasters. Developed through collaboration between the Euro-Mediterranean Center on Climate Change and the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission, this innovative index modifies indicators in the hazard and exposure dimensions based on projected climate and socio-economic trends. The link between anticipatory humanitarian action and predictive analysis becomes more apparent when we delve into the numbers. Incorporating digital solutions, especially AI, significantly boosts the effectiveness of anticipatory measures. Recent initiatives show that when predictive analysis, AI-driven solutions, and innovative indices are integrated, a substantial percentage of climate-related events can be avoided. These digital tools empower coastal urban communities to construct preemptive barriers, devise effective mitigation strategies, and navigate challenges with resilience. The transformative impact is not just theoretical; it's quantifiable, with numbers indicating that a significant portion of potential crises can be averted through proactive measures informed by predictive analytics. This groundbreaking approach, where digital solutions are seamlessly integrated into anticipatory humanitarian action, transforms coastal urban communities from mere responders to architects of their climate destinies. The narrative, rooted in real-world examples and bolstered by numerical evidence, showcases the tangible benefits of technology. The path forward involves AI, predictive analysis, and innovative indices as indispensable tools in scripting resilience stories. As we explore the depths of climate-induced insecurities across diverse regions, the abstract underscores the pivotal role of AI, coupled with innovative indices like INFORM Climate Change, in guiding coastal urban communities towards a future where climate challenges are met with informed, proactive, and resilient responses. 1https://drmkc.jrc.ec.europa.eu/inform-index/INFORM-Climate-Change","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu24-20281,"",,

This study explores the application of NASA's Black Marble daily data in monitoring post-typhoon responses. In a landscape characterised by a high mix of urban built-up areas and peri-urban villages, we investigate differences in nighttime light recovery across various land-use types after disasters. Combining interpretable machine learning, we explore the reasons behind these disparities by comparing Shapley values and specific Accumulated Local Effects (ALE) between regions, evaluating high importance of individual predictive factors and identifying potential non-linear patterns and threshold effects.&amp;#160; Our findings reveal more instances of sustained nighttime light decline in rural areas (residential and agricultural land), while urban areas exhibit increased nighttime light during disasters. These differences primarily relate to infrastructure features, especially roads. Meteorological factors, such as precipitation probability and wind speed, impact NTL predictions in urban and rural areas. Post-disaster relief activities significantly influence NTL changes in rural settlements. Additionally, the occurrence of extreme weather increases the likelihood of cascading disasters. Our study finds that disaster impact zones in coastal areas extend deeper into the mainland, posing threats to adjacent mountainous regions and elevating the risk of secondary disasters like landslides.&amp;#160; In conclusion, this study provides a regional assessment of resilience differences and influencing mechanisms using nighttime light data. It offers valuable information for policymakers to identify key factors influencing typhoon disaster resilience, enabling them to mitigate systemic risks and enhance overall system resilience.

As satellite data become available at higher spatial (3–10 m) and temporal (1–3 days) resolution, new opportunities arise to map and quantify urban area changes. While deep learning (DL) models have recently shown great performance when dealing with satellite data, their training requires a lot of labeled data which are not necessarily available at global scale. Satellite benchmark datasets, commonly used to advance methods, provide labeled data, but are rarely used for mapping and area estimation outside the training data. In this study, we aim to utilize the Sentinel-2-based benchmark dataset, Onera Satellite Change Detection (OSCD), to train a DL model and analyze its performance at local scale to map urban land use changes, estimate area of changes and provide characterization of changes. We apply the model over the Washington DC–Baltimore area for 2018–2019. We show that in just one year almost 1% of the total urban area underwent changes with the majority coming from the construction of commercial buildings, followed by residential buildings.

rayyan-210779789,Long-term hydrological budget over urban areas: approaches and challenges,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Urbanisation substantially alters the permeability of the land surface and modifies the vegetation cover extent and type. These landcover changes profoundly affect the hydrological and energy budget. While the role of urbanization on the local flood response has been extensively studied, its effect on the long-term hydrological budget is much less known as computing the latent heat flux (evapotranspiration) in urban areas is still challenging. However, knowledge on the urban hydrological budget is important as many cities are planning water sensitive urban designs and water harvesting could be key to support an increasing amount of urban vegetation. This study quantifies how urbanization changed the long-term hydrological budget of the island city state Singapore for the period between 1982 to 2021. To do so, we use two state-of-the-art mechanistic models which include all the major hydrological components such as runoff, soil and interception water storage, transpiration, and evaporation. The first is Tethys-Chloris (T&amp;amp;C), which is a mechanistic ecohydrological model that can resolve the water, carbon and energy budgets at high spatio-temporal resolutions but considers the urban effects in a simplistic way by only modifying the impervious fraction of the land surface and its roughness. The second is its urban counterpart, Urban Tethys-Chloris (UT&amp;amp;C), which explicitly resolves shading and radiation reflection within an urban canyon accounting for different urban vegetation types and configurations and explicitly resolves the local urban climate and hydrology. UT&amp;amp;C is however too computationally costly to simulate an entire city at high spatial resolution. Hence, a machine learning approach, where a multimodal neural network comprising a Conv1D layer followed by LSTM layers for dynamic meteorological inputs and Dense layers for static inputs such as urban properties, is used to re-map UT&amp;amp;C outputs over the entire city based on a few selected covariates. By cross comparing the different approaches to compute the long-term water budget over urban areas, we highlight the involved uncertainties, and we can gain insights into the impact of urban development on modifying the water availability in Singapore. The island city-state relies on water harvesting as one source of water supply for households and knowledge of water availability is extremely important for long-term water management purposes.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu24-13909,"",,
rayyan-210779827,Featured Collection Introduction: “Connecting Land and Water for Healthy Communities”,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"This featured collection is a part of growing public policy conversation, professional practice, and academic research focused on the need and strategies to integrate land use and water planning. The need arises from fragmentation in the ways that professionals think about and have been organized to deal with land and water in their workplaces and professional organizations. However, there is an increasing recognition that land and water planning must be done jointly because how we use land shapes our demand for water and greatly impacts water quality, while the way we use and manipulate water involves significant changes to land. Integrative land–water strategies are the focus of this featured collection. The collection's purpose is to contribute to fostering land and water connections across the physical, social, and ecological domains. Here we provide a brief background on the origins of this featured collection in a 2021 specialty conference organized and hosted by the American Water Resources Association (AWRA) and the Babbitt Center for Land and Water Policy (Babbitt Center), and done in collaboration with many other sponsors, supporters, and participating organizations. We cover other activities associated with the 2021 specialty conference and plans for continuing conversations at a 2023 follow-up conference. We also highlight some of the themes and insights from this featured collection. Finally, we invite continuing submissions on integrating land and water to the Journal of the American Water Resources Association (JAWRA), which is planning another featured collection on this important topic. This featured collection11 While the guest associate editors of this collection were involved in the conference and are co-authors of some of the publications included here, none of them handled their own submissions and standard blind peer review procedures were strictly followed. The papers also adhered to all other editorial and peer review requirements of the journal. emerged from the 2021 virtual summer specialty conference entitled “Connecting Land and Water for Healthy Communities” (AWRA and Babbitt Center 2021a). The conference was the result of a collaboration between Jim Holway of the Babbitt Center for Land and Water Policy (a center of the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy) and Sharon Megdal of the Water Resources Research Center at the University of Arizona and board member of AWRA. Jim and Sharon are long-time colleagues and friends as well as practitioners and scholars of land and water integration, especially as it pertains to the Colorado River Basin. They served as the conference committee co-chairs from the two partnering host organizations, AWRA and Babbitt Center, and involved leaders and representatives from other national organizations on the conference committee. Those organizations included the Alliance for Water Efficiency (AWE), American Planning Association (APA), American Water Works Association (AWWA), United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), United States Water Alliance, and Water Research Foundation (WRF). Even more organizations were involved on the host and program committees, including representatives from foundations, utilities, universities, private firms, and various state, tribal and federal agencies. Members of the conference, host and program committees comprised the larger conference planning committee (AWRA and Babbitt Center 2021b). The 2021 AWRA specialty conference built on several previous efforts. The APA hosted “Water and Planning Connect” in Kansas City from September 11 to 12, 2018, the first conference aimed at bringing together land use planning and water management professionals from the public and private sectors. The conference addressed the pressing issues at the intersection of land and water, including the effects of climate change, aging infrastructure, and water equity, and how to overcome fragmentation in responding to these large-scale challenges. “Water and Planning Connect” followed several years of activities within APA aimed at recognizing the importance of integrating water into land use planning. These activities included a 2016 update of the APA Policy Guide on Water (APA 2016), the 2017 formation of APA's Water and Planning Network (WPN) (APA 2017), and the 2017 publication of PAS WPN Report 588, “Planners and Water” (Cesanek et al. 2017). More recently, several experts directly involved in these efforts have authored additional publications on the potential impact comprehensive plans have to address land and water integration at a local level (Rouse and Piro 2021; Rugland 2021). APA is an organization largely consisting of land use planners, and its recognition of the importance of considering water in land use planning and corresponding practice-related activities has been a significant contribution. The reciprocal importance of considering the implications of land use planning for water management was brought to the fore in the 2021 “Connecting Land and Water for Healthy Communities” conference by Jim and Sharon along with the original inceptors, Chi Ho Sham of AWWA, William (Bill) Cesanek of APA, and Mary Ann Dickinson, past president of AWE. AWRA, an organization largely consisting of water resource professionals, reached out to land use planners in an effort to connect the professional realms of land and water just as APA did to its water constituents for “Water and Planning Connect” in 2018. The AWRA and Babbitt Center specialty conference was held virtually from July 19 to 21, 2021 and featured keynote speakers Tanya Trujillo, United States Department of the Interior Assistant Secretary for Water and Science, and Aziza Akhmouch, Head of the Urban Policies and Sustainable Development Division within the Centre for Entrepreneurship, SMEs, Regions and Cities of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). The conference also included a pre- and post-conference workshop, two panels, 24 technical sessions, crowdsourcing land and water dialogues, and networking opportunities (AWRA and Babbitt Center 2021c). The mix of activities was designed to bring together practitioners and researchers across the intersecting areas of water management, land use planning, natural resources policy, and related technical and design professions. The conference focused on fostering relationships among water resources management, utility operations, and land use planning and design to strengthen connections across disciplines, professions, and organizations. Topics included land and water aspects of water supply, water demand management, stormwater management, wastewater treatment, community planning and design, conservation, and integrated “one water” approaches. The key theme running throughout the conference was the recognition that connecting land and water is necessary for healthy and resilient communities and that new tools and evidence-based strategies are needed to foster and evaluate experiences with making those connections. This featured collection is just one of the several activities associated with the 2021 “Connecting Land and Water for Healthy Communities” conference. Here we highlight three of them. Preceding the July 2021 conference, AWRA published a special issue of Water Resources IMPACT (March/April 2021, Volume 23, Number 2) on “Connecting Land and Water for Healthy Communities” (AWRA 2021a). The issue was guest edited by Mike Antos, who wrote in “About this Issue” (p. 1): “Arguably, managing water separately from land was one of the great missteps of the 20th century. Turning our eyes to past practices, and recognizing the role watersheds play in the health of the environment and our communities, we see that land and water must be managed together as integrated social-natural systems … I am proud as guest editor to share these stories and examples of how land use managers and water managers are rediscovering the power of partnering for the benefit of people and the environment.” This special issue of Water Resources IMPACT included eight articles introducing important perspectives and work related to the conference theme. Case studies from all over the country focused on integrative land–water solutions, bringing attention to vulnerable communities in flood-prone areas and areas impacted by drought, and specific ways in which strategies for greater integration is key to addressing this vulnerability. This special issue of Water Resource IMPACT was a valuable introduction to topics and actions taking place on the ground in communities that were incorporated into the 2021 specialty conference. One major outcome of the 2021 Conference was the “Findings Statement and Call to Action from the Specialty Conference: Connecting Land & Water for Healthy Communities” which was approved by AWRA with the Babbitt Center for Land and Water Policy, the APA Water and Planning Network, and the AWWA. After the conference, members of the planning committee came together and agreed on the importance of actualizing integrative land and water solutions. Together, they drafted a “Findings Statement” of key conclusions they drew from the diversity of presentations and conversations throughout the conference. These findings acknowledge the major ways fragmentation occurs and how it results in unsustainable patterns of growth and resource utilization that increase vulnerabilities of communities to water and land-related risks. Realizing that a findings statement was not enough, they included a “Call to Action” to encourage their organizations, other conference participants, and the land and water professional community at large to implement the set of guiding principles included in the findings statement. This “Findings Statement and Call to Action” was approved as an official AWRA Policy Statement (AWRA 2021b) and is also reprinted here in this featured collection (AWRA et al. 2021). We are pleased that the productive conversations will continue, and the land and water community will have opportunities to discuss how it is implementing the Call to Action by bringing forth more examples and lessons. In July of 2023, AWRA will be hosting the second specialty conference on the general theme of “Connecting Land and Water for Healthy Communities,” scheduled for July 17 to 19, 2023 in Denver, Colorado (AWRA 2022). Our hope is that this collection of activities, research, and partnerships and yet another opportunity to meet, this time in person in Denver, Colorado, will indeed inspire additional collaborations, new ideas and inquiries, and creative and bold actions that continue leading to implementation of integrative land–water solutions. The 2021 “Connecting Land & Water for Healthy Communities” specialty conference suggests that to ensure healthy and resilient communities, connecting planning and management of land and water is necessary. Moreover, the “Findings Statement and Call to Action” from this conference urges connections between multiple stakeholders and stakeholder groups and utilization of science, tools, practices, and technologies that integrate land and water planning and use. The integration of land and water planning is the foundational thread of the articles in this featured collection. However, the articles also showcase the ways in which integrative land–water solutions can be focused or more expansive in response to diverse stakeholders and varying circumstances and depending on how and where integration can be applied and adapted. Cross-cutting themes emerged in each of these pieces, including issues of scale, context, complexity; the need for new research, new ways of knowing, new tools; working in interdisciplinary teams and spanning boundaries across professions and organizations; the need for local as well as regional land–water coordination; and the use of an institutional lens in recognition of ways society can work more collectively toward larger scale societal sustainability. Stoker et al. (2022) begin this collection with a review of regulatory and non-regulatory strategies for integrated land–water solutions. The authors synthesize existing literature and emphasize the need for new research to establish the evidentiary basis to support the implementation of these strategies, prioritize one strategy over another, and determine the contexts in which various strategies are likely to be most effective. The scales inherent in both regulatory and non-regulatory strategies are apparent in each of the manuscripts included in this featured collection. Turner et al. (2022) also describe differences in scale between local ordinances, which can better integrate water and land use, vs. federal level regulations like the Clean Water Act that focus only on water quality. Sampson et al. (2022) look at city policies and water demand by examining a range of neighborhood housing typologies (essentially different scales of housing density) and conducting scenario planning analyses across the Denver Water service area. Wang and Vivoni (2022) employ regional scenario modeling to investigate the implications of climate and land use and land cover for future irrigation water demand in different cities, irrigation districts, and counties in central Arizona as well as at the regional scale. Endter-Wada et al. (2022) illustrate the scales of governance and institutional influence including examples of policies, processes, and projects at federal, state, local, and utility scales. They focus on cooperation and partnership between and within these scales to mobilize sustainability transitions. Jacobs et al. (2022) focus on the need to integrate planning across scales since different environmental issues occur and are dealt with through institutions with authority and influence in varying geographies (e.g., state, watershed, irrigation district, municipal, and individual property). Highlighting the importance of scale, the manuscripts in this featured collection show that context is an important aspect of integrated land–water management. Turner et al. (2022) note that stormwater professionals stated that multiple factors were part of their stormwater infrastructure decision making, including watershed-scale issues and other added complexities like climate change and social norms (complexities also suggested by Jacobs et al. 2022). They also find regional differences in stormwater professionals' decision making related to water quality (eastern states) vs. water quantity (western states) and potentials for green infrastructure solutions to more effectively help them link land and water. Although Sampson et al. (2022) found that incremental increases in residential density is one way to improve urban water efficiency, policies that reduce outdoor irrigation may have more success at reducing outdoor water demand than policies purely focused on increasing residential densities. They conclude that variations that relate to building type and specific density configurations are important contextual complexities to consider in understanding and managing urban water demand and outdoor water efficiency. Wang and Vivoni (2022) suggest that local contextual differences such as future land use change trajectories combined with climate change predictions are very important elements to consider in irrigation water use projections. Endter-Wada et al. (2022) show how integrating land and water can occur in numerous ways and result in distinctive forms. In their four examples, the integration occurs through analysis, by design, from conceptual borrowing, and via facilitation and, despite general application to many communities, it is context that determines specific outcomes, adopted practices, and instituted policies. Jacobs et al. (2022) highlight that environmental challenges are highly context dependent, including being influenced by social norms, population/demographic changes, and physical and climatic differences. Jacobs et al.’s (2022) call to look at “the intersection of the climate-land use-energy-water systems collectively” (p. 2) is an important consideration in this featured collection looking at integrated water–land planning. The authors remind us that even looking at two issues in an integrated way ignores the true complexity of the issues at hand. Sampson et al. (2022) and Wang and Vivoni's (2022) manuscripts provide focused examinations of water and land use interactions, which are important pieces of the puzzle in terms of water conservation and use. Yet, each manuscript also provides important insights through recognition and analysis of additional components that add complexity. Sampson et al. (2022) simulate the effects of human activity (building types where households choose to live) and other behavioral and technological changes (gains in irrigation efficiency) in addition to increasing housing density on future water demand. Wang and Vivoni's (2022) inclusion of climate change effects as well as differing modes of future land change related to urban growth shows how differences in irrigation water use can become even more pronounced in the future. Their works and insights could be built upon to include even more complexity (e.g., equity in housing; interactions between housing, water and transportation; implications of agricultural land loss on food, fuel, and fiber). Endter-Wada et al.’s (2022) examples speak to the institutional changes needed to move resilient solutions forward. Although the authors looked specifically at integrated land–water solutions, Endter-Wada et al. (2022) show the importance of partnerships and stakeholder engagement to foster institutional transformation that could translate to increasingly complex issues. Recognition of the importance of complexities at the intersection of climate, land use, energy, and water systems (CLEWs) is critical for stretching our analysis and understanding of problems and challenging and enabling us to find appropriate solutions. But it does not negate the need to work at the intersection of land and water. The reason linking land and water remains important is because human interaction with the environment occurs through the processes of using land and water and, increasingly, through processes of large-scale land use change and water manipulation, all of which are driven by social processes. Land changes to the surface of the earth affect the water cycle, especially large-scale urbanization in arid regions and development in flood-prone riparian and coastal areas in humid regions. Similarly, changes to natural water sources and flows affect the land, most dramatically illustrated when water diversions result in desiccated lakes, dry streams, and loss of wetlands, or when water is diverted from basins of origin, often to the detriment of human and ecological communities located on tribal and rural lands. Human changes to land or water without regard to impacts resulting from their linkage are dramatically changing the earth's surface. These changes are resulting in cascading effects on socio-ecological systems and on larger physical and climatic earth system processes. Changes occurring at the interface of land and water policy, planning, and management remain foundational because numerous government agencies have well-established regulatory and management authority over land and/or water as well as deeply rooted professional and institutional cultures where changes are key to societal sustainability transitions. Finally, the authors of the manuscripts and the associate editors of this featured collection suggest the following topics to consider exploring and using in future research and practice. We should strive to create comprehensive open-source data and use exploratory processes and data-driven tools to examine complex issues so that we can learn from each other and provide better decision support, the value of which is illustrated in the articles by Sampson et al. (2022) and Wang and Vivoni (2022). The need to determine metrics to examine water outcome goals and to use these metrics to understand success over time across case studies and contexts was emphasized by Stoker et al. (2022) and suggested in various ways throughout this collection. Developing paths forward to allow for adaptive management in planning, policy, and rulemaking and for institutional transformations rely not only on good analytic and evaluative techniques, but on the ability to build and use interdisciplinary teams, partnerships, and champions of new ideas to work on complex issues, as reinforced in the articles by Turner et al. (2022) and Endter-Wada et al. (2022). Issues at the intersections of climate–land use–energy–water systems are critical, as the questions raised in table 1 by Jacobs et al. (2022) indicate, which highlights why creating frameworks for coordination and integration across scales is so important. As the “Findings Statement and Call to Action” reminds us, integrating equity, health, and safety should be at the heart of every inquiry and practice, and our professions need to commit to guiding principles that help us keep this focus at the forefront of our work. The focus on “Connecting Land and Water for Healthy Communities” in the March/April issue of Water Resource IMPACT, the 2021 specialty conference and resulting “Findings Statement and Call to Action,” and this featured collection of JAWRA all contribute to recognizing land–water disconnections and finding integrated solutions for overcoming them. Much work needs to be done to understand the many dimensions, meanings, and implications of integrating land and water, to promote practices and technologies for facilitating integration, and to evaluate, test, and document the short- and long-term outcomes from integration (Quay et al. 2022). We look forward to land use and water management professionals' joint contributions to this work and to expanding our collective learning and conversations at the second AWRA summer specialty conference on this topic from July 17 to 19, 2023 in Denver, Colorado. Data sharing is not applicable to this article as no new data were created or analyzed in this study.","",https://doi.org/10.1111/1752-1688.13042,"",,
rayyan-210779856,Pluvial Flooding Risk Mitigation: a machine learning approach for optimal management of an urban drainage system,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the variability of extreme rainfall events is increasing in many locations. The continuous expansion of urban areas makes urban flooding more common, thus increasing the need for improved management of drainage systems in large cities. Urban pluvial flooding (UPF) occurs when surface runoff cannot be efficiently conveyed into the drainage system, due to intense rainfall events exceeding the capacity of stormwater drainage systems, or due to inlets' poor maintenance which are often either partially or fully blocked. Many drainage systems may not be efficient due to outdated design approaches that do not consider these aspects. Therefore, there is a need to improve the design of structures and to prioritize risk adaptation and mitigation strategies to build resilient cities against the effects of pluvial flooding. During extreme rainfall events generating pluvial flooding, discharges exceeding the sewer system capacity are diverted by sewer overflows. For this reason, the objective of this work consists of defining a methodology to determine the optimal management strategy to mitigate sewer overflows using machine learning techniques. Here we simulate pluvial flooding within a large urban area by using the freely available Storm Water Management Model EPA-SWMM, based on a detailed reproduction of the geometric characteristics of a branch of the drainage network in a large city. By simulating the different propagation effects of synthetic hyetographs in the pipelines and artefacts, the dynamic operating conditions of the actual network are performed using machine learning techniques, by applying Python to the SWMM data model (PySWMM). The project, which is ongoing, thus aims at the optimal management of the combined overflow devices of a sewer system through their real time control during a flood event to mitigate pluvial flooding risk in urban areas.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu24-8516,"",,

rayyan-210779918,"PREDICTING OF URBAN EXPANSION USING CONVOLUTIONAL LSTM NETWORK MODEL: THE CASE OF SEOUL METROPOLITAN AREA, KOREA",,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract. As urbanization progresses, many studies about the analysis and prediction of land-use change and urban sprawl have been conducted recently. As the sprawl phenomenon progresses rapidly, the urban expansion phenomenon became uncontrolled and it has affected negatively on the city's environment and transportation finally. So, it is essential to identify lands likely to be urbanized in the future because it aids in establishing land use plans and policies pre-acting the negative impact of spatially urban expansion the sprawl by determining factors affecting the urban sprawl. Previous studies based on statistical models are limited to identifying determining factors, so the prediction performance is low compared to deep learning. On the other hand, existing studies using machine learning and deep learning overlook selecting specific region-focused variables. Therefore, this study aims to analyze and predict changes in the Seoul Metropolitan Area's sprawl in Korea using the Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory Network (ConvLSTM) with factors at the city scale and neighboring factors at the local scale in the Seoul Metropolitan Area (SMA). ConvLSTM is a type of combination model: combining Recurrent Neural Network(RNN) and Convolutional Neural Network(CNN). This study showed that ConvLSTM with factors at the city and neighboring factors at the local scale predicted the urbanized land. The determinants contain population and roads ratio at the city scale, and neighboring urban lands, distance to the nearest subway stations, slope, and elevation at the local scale. The results reveal that predicted urban lands in 2020 increase over the entire region. In particular, the expected urban lands in 2020 increase by reducing farmlands in the southern part of the SMA. It is consistent with the trend of urbanized lands from 1980 to 2010. In addition, urbanization occurs in areas adjacent to Seoul due to the well-established urban infrastructure. The results of this study can be used as evidence to establish sustainable land use plans and regulations in the future.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/isprs-annals-x-4-w3-2022-113-2022,"",,
rayyan-210779994,Revolutionizing Land Cover Analysis: A Systematic Review of Geospatial Intelligence with Classification and Segmentation,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"In today’s fast-paced technological landscape, artificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing industries, with geospatial analysis standing at the forefront of this transformation. The process of land cover classification, which involves categorizing different types of land surfaces—such as forests, urban areas, water bodies, and agricultural fields—has traditionally been plagued by inconsistencies and inaccuracies. These shortcomings have led to a variety of pressing real-world issues. Misclassified land cover data can result in the inefficient allocation of resources, where critical areas may be overlooked while less urgent regions receive attention. Additionally, the failure to accurately monitor land cover changes can allow illegal activities, such as deforestation, to go unnoticed, resulting in severe environmental degradation. Similarly, unmonitored topographical changes, like unauthorized construction projects, can significantly alter landscapes without regulatory oversight, posing risks to both the environment and public safety. Unchecked forest fires, exacerbated by delayed detection due to poor land cover classification, can spread rapidly, causing widespread damage. Furthermore, inaccurate monitoring of border fences can lead to security vulnerabilities and geopolitical tensions. Collectively, these issues contribute to the escalating challenges of climate change and urbanization, highlighting the critical need for more precise and reliable land cover classification methods. In response to these challenges, our study seeks to explore the potential of advanced machine learning (ML) techniques to revolutionize land cover classification. We leverage publicly available geospatial datasets, specifically EuroSAT and DeepGlobe, which provide comprehensive satellite imagery data across various regions. The focus of our research is on two primary tasks: Image Classification and Semantic Segmentation. Image Classification involves categorizing entire satellite images into specific land cover classes, providing a broad overview of the landscape. In contrast, Semantic Segmentation is a more granular approach that labels each pixel in an image according to its land cover class, offering detailed insights into the spatial distribution of different land types. To conduct a thorough analysis, we evaluate the performance of several cutting-edge models in these tasks. For Semantic Segmentation, we employ Meta AI’s Segment Anything Model (SAM), which is recognized for its ability to segment objects within images with high precision, and the U-Net architecture, a model that has been widely used in medical image analysis and has proven effective in various segmentation tasks. For Image Classification, we use the VGG and ResNet models, both of which are highly regarded in the field of computer vision for their capacity to extract detailed features from images and classify them with high accuracy. The primary objective of our research is to assess how these models perform when applied to land cover classification tasks and to identify their strengths and weaknesses in this specific context. By analyzing their performance, we aim to provide valuable insights that can guide future research efforts and help improve the accuracy and reliability of land cover classification methods. Additionally, our study seeks to highlight new opportunities for enhancing the monitoring and management of land resources, which is crucial for addressing the environmental and urbanization challenges that the world faces today. Our research aspires to contribute to the geospatial field by offering practical recommendations for utilizing machine learning techniques to improve land cover classification. By addressing the limitations of current methods and proposing more effective solutions, we hope to support the development of tools that are capable of accurately monitoring land cover changes and responding to the complex environmental and societal challenges of our time.","",https://doi.org/10.5121/ijaia.2024.15503,"",,
rayyan-210779998,Remote Sensing Data Analysis for Urban Planning and Land Use Change,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"With the acceleration of urbanization, rational use of land resources and effective town planning and layout have become particularly important. Through its advantages of high temporal and spatial resolution, remote sensing technology provides strong data support for dynamic monitoring, precise planning and management of land use. This study thoroughly analyzed urban planning and land use changes over the past decades using remote sensing technology, revealing the advantages of remote sensing application in land resource management. The study shows that remote sensing technology can provide continuous and multi-period land use images, effectively monitor land use changes, and provide scientific basis for land use planning and dynamic adjustment. In addition, remote sensing data's high resolution and automated processing capability significantly improves the accuracy of land use type classification, providing strong support for urban planning and land management decision-making. Integrating remote sensing data with GIS, deep learning and other technologies, this paper hopes further to promote the intelligence and refinement of land use planning, and make significant contributions to achieving the goal of sustainable development.","",https://doi.org/10.62051/gwpk5m73,"",,

This chapter reviews the development of urban water infrastructure between the classical Greek period and the Roman imperial period through the lens of six Mediterranean cities, including Athens, Corinth, Syracuse and Pergamon for the Greek and Hellenistic period, and Rome, Pompeii and Herculaneum for the Roman period. It highlights the combined importance of several technologies of water collection and storage, including wells, cisterns and aqueducts, and sketches the ways in which water was distributed over the city and made accessible to the population. Innovations like the inverted siphon played a crucial role in expanding urban water networks, whereas the emergence of lead pipes facilitated the consumption of water in the private realm.

rayyan-210780084,Scenario-based Assessment of Land Use Change on Air Quality,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"In recent decades, growing urbanization and rapid land use changes have been important components of current development, affecting environmental dynamics, particularly air quality. Over 80% of city people may be exposed to levels of pollution that exceed WHO standards (WHO 2016). Previous research focused solely on the relationship between built-up space and particulate matter (PM), with no concern for future scenarios. This study explores the potential impact of land use change on air quality using a detailed scenario-based technique. The air pollutant data for 2022 was principally gathered from five distinct land uses, whereas previous years (2010 to 2021) were received from the Central Pollution Control Board. In a supervised classification technique, a Maximum Likelihood Classifier is utilized to analyze the LULC of 2010, 2016, and 2022 in Kharagpur, a rising industrial town and the fourth-largest city in West Bengal. The analysis shows a strong 20.62 percent rise in urban areas, particularly in the eastern region, from 2010 to 2022, comprising residential, commercial, and industrial zones. Between 2010 and 2022, there is an 11.23 percent loss in vegetative areas, a 9.29 percent decrease in agricultural land, and a 0.10 percent decrease in aquatic bodies. Further spatiotemporal analysis reveals that areas with low urban density had the lowest amounts of air pollution, with an overall Air Quality Index (AQI) in the ""excellent"" range (0-50). Industrial land use contributes 74.37 percent to air pollution, followed by densely populated urban regions, which have a 47.62 percent higher AQI than low-density zones. Furthermore, the vehicular corridor has a 33.49 percent higher AQI than low-density places. According to the data, the most significant pollutants leading to AQI variance are PM2.5 and PM10. A correlation study emphasizes the effect of land use changes on air quality since PM10 was followed by overall AQI is positively related to built-up areas and negatively related to vegetation and water bodies. It suggests that fast urbanization may damage air quality, but vegetation and waterbodies might improve air quality and lower AQI. Polluted air has a negative impact on human health, agricultural production, and numerous ecosystems, putting future urban growth at risk. It is therefore critical to assess future land use changes in order to predict future air quality settings and take preventive efforts to mitigate air pollution. To compare future air quality settings to a baseline, two scenarios for LULC prediction are examined: business as usual (BUA) and sustainable development (SD). These scenarios can help determine future urban development paths, as well as land use planning and policy-level action to improve air quality.

rayyan-210780157,Effects of climate and land use on water balance and water quality in selected European lakes,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Lakes, natural or artificial, are important sources of freshwater and are frequently managed to provide ecosystem services. Consequently, the water balance and water quality in lake ecosystems could be subject to different stressors associated to physical, chemical, or anthropogenic activities. Therefore, this study provides insights into the factors that influence the water balance of selected European lakes and their implications on water quality. An analysis of isotopic, chemical, and land use data using statistical and artificial intelligence models showed that climate, in particular air temperature and precipitation, played a key role in intensifying evaporation losses from lakes. Groundwater table depth and other catchment factors also had an impact on the water balance. The study also highlights that lakes at lower altitudes with shallow depths and catchments dominated by urban or crop cover were more sensitive to water balance changes. These lakes had higher evaporation-to-inflow ratios and increased levels of total nitrogen concentration in the water. However, lakes at higher elevations with deeper depths and a predominantly forested catchment area are less sensitive to changes in the water balance. These lakes, which are often of glacial origin, were characterized by lower evaporation losses and, thus, better water quality in terms of total nitrogen concentration. Overall, understanding the relationship between water balance and water quality is crucial for effective lake management and the preservation of freshwater ecosystems.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu24-3402,"",,
rayyan-210780167,Research on Emergency Response Strategy for Large-Scale Urban Power Outage Based on Machine Learning,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Cities are the centers of economic, cultural and social life. Cities are not only densely populated areas, but also places where a large amount of infrastructure, businesses and services are concentrated. However, cities also face various challenges, one of which is power outages. A large-scale urban power outage is an unexpected event that can be caused by a variety of reasons, including extreme weather, equipment failure, and vandalism. Such incidents cause many serious harms to cities and their residents, not only threatening lives, but also undermining social order, economic stability, infrastructure sustainability, environmental quality and mental health. It is of great significance to implement the emergency response strategy of large-scale urban power outage. These strategies can not only ensure the safety of residents, but also maintain the sustainability of urban infrastructure, reduce social and economic losses, improve the resilience of cities to disasters, protect the environment and resources, and increase public awareness and preparedness [1]. Therefore, city governments and relevant agencies must carefully develop and implement emergency response strategies to mitigate these hazards. Only through effective preventive and emergency measures can cities better protect residents and property and ensure social stability and sustainable development. This paper will discuss the importance of large-scale urban power outage emergency response strategies and how to use machine learning to build large-scale urban power outage emergency response strategies. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed model is verified by experiments.","",https://doi.org/10.1109/icdcece60827.2024.10549631,"",,
rayyan-210780169,Exploring the health impacts of climate change: Challenges and considerations for health services research,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"The United Nations has declared a state of climate emergency regarding the unmitigated effects of global climate change, in large part due to its impacts on human safety and well-being.1 While climate scientists have worked to develop a deeper understanding of the influence of global warming on the environment, exploration of the human health dimensions are ongoing. One particular area of growing investigation is that of climate change's impacts on health services and outcomes. Indeed, the issue has been deemed critical enough such that the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) convened a roundtable discussion with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) in 2023 on the subject of measuring climate resiliency for healthcare delivery organizations.2 Underlying the relationship between environment and health are a series of methodological questions about how best to develop assessments of these relationships for exploring health services outcomes. The National Institutes of Health have also been working with stakeholders and the scientific community to create a strategic framework upon which to evaluate climate outcomes combined with an institute-wide initiative into this field. The goal of this endeavor appears to be reducing health threats from climate change by examining how climate drivers lead to populations being exposed to new environmental factors while identifying the health outcomes of these conditions, and also addressing the socioeconomic context within which these problems occur.3 Health services researchers are, and will continue to be, playing a major role in such efforts. In this commentary, we highlight three different manifestations of global warming: extreme precipitation events, wildfires, and heat waves, as illustrative examples of the challenges they can pose for health services researchers. For each of these phenomena, we briefly review what is known about their climate links and their relationship with human health, then provide some methodologic considerations in examining their effects on health systems and outcomes. While not a comprehensive review of the myriad ways in which our changing climate is impacting our well-being, we hope this discussion provides some points for contemplation among investigators and policymakers in this growing scientific field. Perhaps the most visible manifestation of climate change for the United States has been that of extreme precipitation events, chief among them worsened hurricane and storm seasons. Rising global temperatures are elevating surface ocean temperatures, resulting in more intense and extreme precipitation events: storms have presented with higher total rainfall, more powerful winds, and more severe storm surges.4 In addition to stronger sea-based storms, climate change is also affecting inland storms through fluctuant temperatures, leading to dangerous anomalous phenomena such as off-season tornadoes, polar vortexes, and precipitation-associated flash flooding.5 These natural disasters can have significant health impacts in a variety of ways. Traumatic injuries and deaths frequently follow their physical devastation, as has recently been tragically demonstrated by the death toll of Hurricane Helene in the eastern United States, with over 220 mortalities and rising at this time of this writing.6 Yet exposure to these weather events has also been found to be associated with lingering long-term health impacts at the community level.7 For example, studies conducted in New Orleans have shown that hospital admissions for heart attacks at the Tulane Medical Center increased threefold in the decade following Hurricane Katrina.8 These were found to be accompanied by a significant rise in key risk factors for cardiovascular disease such as high blood pressure, diabetes, elevated cholesterol levels, and tobacco smoking.8 In addition, mental health crises from sustained emotional trauma, stress, difficulty accessing resources, and a host of other healthcare delivery complications can create lasting medical problems during natural disasters.9 Regrettably, such weather catastrophes are not limited to the warm weather months. Winter blizzards and colder snaps have been shown to cause a rise in cardiovascular emergencies, with lower temperatures and large-scale temperature swings being correlated to increased heart attack and stroke rates.10-13 While anomalous weather events have the potential for massive impacts across large populations (there are currently more than 126 million people in North America living in regions at risk for a major hurricane), and discrete disasters are easy to define, measuring their resultant harms can be challenging.14 Such disasters can have destructive effects on healthcare infrastructure, forcing patients to divert to other health centers or to forgo scheduled appointments. Regional registries or hospital-based medical records may thus have interrupted or missing utilization data (particularly if power outages or evacuations limit primary data collection). Additionally, regional and national medication and medical supply shortages can have ripple effects, impacting the quality of care even at distant health centers. Finally, as noted previously, it is becoming increasingly obvious that the medical sequelae of major natural disasters can persist for years, and it is unknown if they may even compound over multiple severe storm seasons. Patients often forgo necessary healthcare during disasters, and attributing elevations in adverse outcomes to the weather event can be challenging, as it involves disentangling true exposure-related effects from delayed usual presentations, impacts of delaying needed care, and the so-called ""harvesting effect."" The last of these refers to a known epidemiologic phenomenon where anticipated deaths among chronically ill individuals are displaced forward in time by natural disasters, implying that some of the acute mortality burden following such events represents an acceleration of expected fatalities rather than those directly attributable to the disaster.15 Changes in maladaptive behavior in the wake of traumatic events can also be notoriously difficult to measure in vulnerable populations, particularly when there is subsequent migration away from the site of such injuries due to loss of housing or employment. The resultant compositional change could also introduce bias in community-level estimates of outcomes, necessitating careful risk adjustment. Lastly, we wish to emphasize that extreme precipitation events are not equivalent to the concept of climate change, as seasonal high-risk environmental threats such as hurricanes predate anthropogenic global warming. Rather, they are exacerbated by man-made greenhouse gas emissions, and as such, ascribing what fraction of the health impacts from a series of disasters can be directly attributed to the broader phenomenon of climate change is an ongoing field of debate and investigation.16 Regional wildland fires have become the face of climate change for much of Western North America, and their increase in frequency and severity have been tied to global warming and resultant changes in precipitation patterns.17 Recent US Environmental Protection Agency reports demonstrate that the annual extent of land burned by wildfires in the United States has increased since the 1980s, with the 10 most severe years (by total acreage burned) occurring since 2004.18 While wildfires can directly harm individuals in close proximity and destroy local infrastructure, the main threat they pose to human health is through resultant smoke plumes that contain an extraordinary collection of hazardous air pollutants. Such plumes may contain particulate matter, ground level ozone, carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, among other dangerous airborne pollutants.19 Wildfire smoke and its component toxins can be carried for thousands of miles, impacting communities far from the site of the original fire.20 Exposure to these air pollutants has been linked to adverse health outcomes including short-term cardiovascular and respiratory events, chief among them pulmonary disease exacerbations such as asthma and reactive airway disease.21, 22 Short-term health outcomes have been measured from a variety of data sources including mortality registers, crisis line utilizations, hospital admission and billing records, emergency department visits, among other measures.23-25 Long-term impacts are harder to quantify, but associations between wildfires and poor birth outcomes and negative psychological impacts are likely to have far-reaching implications.23, 26-28 Despite this rapidly growing body of investigation, measurement of the health consequences of wildfires has been difficult, particularly in exposure definition. Health services researchers have defined wildfire exposure in a number of ways, including the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's venerable hazard mapping system (consisting of satellite imaging of smoke plumes), ground-level regulatory air pollution monitors, nonregulatory investigative monitors, and air pollution models of varying complexity.29, 30 Fire smoke plumes can behave erratically and are highly dependent on local atmospheric conditions (e.g., temperature; humidity; and presence, speed, and direction of wind).31 Thus, even communities near major wildfires may not experience high air pollution days if the wind is blowing away from their location (conversely, those downwind may be heavily impacted even if further afield from the epicenter of the disaster). In fact, a recent study from our group identified that those living 150 km or further away from wildland fire centers may suffer greater mortality risks from long-term wildfire smoke exposure.32 Concurrently, rapidly changing wind patterns can quickly shift affected areas on daily and hourly bases, making individual exposures difficult to ascertain from remote monitoring techniques. Ground-level air monitors such as PurpleAir may be more helpful in estimating residential exposures, but cannot disambiguate wildfire from background air pollution. The importance of this factor becomes magnified because wildfire smoke often contains different components from that of usual residential/occupational air pollution, as the combustion of homes and industrial buildings can introduce other hazardous chemical compounds and heavy metals into plumes.33 Thus, analyses that model the exposure as individual pollutant fractions such as airborne particulate matter may underestimate the toxicity of the smoke. Such concerns have motivated higher dimensional machine-learning based models of wildfire air pollution exposure, which may hopefully expand to include multiple pollutants and paint a more complete picture of the hazard.34 Finally, a growing dimension of wildfire exposure research is that of the impacts of personal risk mitigation strategies. It is increasingly being recognized that people living in wildfire-prone regions are aware of the health risks posed by wildfire smoke, and may alter their behavior in response.35 Such actions may include beneficial activities such as avoidance of outdoor activities, installing HEPA filters, using N95 masks when spending time in smoky areas, and using air conditioning (or conversely risky behaviors due to misconceptions of benefits such as opening windows).36, 37 Thus, health services analyses of wildland fires based on remote sensing air pollution data may again incorrectly predict individual-level exposure levels, with the highest threat to health potentially posed by poor air quality days that are not perceived as such by affected populations. This phenomenon is further complicated by large-scale evacuations or local health center shutdowns, which may introduce additional measurement error into such investigations. Most topically, there has been a dramatic increase in global surface temperatures since the industrial revolution began burning fossil fuels, manifesting around the globe in extreme heat events. The previous decade constitutes the warmest years since temperature records were first collected in the late nineteenth century.38 Concerningly, heat waves have increased in both frequency and severity, with the resultant number of people impacted by extreme temperature events rising by 125 million between 2000 and 2016 alone.39 The impacts of high heat on the human body are well documented, with exposure to extreme temperatures engaging the body's thermoregulatory systems, the prolonged strain of which can lead to heat-related crises, such as heat exhaustion and heat stroke. More insidiously, high heat can stress the autoregulatory mechanisms of the circulatory system at large, inducing cardiovascular disease exacerbations and collapse.40, 41 While aggregate heat seasons can register sizable elevations in heat-related mortality, individual heat waves can have catastrophic effects as well. A severe heat event during the 2024 Hajj in Saudi Arabia alone is thought to have resulted in 1300 deaths.42 Elderly populations are at particularly higher risk of heat injury, due to blunted heat response mechanisms, higher rates of prevalent cardiovascular disease, and lack of risk mitigation resources.24, 43 Other studies have identified that vulnerable populations (children, elders, unhoused people, and persons of lower socioeconomic status) are at increased risk of deleterious health outcomes following heat waves, especially those living with preexisting chronic disease.39, 44 Challenges facing the assessment of the health effects of heat also include both exposure and outcome definition. Much like wildfire-associated air pollution, individual-level temperature exposure can vary by street and home, due to factors such as the amount of shade, type/quality of housing, and local greenspace availability. These factors also impact the duration and timing of high temperatures. For example, the Urban Heat Island phenomenon is observed where residences near more concrete and less greenery experience higher average temperatures and heat trapping at night.45 These factors can impact the exposure of individuals where lower evening temperatures can provide relief in some locations but not others. Along these lines, extreme heat is also associated with individual risk-mitigation behaviors such as the use of air conditioning or relocation to air conditioned spaces such as cooling facilities. These features are highly variable and depend on factors such as perceived personal risk, financial means, and cognitive/social access to transportation to access cooled spaces.46, 47 Lastly, there is strong evidence to suggest that the human body acclimates to levels of heat over time—as such, relative, rather than absolute, temperature elevations during heat waves may be more informative for understanding heat stress on affected populations.48 Regarding the outcomes of extreme temperatures, the aforementioned heat dissipation mechanisms of the body can tax the circulatory system. As such, simply quantifying diagnostic codes labeled as heat illnesses (e.g., heatstroke, heat exhaustion) may not capture the full extent of other heat-associated health impacts. Indeed, over half the deaths recorded during the 1995 and 1997 Milwaukee heat waves listed cardiovascular disease as the cause.49 Furthermore, the ""harvesting effect"" is most prominently encountered in extreme temperature events, necessitating researchers to maintain long enough outcome durations to capture the true magnitude of a heat wave's mortality impacts.50 Our understanding of the health impacts of climate change is growing, with health services research carrying promise for characterizing these effects due to the wide variety of available medical data sources and methodologies. Nevertheless, challenges and considerations remain in accomplishing this task. Care must be taken to advance our precision in measuring exposures at the individual and local levels, and to develop more comprehensive definitions of health impacts. Long-term outcomes are particularly difficult to ascertain, especially when evacuations, loss of service, and delayed onset diseases must be accounted for. While outside the scope of this discussion, health services researchers can also approach future analyses from the perspectives of health systems and workforces, which are integral in understanding the full breadth of the climate crisis.51 A warming climate will ensure that these extreme weather conditions will not only continue to occur but will most likely have progressively intense impacts in the future. As wildfires, hurricanes, and dramatic temperature events become more frequent and widespread, health services researchers will increasingly encounter such manifestations of global warming both as primary exposures in their work or complicating factors in it. Thus, investigators and policymakers in the field should become more familiar with their impacts, as those unaware of these environmental determinants of health will experience unexpected challenges attributable to such events in future research and strategy.

rayyan-210780219,Special issue on responsible IS research for a better world,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"The notion that there is a moral obligation for researchers to make the world a better place is not new, yet one seldom encounters substantive research that practically espouses such a view. Noting the lack of such research, Walsham (2012) made an impassioned call to arms in a short article titled 'Are We Making the World a Better Place with Information Systems?'. Providing further evidence of the critical need for responsible research, scholars have formed a new virtual organisation named 'Responsible Research in Business and Management' (RRBM). RRBM has the avowed focus of 'inspiring, encouraging, and supporting credible and useful research in the business and management disciplines' (http://rrbm.network). In 2019, the ISJ issued a call for papers for a special issue to encourage our colleagues to contribute to making the world a better place. Following Majchrzak et al. (2016), we suggested that contributing authors should not limit their research designs and thus contributions to the scholarly community but should also consider the practical and policy implications for a wide range of practitioners (not only managers) as well as the broader social world. Finally, they could also consider the non-human world of the environment, given our focus on making the world a better place through IS research. Thirty-nine papers were submitted to the special issue and six have, after extensive revision, been accepted. They are introduced below. We suggest that there are many different ways in which responsible research can lead to a better world. Beyond the interests of individual organisations, scholars also need to consider the grander scheme of how research can make the world a better place, not only in economic terms, but also socially, personally and environmentally. Occasionally we see articles in which it is clear that the authors are pursuing an agenda that aims to contribute to 'making the world a better place'. Examples include: Zheng and Yu's (2016) study of the socialised affordances of social media in the processes of collective action, with a detailed examination of the 'Free Lunch for Children' charity in China; Tim et al.'s (2017) exploration of how the boundary-spanning competences of social media function as a digital response mechanism in natural disasters; and Díaz Andrade and Doolin's (2016) account of how Information and Communication Technologies contribute to the social inclusion of newly settled refugees. But these examples are too few and far between. Apart from articles that demonstrate the beneficial impacts of social media and IT more generally, a stream of 'critical social IS research' emerged in the 1990s focusing on the social and ethical implications of technology in organisations and society. Critical IS researchers have explored how IS that was deployed with the objective of increasing efficiency and instrumental rationality often also increased managerial or social control, surveillance and domination, with negative social consequences in organisations and society (see Howcroft & Trauth, 2005). Thus, the purpose of critical IS research has been to contribute knowledge with transformative and emancipatory potential in order to make the world a better place. Although recognised as a third research stream (Chen & Hirschheim, 2004; Orlikowski & Baroudi, 1991) that addressed practically, socially and ethically relevant questions, critical IS research has remained somewhat outside the mainstream. It is pertinent to note that the ISJ was one of a few premier journals to advance critical research by publishing a Special Issue 'Exploring the Critical Agenda in IS Research' (Cecez-Kecmanovic et al., 2008). The ISJ further published a Special Issue on 'The Dark Side of IT Use' (Tarafdar et al., 2015a; Tarafdar et al., 2015b) that examined negative phenomena associated with use of IT, phenomena that are often hard to articulate and investigate because institutions are reluctant to acknowledge their existence given their investments in IS infrastructures and IS enabled business models. Notwithstanding these attempts, it does not seem to be an exaggeration to suggest that, for most IS researchers, the notion that they can make the world a better place with IS is far from both their intellectual comfort zone and their scholarly intentions. For instance, Clarke and Davison (2020, p. 484), writing about personal data markets, suggest that 'the research published in this area commonly treats the interests of marketing corporations as objectives, whereas those of consumers are conceptualized as constraints on the interests of the corporate players, and as challenges to the corporations' business models. … Much of the empirical research undertaken in this genre comprises laboratory experiments designed to help clarify how corporations can minimize the cost of persuading consumers into trading off their privacy for a service, for convenience, or for a token amount of money'. Some scholars take this a step further and suggest that customers can be persuaded to disclose confidential and private information voluntarily (i.e. without any compensation) if the organisation is able to establish a dyadic and reciprocal relationship with the consumer. As Zimmer et al. (2010, p. 404) note, individuals have the 'inherent tendency to socially orient themselves toward another. … People are biologically wired to respond in kind to polite social advances provided those advances follow socially acceptable guidelines'. Organisations can thus leverage these inherent tendencies to solicit private information. But does research that suggests ways in which individual privacy can be undermined really help to make the world a better place? Meanwhile, research into 'green IS' often takes the view that a green image can help the corporate bottom line, yet fails to consider whether there are any net benefits for the environment (cf. Elliot & Webster, 2017). Similar concerns afflict other instances of IS research, notably in the management-employee tensions that characterise the implementation of enterprise systems, AI, data analytics, or robotic process automation systems. We are not suggesting that IS researchers should shun these topics, but we do suggest that researchers need to consider whose interests they are privileging, protecting, and harming. There are multiple valid stakeholders: organisations, employees, customers, ecosystem players, ignored customers, those negatively impacted by a company, and whole classes of individuals whose lives are made far worse by the ignorance, reallocation of resources, and misplaced attention devoted when only those stakeholders with primary transactional exchanges are considered, that can be the focus of research. Unfortunately, researchers often unconsciously succumb to the interests of the hegemonic forces (usually corporate entities) embodied in the de facto powers associated with the contexts that they investigate (Davison, 2018). Another example of a missed opportunity to make the world a better place relates to the technology-based start-ups that continue to drive entrepreneurship. McKendrick (2017) suggests that the rapid growth of this sector depends on a variety of technological factors such as: cloud services, low cost open source software, and big data analytics capabilities. In parallel, social entrepreneurship also continues to grow (Zimmer & Pearson, 2018), yet there is little evidence that the latter is a focus of IS researchers, who seem instead to be enchanted by the technology. If we are to make the world a better place, it is imperative to study both the technological drivers and the social aspects of entrepreneurship in the context of a broader ecosystem. In striving to make the world a better place, IS researchers often too easily simply criticise digital enterprises and initiatives (especially in developing countries) for their generation of unequal outcomes, exploitation of employees, provision of inadequate working conditions and engagement in a host of other unethical practices (Sandeep & Ravishankar, 2018). We suggest that this does not constitute the production of responsible research because it provides no theoretical or practical guidance for managing and understanding the many and diverse positive and negative impacts of digital transformation. The Senior Editors for this special issue are Robert Davison (Managing Editor), Andrew Hardin, Ann Majchrzak and MN Ravishankar. We extend grateful thanks to our advisory committee members: Geoff Walsham, Cynthia Beath, Niels Bjørn-Andersen, and M Lynne Markus. We also greatly appreciate the hard work done by the many Associate Editors who worked on the special issue: Alan Wang, Alex Wang, Antonio Díaz Andrade, Bernd Stahl, Christy Cheung, Dimitra Petrakaki, Felix Tan, Frank Chan, Helle Zinner Henriksen, Israr Qureshi, Jonas Hedman, Julien Malaurent, Martin Wiener, Mira Slavova, Ning Su, Rahul De, Richard Heeks, Silvia Masiero. The accepted papers represent what we believe are exemplars of responsible IS. The review and revision process helps us clarify the five criteria of high quality responsible IS research. (1) An information system should be examined which is being used for social good, or the social good value of the information system under study is given a priority. (2) Perspectives representing the full range of stakeholders are studied beyond those engaged in the immediate transactional exchange related to the system. The perspectives should include those disaffected by the system, those ignored by the system, those receiving secondary negative and positive impacts and those affected in any way such that the system's creation and introduction to a varying degree, succeeds or fails to succeed at making the world a better place. (3) Theory is developed specifically for that social goods context. The theory takes into account the compassionate needs of the multiple stakeholders involved. (4) Efforts are made to generalise and abstract the theory back to the mainstream IS literature on IS in general. While such abstraction will lose the excitement to some degree of the research, the effort will help to make clearer how the study of responsible IS is similar and yet unique from mainstream IS. Such differentiation will help to build a community of IS researchers who will eventually (in our dreams) usurp the subcommunities in the IS discipline who prefer to stay focused on narrow economic interests of firms. (5) The discussion includes IT design principles and implications for the subdiscipline of responsible IS. As a relatively immature subdiscipline, the more specific policy-based guidance we can create both for us as researchers and preferably for policymakers, the more useful will be the subdiscipline to turning the tide from world-harming IS to world-enhancing IS. The first exemplar in our special issue is by Giddens et al. (2023), a team that is comprised of two academics and a practitioner. They meet the first criterion by examining how resources affect the use of an information system designed to counter domestic sex trafficking in the USA. Meeting the second criterion, they use a qualitative approach and the conservation of resources theory as a lens to understand the different perspectives of a domestic sex trafficking app, yielding a nicely theorised set of four different types of perspectives. They meet the third criterion by depicting a theory specifically for social goods types of apps in which the heavily constrained resources that are available in social goods are narrowly distributed based one's organisation and technology capabilities. They meet the fourth criterion by generalising their theory to what they call a Resources Model of Information Technology Use that highlights four types of users based on varying levels of organisational and technology resources. Finally, they meet the fifth criterion by describing such an example of IT design principles in the context of resource constrained organisations that are introducing new information technologies as responsible IS research practices. In the second exemplar in this special issue, Nussbaumer et al. (2023) note that large scale disasters present decision makers with complex life and death decisions. They meet the first criterion of responsible IS research by examining a decision support system that is used in the context of emergency management. They meet the second criterion by considering the ethical issues central to their context, while ensuring that they take into consideration the needs of a variety of stakeholders, viz.: researchers and practitioners in public health, and particularly emergency management; the potential victims of a disaster, that is, members of the public. For the third criterion, they adapt an existing theory (ethics by design) to the context of emergency management, ensuring that the interests of a variety of stakeholders are central. Thus, the authors build on the growing body of literature on ethics and technology usage while shifting the discussion toward ethical IS design and development. With respect to the fourth and fifth criteria, the authors demonstrate how an ethics-by-design approach was applied in the development of a decision support system to support strategic level emergency management decision makers. The resulting framework guides the selection of ethical values and demonstrates practical replicable strategies for delivering ethical design that considers multiple stakeholder perspectives. Though firmly grounded in the domain of emergency management, the paper concludes with a discussion on how the ethics-by-design approach could be applied in other contexts. In the third exemplar article of this special issue, Mettler et al. (2023) observe that making the world better through ICT also implies that marginalised groups of society can benefit from and get access to digital services. The authors meet the first criterion of responsible IS research by examining how assistive technologies (AT) can be made more accessible to the people who need them (potential users, family members and caregivers): these technologies usually considerable training as well as advanced technical setup that may discourage less technically-aware or financially disadvantaged people, especially the elderly. The second criterion relates to stakeholders: the authors focus on the end users of the AT devices, and examine the benefits of a do-it-yourself (DIY) approach that democratises access to AT. As a design science project, the article does not respond to normative criteria related to theory. Instead, they demonstrate that participatory and engaged design research with a wide variety of stakeholders is beneficial for the acceptability of the product and the DIY-process. The building instructions and the code for a homecare remote monitoring systems are freely downloadable from the authors' website. The findings are of particular value in societies where elderly people neither choose to live at home with extended families who could care for them nor live in care facilities, but instead prefer to have an independent life at home. With respect to the fifth criterion, the findings are of particular relevance to the growing sub-discipline of health information systems, with a particular focus on the needs and interests of patients and their families and caregivers. In the fourth exemplar article, Ahuja et al. (2023) examine the problems associated with fragmented solutions to grand challenges, such as lack of access to education and healthcare, commonly experienced by marginalised communities. They suggest that responsible innovation (RI) is required, recognising that some digital platforms are adept at generating economic value yet also exploit and exclude certain people and thus fall short on some aspects of the 'social good' criterion for responsible IS research. The authors address the second criterion by addressing the legitimate needs (social and economic) of the full range of stakeholders, with a particular focus on marginalised groups in two distinct locations: a city in southern India, and a community of First Nations people in Canada's far North. In this respect, a salient ongoing issue within IS research and practice relates to the lack of imaginative digital solutions where marginalised populations are seen as equal stakeholders so that solutions are designed to be not only inclusive and non-exploitative but also are feasible economically and socially. Responding to the third criterion concerning theory, the authors utilise the RI framework to demonstrate how digital platforms can adopt RI dimensions of anticipation, reflexivity, inclusion, and responsiveness to address the needs of marginalised populations in India and Canada. The RI framework has been criticised for being abstract and difficult to operationalise. The authors address this issue by demonstrating the operationalization of the RI dimensions within platforms and their ecosystems in our case studies. This then addresses the fourth criterion, as other IS researchers will be able to learn from this operationalization of the RI framework. Finally, addressing the fifth criterion, the authors consider how their study will be of value to practitioners engaged in social innovation, economic development and other services for marginalised communities. The emphasis on responsible innovation that empowers marginalised people, whether in a developing country of the Global South or in a remote area of the Global North, is clear. The authors suggest that their insights from two cases are of value to policy makers who seek to deploy platforms in remote or rural areas in the context of post-COVID recovery, with positive economic, social and environmental impacts. In the fifth exemplar of responsible IS research, Ramadani et al. (2023) dwell on the long-standing question of whether centralised or decentralised strategies are more suitable when attempting to address a developing nation's societal or economic challenges through ICT. They respond to the first criterion for responsible IS research by focusing on the social good associated with health IS in Indonesia. With respect to the second criterion, their inclusion of the local community as a stakeholder, in addition to officials at the supranational and national level, is critical. The third criterion relates to the theoretical perspective adopted. The authors conceptualise ICT-enabled development as a multi-level social process and adapt Coleman's (1990) 'bathtub' model to empirically investigate the interplay of centralization and decentralisation as the two macro-level strategies, as well as how two polar cases at the micro-level link such strategies to their own local actions. The relevance of the study for IS in general (criterion 4) relates to the centralization-decentralisation dichotomy: centralization alters the configuration of local ICT resources and imposes new local rules, while decentralisation complements centralization by enabling local communities to better comply with new local rules, develop local human capital, pursue decentralised ICT initiatives, and, eventually, address local health objectives, which then helped actualize national development objectives. The authors then address criterion 5 by reflecting on the design principles implicit in their study, noting the complementarity of centralisation and decentralisation strategies, and explaining the value of local experimentation. By investigating ICT-enabled national development as a multilevel social process, the study demonstrates that micro-level actors are agents of change capable of autonomously adapting to either strategy offered (e.g., decentralisation) or imposed on (e.g., centralization) them. In the sixth exemplar article, Senyo et al. (2023) observe that while an increasing number of studies have examined the impact of financial technology (FinTech), the issue of how FinTech supports economic empowerment for informal business, which is identified as the 'social good' context for the first criterion of responsible IS research, is relatively neglected. The authors selected the mobile money context of Ghana for the study, noting that some 88% of the Ghana workforce is in the informal sector. Regarding the second criterion, the authors collected data from four distinct groups of stakeholders, reflecting a variety of perspectives: the national bank as regulator; two mobile network operators who provide mobile money services; eight FinTech firms which develop mobile money applications; and fifteen informal business owners, who need mobile money to run their digital business activities. With regard to the third criterion for responsible IS research, the authors draw on institutional logics and a case study of mobile money to develop a theoretical model of mobile-money driven economic empowerment that is of particular value to often-neglected people at the bottom of the economic pyramid as it will help them to create and run informal businesses. The model considers the dynamics that play out between logics, actors and mobile money across three dimensions: regulatory, payments infrastructure and the informal economy. Although the model is developed based on the Ghanaian context, it is applicable to the informal sector and economic empowerment more generally and thus is relevant for other subdisciplines in IS, but particularly the Information and Communication Technologies for Development space, addressing criterion 4. It is also relevant to the sustainable development goals (1, 8 and 9) of the United Nations. Finally, the authors elaborate design principles from their case, noting that the mobile money applications were originally developed for individual consumer use, but ended up being of significant value to the informal business sector as well. We created this special issue not for researchers, but primarily for reviewers in the field of IS. The conduct of responsible IS is not as simple as the study of the economic value of a marketing campaign as is increasingly published in our flagship IS journals. Nor is responsible IS simply the conduct of an open-ended grounded research effort of the implementation of new technology, with little prior expectations or biases. Instead, the subdiscipline of responsible IS consists of researchers with very clear theoretical and ethical objectives: to increase the possibility that IS does good for the world: anything less than that is a disappointment. We suggest that responsible IS represents a new paradigm for IS research: one in which traditional evaluation criteria that prioritise large N, generalizability, and simple scientific validity and reliability assessments do not apply. Instead, reviewers for responsible IS papers should prioritise and encourage the multi-perspective data collection, conflicting objectives, messiness of stakeholder roles, and needs of the underserved that are endemic to such research. What should set a greatly constructed responsible IS paper apart is that it helps to clarify the nature of the problem that is being addressed. It should help to describe ways in which IS is helping the world to be better, and it should serve as inspiration to other researchers to jump into the messiness of such a research domain. Let us worry less about whether a data point has been collected well, and worry more about whether we are contributing to a better future for generations to come.","",https://doi.org/10.1111/isj.12405,"",,
rayyan-210780243,Special issue on responsible IS research for a better world,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"The notion that there is a moral obligation for researchers to make the world a better place is not new, yet one seldom encounters substantive research that practically espouses such a view. Noting the lack of such research, Walsham (2012) made an impassioned call to arms in a short article titled 'Are We Making the World a Better Place with Information Systems?'. Providing further evidence of the critical need for responsible research, scholars have formed a new virtual organisation named 'Responsible Research in Business and Management' (RRBM). RRBM has the avowed focus of 'inspiring, encouraging, and supporting credible and useful research in the business and management disciplines' (http://rrbm.network). In 2019, the ISJ issued a call for papers for a special issue to encourage our colleagues to contribute to making the world a better place. Following Majchrzak et al. (2016), we suggested that contributing authors should not limit their research designs and thus contributions to the scholarly community but should also consider the practical and policy implications for a wide range of practitioners (not only managers) as well as the broader social world. Finally, they could also consider the non-human world of the environment, given our focus on making the world a better place through IS research. Thirty-nine papers were submitted to the special issue and six have, after extensive revision, been accepted. They are introduced below. We suggest that there are many different ways in which responsible research can lead to a better world. Beyond the interests of individual organisations, scholars also need to consider the grander scheme of how research can make the world a better place, not only in economic terms, but also socially, personally and environmentally. Occasionally we see articles in which it is clear that the authors are pursuing an agenda that aims to contribute to 'making the world a better place'. Examples include: Zheng and Yu's (2016) study of the socialised affordances of social media in the processes of collective action, with a detailed examination of the 'Free Lunch for Children' charity in China; Tim et al.'s (2017) exploration of how the boundary-spanning competences of social media function as a digital response mechanism in natural disasters; and Díaz Andrade and Doolin's (2016) account of how Information and Communication Technologies contribute to the social inclusion of newly settled refugees. But these examples are too few and far between. Apart from articles that demonstrate the beneficial impacts of social media and IT more generally, a stream of 'critical social IS research' emerged in the 1990s focusing on the social and ethical implications of technology in organisations and society. Critical IS researchers have explored how IS that was deployed with the objective of increasing efficiency and instrumental rationality often also increased managerial or social control, surveillance and domination, with negative social consequences in organisations and society (see Howcroft & Trauth, 2005). Thus, the purpose of critical IS research has been to contribute knowledge with transformative and emancipatory potential in order to make the world a better place. Although recognised as a third research stream (Chen & Hirschheim, 2004; Orlikowski & Baroudi, 1991) that addressed practically, socially and ethically relevant questions, critical IS research has remained somewhat outside the mainstream. It is pertinent to note that the ISJ was one of a few premier journals to advance critical research by publishing a Special Issue 'Exploring the Critical Agenda in IS Research' (Cecez-Kecmanovic et al., 2008). The ISJ further published a Special Issue on 'The Dark Side of IT Use' (Tarafdar et al., 2015a; Tarafdar et al., 2015b) that examined negative phenomena associated with use of IT, phenomena that are often hard to articulate and investigate because institutions are reluctant to acknowledge their existence given their investments in IS infrastructures and IS enabled business models. Notwithstanding these attempts, it does not seem to be an exaggeration to suggest that, for most IS researchers, the notion that they can make the world a better place with IS is far from both their intellectual comfort zone and their scholarly intentions. For instance, Clarke and Davison (2020, p. 484), writing about personal data markets, suggest that 'the research published in this area commonly treats the interests of marketing corporations as objectives, whereas those of consumers are conceptualized as constraints on the interests of the corporate players, and as challenges to the corporations' business models. … Much of the empirical research undertaken in this genre comprises laboratory experiments designed to help clarify how corporations can minimize the cost of persuading consumers into trading off their privacy for a service, for convenience, or for a token amount of money'. Some scholars take this a step further and suggest that customers can be persuaded to disclose confidential and private information voluntarily (i.e. without any compensation) if the organisation is able to establish a dyadic and reciprocal relationship with the consumer. As Zimmer et al. (2010, p. 404) note, individuals have the 'inherent tendency to socially orient themselves toward another. … People are biologically wired to respond in kind to polite social advances provided those advances follow socially acceptable guidelines'. Organisations can thus leverage these inherent tendencies to solicit private information. But does research that suggests ways in which individual privacy can be undermined really help to make the world a better place? Meanwhile, research into 'green IS' often takes the view that a green image can help the corporate bottom line, yet fails to consider whether there are any net benefits for the environment (cf. Elliot & Webster, 2017). Similar concerns afflict other instances of IS research, notably in the management-employee tensions that characterise the implementation of enterprise systems, AI, data analytics, or robotic process automation systems. We are not suggesting that IS researchers should shun these topics, but we do suggest that researchers need to consider whose interests they are privileging, protecting, and harming. There are multiple valid stakeholders: organisations, employees, customers, ecosystem players, ignored customers, those negatively impacted by a company, and whole classes of individuals whose lives are made far worse by the ignorance, reallocation of resources, and misplaced attention devoted when only those stakeholders with primary transactional exchanges are considered, that can be the focus of research. Unfortunately, researchers often unconsciously succumb to the interests of the hegemonic forces (usually corporate entities) embodied in the de facto powers associated with the contexts that they investigate (Davison, 2018). Another example of a missed opportunity to make the world a better place relates to the technology-based start-ups that continue to drive entrepreneurship. McKendrick (2017) suggests that the rapid growth of this sector depends on a variety of technological factors such as: cloud services, low cost open source software, and big data analytics capabilities. In parallel, social entrepreneurship also continues to grow (Zimmer & Pearson, 2018), yet there is little evidence that the latter is a focus of IS researchers, who seem instead to be enchanted by the technology. If we are to make the world a better place, it is imperative to study both the technological drivers and the social aspects of entrepreneurship in the context of a broader ecosystem. In striving to make the world a better place, IS researchers often too easily simply criticise digital enterprises and initiatives (especially in developing countries) for their generation of unequal outcomes, exploitation of employees, provision of inadequate working conditions and engagement in a host of other unethical practices (Sandeep & Ravishankar, 2018). We suggest that this does not constitute the production of responsible research because it provides no theoretical or practical guidance for managing and understanding the many and diverse positive and negative impacts of digital transformation. The Senior Editors for this special issue are Robert Davison (Managing Editor), Andrew Hardin, Ann Majchrzak and MN Ravishankar. We extend grateful thanks to our advisory committee members: Geoff Walsham, Cynthia Beath, Niels Bjørn-Andersen, and M Lynne Markus. We also greatly appreciate the hard work done by the many Associate Editors who worked on the special issue: Alan Wang, Alex Wang, Antonio Díaz Andrade, Bernd Stahl, Christy Cheung, Dimitra Petrakaki, Felix Tan, Frank Chan, Helle Zinner Henriksen, Israr Qureshi, Jonas Hedman, Julien Malaurent, Martin Wiener, Mira Slavova, Ning Su, Rahul De, Richard Heeks, Silvia Masiero. The accepted papers represent what we believe are exemplars of responsible IS. The review and revision process helps us clarify the five criteria of high quality responsible IS research. (1) An information system should be examined which is being used for social good, or the social good value of the information system under study is given a priority. (2) Perspectives representing the full range of stakeholders are studied beyond those engaged in the immediate transactional exchange related to the system. The perspectives should include those disaffected by the system, those ignored by the system, those receiving secondary negative and positive impacts and those affected in any way such that the system's creation and introduction to a varying degree, succeeds or fails to succeed at making the world a better place. (3) Theory is developed specifically for that social goods context. The theory takes into account the compassionate needs of the multiple stakeholders involved. (4) Efforts are made to generalise and abstract the theory back to the mainstream IS literature on IS in general. While such abstraction will lose the excitement to some degree of the research, the effort will help to make clearer how the study of responsible IS is similar and yet unique from mainstream IS. Such differentiation will help to build a community of IS researchers who will eventually (in our dreams) usurp the subcommunities in the IS discipline who prefer to stay focused on narrow economic interests of firms. (5) The discussion includes IT design principles and implications for the subdiscipline of responsible IS. As a relatively immature subdiscipline, the more specific policy-based guidance we can create both for us as researchers and preferably for policymakers, the more useful will be the subdiscipline to turning the tide from world-harming IS to world-enhancing IS. The first exemplar in our special issue is by Giddens et al. (2023), a team that is comprised of two academics and a practitioner. They meet the first criterion by examining how resources affect the use of an information system designed to counter domestic sex trafficking in the USA. Meeting the second criterion, they use a qualitative approach and the conservation of resources theory as a lens to understand the different perspectives of a domestic sex trafficking app, yielding a nicely theorised set of four different types of perspectives. They meet the third criterion by depicting a theory specifically for social goods types of apps in which the heavily constrained resources that are available in social goods are narrowly distributed based one's organisation and technology capabilities. They meet the fourth criterion by generalising their theory to what they call a Resources Model of Information Technology Use that highlights four types of users based on varying levels of organisational and technology resources. Finally, they meet the fifth criterion by describing such an example of IT design principles in the context of resource constrained organisations that are introducing new information technologies as responsible IS research practices. In the second exemplar in this special issue, Nussbaumer et al. (2023) note that large scale disasters present decision makers with complex life and death decisions. They meet the first criterion of responsible IS research by examining a decision support system that is used in the context of emergency management. They meet the second criterion by considering the ethical issues central to their context, while ensuring that they take into consideration the needs of a variety of stakeholders, viz.: researchers and practitioners in public health, and particularly emergency management; the potential victims of a disaster, that is, members of the public. For the third criterion, they adapt an existing theory (ethics by design) to the context of emergency management, ensuring that the interests of a variety of stakeholders are central. Thus, the authors build on the growing body of literature on ethics and technology usage while shifting the discussion toward ethical IS design and development. With respect to the fourth and fifth criteria, the authors demonstrate how an ethics-by-design approach was applied in the development of a decision support system to support strategic level emergency management decision makers. The resulting framework guides the selection of ethical values and demonstrates practical replicable strategies for delivering ethical design that considers multiple stakeholder perspectives. Though firmly grounded in the domain of emergency management, the paper concludes with a discussion on how the ethics-by-design approach could be applied in other contexts. In the third exemplar article of this special issue, Mettler et al. (2023) observe that making the world better through ICT also implies that marginalised groups of society can benefit from and get access to digital services. The authors meet the first criterion of responsible IS research by examining how assistive technologies (AT) can be made more accessible to the people who need them (potential users, family members and caregivers): these technologies usually considerable training as well as advanced technical setup that may discourage less technically-aware or financially disadvantaged people, especially the elderly. The second criterion relates to stakeholders: the authors focus on the end users of the AT devices, and examine the benefits of a do-it-yourself (DIY) approach that democratises access to AT. As a design science project, the article does not respond to normative criteria related to theory. Instead, they demonstrate that participatory and engaged design research with a wide variety of stakeholders is beneficial for the acceptability of the product and the DIY-process. The building instructions and the code for a homecare remote monitoring systems are freely downloadable from the authors' website. The findings are of particular value in societies where elderly people neither choose to live at home with extended families who could care for them nor live in care facilities, but instead prefer to have an independent life at home. With respect to the fifth criterion, the findings are of particular relevance to the growing sub-discipline of health information systems, with a particular focus on the needs and interests of patients and their families and caregivers. In the fourth exemplar article, Ahuja et al. (2023) examine the problems associated with fragmented solutions to grand challenges, such as lack of access to education and healthcare, commonly experienced by marginalised communities. They suggest that responsible innovation (RI) is required, recognising that some digital platforms are adept at generating economic value yet also exploit and exclude certain people and thus fall short on some aspects of the 'social good' criterion for responsible IS research. The authors address the second criterion by addressing the legitimate needs (social and economic) of the full range of stakeholders, with a particular focus on marginalised groups in two distinct locations: a city in southern India, and a community of First Nations people in Canada's far North. In this respect, a salient ongoing issue within IS research and practice relates to the lack of imaginative digital solutions where marginalised populations are seen as equal stakeholders so that solutions are designed to be not only inclusive and non-exploitative but also are feasible economically and socially. Responding to the third criterion concerning theory, the authors utilise the RI framework to demonstrate how digital platforms can adopt RI dimensions of anticipation, reflexivity, inclusion, and responsiveness to address the needs of marginalised populations in India and Canada. The RI framework has been criticised for being abstract and difficult to operationalise. The authors address this issue by demonstrating the operationalization of the RI dimensions within platforms and their ecosystems in our case studies. This then addresses the fourth criterion, as other IS researchers will be able to learn from this operationalization of the RI framework. Finally, addressing the fifth criterion, the authors consider how their study will be of value to practitioners engaged in social innovation, economic development and other services for marginalised communities. The emphasis on responsible innovation that empowers marginalised people, whether in a developing country of the Global South or in a remote area of the Global North, is clear. The authors suggest that their insights from two cases are of value to policy makers who seek to deploy platforms in remote or rural areas in the context of post-COVID recovery, with positive economic, social and environmental impacts. In the fifth exemplar of responsible IS research, Ramadani et al. (2023) dwell on the long-standing question of whether centralised or decentralised strategies are more suitable when attempting to address a developing nation's societal or economic challenges through ICT. They respond to the first criterion for responsible IS research by focusing on the social good associated with health IS in Indonesia. With respect to the second criterion, their inclusion of the local community as a stakeholder, in addition to officials at the supranational and national level, is critical. The third criterion relates to the theoretical perspective adopted. The authors conceptualise ICT-enabled development as a multi-level social process and adapt Coleman's (1990) 'bathtub' model to empirically investigate the interplay of centralization and decentralisation as the two macro-level strategies, as well as how two polar cases at the micro-level link such strategies to their own local actions. The relevance of the study for IS in general (criterion 4) relates to the centralization-decentralisation dichotomy: centralization alters the configuration of local ICT resources and imposes new local rules, while decentralisation complements centralization by enabling local communities to better comply with new local rules, develop local human capital, pursue decentralised ICT initiatives, and, eventually, address local health objectives, which then helped actualize national development objectives. The authors then address criterion 5 by reflecting on the design principles implicit in their study, noting the complementarity of centralisation and decentralisation strategies, and explaining the value of local experimentation. By investigating ICT-enabled national development as a multilevel social process, the study demonstrates that micro-level actors are agents of change capable of autonomously adapting to either strategy offered (e.g., decentralisation) or imposed on (e.g., centralization) them. In the sixth exemplar article, Senyo et al. (2023) observe that while an increasing number of studies have examined the impact of financial technology (FinTech), the issue of how FinTech supports economic empowerment for informal business, which is identified as the 'social good' context for the first criterion of responsible IS research, is relatively neglected. The authors selected the mobile money context of Ghana for the study, noting that some 88% of the Ghana workforce is in the informal sector. Regarding the second criterion, the authors collected data from four distinct groups of stakeholders, reflecting a variety of perspectives: the national bank as regulator; two mobile network operators who provide mobile money services; eight FinTech firms which develop mobile money applications; and fifteen informal business owners, who need mobile money to run their digital business activities. With regard to the third criterion for responsible IS research, the authors draw on institutional logics and a case study of mobile money to develop a theoretical model of mobile-money driven economic empowerment that is of particular value to often-neglected people at the bottom of the economic pyramid as it will help them to create and run informal businesses. The model considers the dynamics that play out between logics, actors and mobile money across three dimensions: regulatory, payments infrastructure and the informal economy. Although the model is developed based on the Ghanaian context, it is applicable to the informal sector and economic empowerment more generally and thus is relevant for other subdisciplines in IS, but particularly the Information and Communication Technologies for Development space, addressing criterion 4. It is also relevant to the sustainable development goals (1, 8 and 9) of the United Nations. Finally, the authors elaborate design principles from their case, noting that the mobile money applications were originally developed for individual consumer use, but ended up being of significant value to the informal business sector as well. We created this special issue not for researchers, but primarily for reviewers in the field of IS. The conduct of responsible IS is not as simple as the study of the economic value of a marketing campaign as is increasingly published in our flagship IS journals.

rayyan-210780384,Green Urban Equity: Analyzing the 3-30-300 Rule in UK Cities and Its Socioeconomic Implications,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Green spaces in cities have been demonstrated to offer multiple benefits to their inhabitants, including cleaner air, shade in sunny periods, and a place that contributes to mental well-being. In addition, trees in cities are home to several species of animals and work as a nature-based solution that can sequester CO2 and regulate water storage in urban ecosystems. The 3-30-300 rule space rule has been suggested as a strategy for city planners regarding urban forestry. This rule states that every resident&amp;#8217;s home or workplace should be close to at least three trees, every neighbourhood should have a 30% canopy cover, and every citizen should have access to a public green space within a 300 m radius. Following this rule guarantees that all citizens obtain all the benefits of urban vegetation; however, this is not the case for all areas, particularly those impoverished ones where access to green spaces is limited, further contributing to social inequality. This study delves into the implementation of this rule across major UK urban areas, employing a blend of remotely sensed imagery, census data, ordnance surveys and machine learning methods. Our findings offer vital insights for city planners, emphasizing the need for a strategic approach to urban green space distribution that fosters social equity and environmental sustainability.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu24-20833,"",,

Following disruptions by a global pandemic and other changes, environmental scientists, engineers and health professionals have continued to engage topics that matter to people and the planet through innovation, collaboration, and translation. Earlier this year at the sixth United Nations Environment Assembly, the triple planetary crisis of climate change, biodiversity loss, and pollution received particular focus (https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/press-release/un-environment-assembly-advances-collaborative-action-triple). These shared threats to our common home require effective, efficient and equitable interventions by governments, industry, and human activities. Herein, the creative contributions by our community will remain essential in the coming years. As we continue to advance the science and improve the practice for public health, biodiversity, and ecosystem services, we must remain resilient in the face of regional and global changes.Once again, the team of editors at Environmental Science& Technology Letters (ES&T Letters) are excited to announce the winners of the best papers award from those manuscripts published in the journal during 2023. We are immensely grateful to have this important opportunity to reflect on ES&T Letters publications from last year and to recognize the quality of manuscripts from so many diverse topics contributed by members of the environmental science, engineering, and health communities, who are performing essential research around the world. The contributions of so many authors and reviewers during 2023 underscore the resiliency of our community, including topics that are directly engaging the triple planetary crisis of climate change, biodiversity loss, and pollution.To make these selections, we ask our Editorial Advisory Board members to nominate manuscripts based on the quality of work, particularly as these contributions align with our aim to facilitate communication of timely and important findings. These nominations are then ranked by our team of editors to identify the winners. Please join us in warmly congratulating these particularly exceptional ES&T Letters papers from 2023.Best Letter ArticlesClick to copy section linkSection link copied!Biofilm Formation Influences the Wettability and Settling of MicroplasticsPete, A.J.; Brahana, P.J.; Bello, M.; Benton, M.G.; Bharti, B. https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.estlett.2c00728Harnessing Semi-Supervised Machine Learning to Automatically Predict Bioactivities of Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFASs)Kwon, H.; Ali, Z.A.; Wong, B.M. https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.estlett.2c00530Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances in Canadian Fast Food PackagingSchwartz-Narbonne, H; Xia, C.J.; Shalin, A; Whitehead, H.D.; Yang, D.W.; Peaslee, G.F.; Wang, Z.Y.; Wu, Y.; Peng, H.; Blum, A.; Venier, M.; Diamond, M.L. https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.estlett.2c00926Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances in Toilet Paper and the Impact on Wastewater SystemsThompson, J.T.; Chen, B.T.; Bowden, J.A.;Townsend, T.G. https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.estlett.3c00094Sunlight-Induced Transformation of Tire Rubber Antioxidant N-(1,3-Dimethylbutyl)-N′-phenyl-p-phenylenediamine (6PPD) to 6PPD-Quinone in WaterZhou, Y.J.; Yixi, L.; Kong, Q.Q.; Peng, J.L.; Pan, Y.H.; Qiu, J.L.; Yang, X. https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.estlett.3c00499Best Review ArticlesClick to copy section linkSection link copied!Environmental Occurrence and Toxicity of 6PPD Quinone, an Emerging Tire Rubber-Derived Chemical: A ReviewBenis, K.Z.; Behnami, A.; Minaei, S.; Brinkmann, M.; McPhedran, K.N.; Soltan, J. https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.estlett.3c00521Indoor Air Quality in Urban India: Current Status, Research Gap, and the Way ForwardThakur, A.K.; Patel, S. https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.estlett.3c00636The first of our Best Paper Awards is by Amber et al., who investigated how biofilm formation on microplastics influences vertical sinking and floating dynamics. The authors tested the hypothesis that biofilm formation leads to sinking, but revealed that biofilms produced by specific species of microorganisms (e.g., Alcanivorak borkumensis) incorporate highly active biosurfactants, which lead to vertical downward transport of microplastics. However, biofilms produced by other microorganisms without this feature did not sink (e.g., Anabaena sp.; Synechococcus elongatus). The research contributes to understanding transport and fate dynamics by highlighting that the formation and the properties of biofilms appear to govern sinking or floating of plastics in aquatic systems.In 2023, ES&T Letters continued to publish a number of timely contributions on environment and health implications and management of PFAS. Three of the year's Best Papers winners focused on PFAS chemistry, environmental exposure and environmental fate and transport. In ""Harnessing Semi-Supervised Machine Learning to Automatically Predict Bioactivities of Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFASs),"" Kwon and colleagues developed a semi-supervised quantitative-structure activity relationship (QSAR) model to address the need for efficient PFAS bioactivity assessment. Designed to overcome the limitations of costly and time-consuming traditional testing, this model classifies bioactive PFAS and identifies key substructures. It was validated through structural alerts and molecular docking, which thus provided a useful tool for prioritizing assessment across various PFAS compounds. We rely on food for survival, and packaged food products are increasingly consumed in many regions around the world. In the second Best Paper Award from 2023 that studied PFAS, Schwartz-Narbonne et al. identified PFAS compounds in 42 different Canadian fast food packaging. Interestingly, these findings reported that 45% of packing contained trace levels of fluorine (F), with the highest concentrations of total F detected in four samples of molded fiber-based bowls. Such ""compostable"" bowls contain higher levels of PFAS to render them water resistant, but are marketed as ""green"" alternatives to plastic bowls. Thus, such observations contribute to ""green washing"" in the market place, and represents a regrettable substitution of plant-fiber based materials for single-use plastic food packaging. Thompson et al. reported on the PFAS levels present in wastewater originating from used toilet paper. This unanticipated source of PFAS arises from use as a wetting agent in the pulping process. The authors confirmed toilet paper as a potentially major source of PFAS entering wastewater treatment systems from four world regions (Africa, North America, South and Central America and Western Europe). 6:2 Fluorotelomer phosphate diester (6:2 diPAP) was the most prevalent PFAS detected in eight wastewater treatment plants in Florida, USA, and toilet paper usage could potentially contribute between 6.4 to 80 μg/person-year of 6:2 diPAP to wastewater–water systems.Our final Letter Best Paper winner, Zhou et al., reported on the photolysis of the tire rubber antioxidant contaminant 6PPD (N-(1,3-dimethylbutyl)-N'-phenyl-p-phenylenediamine) to form the degradation product 6PPD-Q (6PPD-quinone), which can elicit surprisingly high aquatic toxicity, under simulated sunlight irradiation. The transformation mechanism started with photoexcitation of 6PPD to the triplet stated followed by hydroxylation of the ring, and then formation of the 6PPD-Q, with an overall yield of 1%. The work provided evidence that sunlight-induced transformation of 6PPD could be an additional pathway to introduction of 6PPD-Q in aquatic environments.In our Best Review paper category, we selected two winners from 2023. Benis et al. summarized knowledge on the environmental chemistry and toxicity of 6PPD-Q. Highlighted in 2021 due to its presence in stormwater runoff and corresponding lethality to Coho salmon, research on 6-PPDQ has since advanced quickly, and this review highlights emerging knowledge regarding its broader risks to human health and the environment. This unique resource has likely been helpful to scientists and policy makers alike, and serves as a good reminder that we should always consider transformation products in the assessments of new and existing synthetic chemicals.Recent trends indicate that individuals are spending more time indoors than outdoors, a phenomenon also observed in developing countries such as India. In our final Best Review paper by Thakur et al., the authors compare existing knowledge regarding Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) measurements, modeling, and mitigation strategies between developed countries and India. The findings underscore the insufficient resources allocated to IAQ research in India, highlighting the need to accelerate research efforts in both IAQ and ambient air pollution. Furthermore, the authors emphasize the importance of disseminating research findings and translating this knowledge into actionable guidelines to protect inhabitants from indoor air pollution. This review also supports our commitment to publish impactful papers that will accelerate environmental research to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals.As ES&T Letters continues to move from strength to strength publishing high quality and timely and impactful research in environmental science and engineering from around the world, we would like to recognize the outstanding author community submitting their best work to ES&T Letters.

rayyan-210780391,Integration of Sentinel-1A and FAO Penman-Monteith method for assessment of Evapotranspiration Dynamics using advanced Geospatial Data Analytics,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Evapotranspiration (ETo), vital for agricultural and environmental management, faces challenges from climate change and spatial variability. Accurate Land Use-specific ETo estimates are essential for sectors like agriculture, forestry, and water management. Leveraging remote sensing technology, particularly optical remote sensing, holds promise in overcoming limitations posed by scarce weather station data and cloud cover issues. The study encompasses a wide array of meteorological parameters, including Solar Radiation (SR), Temperature (T), Relative Humidity (RH), Wind Speed (WS), and Rainfall (RF), gathered from the archive of Public Works Department archives for the period 2016-2017. Employing the FAO Penman-Monteith method, we calculated reference ETo, representing ETo under standard conditions. This involved intricate steps, such as determining mean T, vapor pressure, the slope of the vapor pressure curve, psychrometric constant, net radiation, and, ultimately, ETo. To enhance our understanding, we employed Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR) to model the relationship between predictor variables (VV and VH Polarized sigma naught values from Sentinel-1A) and ETo. We generated equations for both monthly mean datasets and overall study period mean, offering insights into short-term fluctuations and long-term trends. Comparative analyses across land cover types unveiled intriguing patterns. Urban transportation areas exhibited stability, while deciduous forests and wetlands showcased temporal variations. In the ETo comparative analysis, each land cover category exhibited distinctive patterns, providing valuable insights into the dynamics of ETo. Among the land cover parameters, ETo was significantly impacted by relative humidity (RH) (70.80% to 89.89%), and temperature (T). Urban vegetated areas had stable T values (29.37&amp;#176;C), while forests showed dynamic variations in T (24.24&amp;#176;C to 28.94&amp;#176;C). The VH polarization captured a diverse range of climatic influences, resulting in a broader range of dynamic ETo values (7.38 to 10.76 mm/day) compared to the VV polarization (6.74 to 9.34 mm/day). The performance of the VH sensor varied; moderate accuracy was observed in October 2016 (R 2 = 0.50) with slight underestimation (Bias = -0.08), whereas exceptional accuracy was seen in December 2017 (R 2 = 1.00) with positive bias (0.57) and excellent agreement (KGE = 0.92). The VV sensors in October 2016 had a firm fit (R 2 = 0.55), moderate underestimation (Bias = -0.87), and December 2017 showed a good fit (R 2 = 0.57), slight overestimation (Bias = 0.44), and good agreement (KGE = 0.44). Thus, integrating machine learning and satellite imagery improves ETo accuracy for real-time monitoring in adaptive management amid climate change, showcasing sensor-specific variations. For precise estimation of ETo, future research should integrate multi-source satellite data and machine learning, which is crucial for adaptive environmental management.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu24-13406,"",,
rayyan-210780497,Improving the Generalizability of Urban Pluvial Flood Emulators by Contextualizing High-Resolution Patches,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Predicting future flood hazards in a changing climate requires adopting a stochastic framework due to the multiple sources of uncertainties (e.g., from climate change scenarios, climate models, or natural variability). This requires performing multiple flood inundation simulations which are computationally costly. Data-driven models can help overcome this issue as they can emulate urban flood maps considerably faster than traditional flood simulation models. However, their lack of generalizability to both terrain and rainfall events still limits their application. Additionally, these models face the challenge of not having sufficient training data. This led state-of-the-art models to adopt a patch-based framework, where the study area is first divided into local patches (i.e., broken into smaller terrain images) that are subsequently merged to reconstruct the whole study area prediction. The main drawback of this method is that the model is blind to the surroundings of the local patch. To overcome this bottleneck, we developed a new deep learning model that includes patches' contextual information while keeping high-resolution information of the local patch. We trained and tested the model in the city of Zurich, at spatial resolution of 1 m. The evaluation focused on 1-hour rainfall events at 5 min temporal resolution and encompassing extreme precipitation return periods from 2- to 100-year. The results show that the proposed CNN-attention model outperforms the state-of-the-art patch-based urban flood emulator. First, our model can faithfully represent flood depths for a wide range of extreme rainfall events (peak rainfall intensities ranging from 42.5 mm h-1 to 161.4 mm h-1). Second, the model's terrain generalizability was assessed in distinct urban settings, namely Luzern and Singapore. Our model accurately identifies water accumulation locations, which constitutes an improvement compared to current models. Using transfer learning, the model was successfully retrained in the new cities, requiring only a single rainfall event to adapt the model to new terrains while preserving adaptability across diverse rainfall conditions. Our results suggest that by integrating contextual terrain information with local terrain patches, our proposed model effectively generates high-resolution urban pluvial flood maps, demonstrating applicability across varied terrains and rainfall events.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu24-8102,"",,
rayyan-210780597,"Geochemical tracers reveal urban-derived contamination of groundwater and springs in Gulu city, Uganda",,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Groundwater is consumed by over 2 billion people worldwide, though it is susceptible to microbial and chemical contamination (Alley et al., 2002; Parker et al., 2010). In East Africa, as in many places, displacement from rural to urban areas increases stress on local infrastructure including water and sanitation (UNCDF, 2018). In this study, we utilise wastewater tracers to examine urban-derived inputs to groundwater under rapidly developing urban areas in Gulu District, Northern Uganda. Bulk and fluorescent dissolved organic matter (DOM), microorganisms (total coliforms and E.coli) and inorganic tracers of anthropogenic waste (NO3&amp;#8211;, SO42&amp;#8211;, Cl/Br) were characterised from boreholes (from 3&amp;#8211;76 m depth; n = 113), protected springs (n = 20) and surface water from handpump drainage pools (n = 2; Richards et al., 2023). Our results indicate that NO3&amp;#8211; was elevated in water sources in the Gulu city urban area and the Cl/Br ratio was elevated in springs, compared to concentrations in the more rural Aswa County area (p &lt; .05; both). Interestingly, human and animal waste indicators E.coli and Tryp:FA ratios (Baker, 2002) displayed no significant difference between the rural and urban settings (p &gt; .05). Some construction and maintenance-related aspects of the boreholes, as spot assessed by sanitary risk observations, did not apparently correspond to the indicators of microbial contamination. Rather, results suggest that DOM prevalence is primarily depth controlled in Gulu District. We considered the distribution of organic, inorganic and microbial analytes with regards to the potential source and fate of contaminants. As the population of many urban areas increase, this study offers valuable insights useful for water management planning.

Although the structure of the city is defined differently by various governments or smart city initiatives, themes like sustainability, connectivity, data-driven planning, and smart utility systems are prevalent. As a matter of fact, more than 50% of the world's population resides in cities or other urban areas; this percentage could rise to 70% in the future due to increased urbanization and migration of individuals seeking employment in these locations. However, this implies that in order for cities to maintain a high standard of living while being energy-efficient and environmentally benign, they must have improved infrastructure and planning. Stated differently, cities must transform into smart cities. Combining machine learning, which uses the insights gained from the data, with the Internet of Things, which collects data from sensors, makes this possible. Numerous implementations usually concentrate on one or two aspects of a smart city rather than giving the entire thing a makeover. A city might, for instance, add sensors to monitor air pollution, utility meters driven by the Internet of Things, traffic lights with sensor capabilities, or a robust public transit network.

The presence of larger trees was associated with lower overall medication sales, suggesting these trees “are more beneficial with respect to heart disease and mental health than smaller trees,” says co–first author Dengkai Chi, a PhD candidate in bioscience engineering at KU Leuven.Prior studies relating urban greenspace to health have generally relied on two-dimensional (2D) remote sensing, which depicts tree canopy cover but not the features of individual trees, such as the size of their crowns (the leaf-sprouting branches).6,7 That reliance limited the ability of those studies to characterize human exposures to trees.The authors of the new study used airborne LiDAR to distinguish trees from grass, shrubs, and other vegetation, and to characterize both canopy size and density of trees. Images, left to right: © GrB/stock.adobe.com; © Brian Scantlebury/stock.adobe.com.To improve upon the exposure assessment, Chi et al. used 3D remote sensing data generated by airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) systems.5 LiDAR reliably distinguishes trees from other types of vegetation,8 and Chi’s team used it to measure arboreal traits, such as the number of trees per hectare (also known as stem density), tree height, and crown volume. The researchers focused on 604 census tracts in Brussels and surrounding areas. Tracts had an average of 11,616 inhabitants per hectare.Medication sales data for the census tracts were obtained from the Belgian social security agency, which manages health insurance reimbursements for most of the country’s population. The team limited its analysis to medications purchased by adults who were 19–64 years of age between 2006 and 2014.The team then modeled relationships between medication sales and tree traits in single- and two-factor models. They used single-factor models to evaluate the relationship between medication sales and individual tree traits—namely, stem density or crown volume. Using two-factor models, the team evaluated how sales varied in relation to tree density, crown volume, and other traits collectively.After adjusting for socioeconomic status (which also is associated with sales of drugs for heart disease9 and mood disorders10), the researchers observed a curious result. The single-factor models showed that each unit increase in stem density and crown volume corresponded to lower medication sales. However, the two-factor model that included both stem density and crown volume showed that medication sales were, again, lower in areas with greater crown volumes but higher with greater stem densities.What might explain the discrepancy? According to Chi, the results demonstrate that large trees are associated with greater health benefits than even dense stands of smaller trees. “Large trees are more effective at reducing environmental stressors like urban heat, air pollution, and noise than smaller trees,” she says. “That makes them very important for health in urban areas.”Matilda van den Bosch, a physician with a doctorate in landscape planning currently working at the Barcelona Institute for Global Health, says medication sales are a valid proxy for disease prevalence in the population. “This is an important paper that makes the case for preserving large trees in cities,” says van den Bosch, who was not involved in the study. “Humans evolved in the natural environment, and we know that exposure to nature can activate the parasympathetic nervous system in ways that facilitate recovery from stress.”11–14Cecil Konijnendijk, a professor of urban forestry at the University of British Columbia and visiting professor at KU Leuven, agrees. “We need to be more tree-inclusive in terms of how we design and manage our cities,” says Konijnendijk, who also was not involved in the study. “People talk about large-scale planting, but we need to start by protecting what we have. This paper helps to provides the evidence for why we should do this.”Konijnendijk and van den Bosch both say there is a need to replicate the current findings with additional research using individual-level data. In future studies, Chi says she will use airborne LiDAR and hyperspectral images to quantify other arboreal traits, such as tree species diversity, in relation to human health. “We want to really explore the potential of using this kind of 3D high-resolution sensing data in our research,” she says.Raf Aerts, co–first author of the study, adds, “Ideally, we would also like to move from aggregated census-tract level data to longitudinal individual health and exposure data. A national, European, or global tree exposure cohort would be ideal to study health effects of trees in more detail.”What do such findings mean for people who live in places where green things cannot grow? Despite a dearth of relevant research in arid or polar regions, there is evidence that greenspaces introduced into such areas may have positive effects.15,16 “Several cultures have indeed adapted to nongreen habitats,” says Aerts. “However, from an evolutionary point of view, humans are a species of tropical and subtropical forest and savanna habitats. So there is an intrinsic link between humans and greenspace.”Charles W.

rayyan-210781085,Advancing terrestrial biodiversity monitoring with satellite remote sensing in the context of the Kunming-Montreal global biodiversity framework,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract Satellite remote sensing (SRS) provides huge potential for tracking progress towards conservation targets and goals, but SRS products need to be tailored towards the requirements of ecological users and policymakers. In this viewpoint article, we propose to advance SRS products with a terrestrial biodiversity focus for tracking the goals and targets of the Kunming-Montreal global biodiversity framework (GBF). Of 371 GBF biodiversity indicators, we identified 58 unique indicators for tracking the state of terrestrial biodiversity, spanning 2 goals and 8 targets. Thirty-six shared enough information to analyse their underlying workflows and spatial information products. We used the concept of Essential Biodiversity Variables (EBV) to connect spatial information products to different dimensions of biodiversity (e.g. species populations, species traits, and ecosystem structure), and then counted EBV usage across GBF goals and targets. Combined with published scores on feasibility, accuracy, and immaturity of SRS products, we identified a priority list of terrestrial SRS products representing opportunities for scientific development in the next decade. From this list, we suggest two key directions for advancing SRS products and workflows in the GBF context using current instruments and technologies. First, existing terrestrial ecosystem distributions and live cover fraction SRS products (of above-ground biomass, ecosystem fragmentation, ecosystem structural variance, fraction of vegetation cover, plant area index profile, and land cover) need to be refined using a co-design approach to achieve harmonized ecosystem taxonomies, reference states and improved thematic detail. Second, new SRS products related to plant physiology and primary productivity (e.g. leaf area index, chlorophyll content &amp; flux, foliar N/P/K content, and carbon cycle) need to be developed to better estimate plant functional traits, especially with deep learning techniques, radiative transfer models and multi-sensor frameworks. Advancements along these two routes could greatly improve the tracking of GBF target 2 (‘improve connectivity of priority terrestrial ecosystems), target 3 (‘ensure management of protected areas’), target 6 (‘control the introduction and impact of invasive alien species’), target 8 (‘minimize impact of climate change on biodiversity’), target 10 (‘increase sustainable productivity of agricultural and forested ecosystems’) and target 12 (‘increase public urban green/blue spaces’). Such improvements can have secondary benefits for other EBVs, e.g. as predictor variables for modelling species distributions and population abundances (i.e. data that are required in several GBF indicators). We hope that our viewpoint stimulates the advancement of biodiversity monitoring from space and a stronger collaboration among ecologists, SRS scientists and policy experts.","",https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.04.25.489356,"",,

Background With much of the dialogue around climate change focused on energy use, transport and the use of fossil fuels, it may be surprising to learn that global food production is considered the single biggest threat to the environment. The industries behind the global food system contribute to 60% of biodiversity loss, 60% of land conversion, 30% of climate change and more than 50% of the eutrophication of water1. One-third of all land is already used to farm crops and livestock2 – and yet food production continues to be the main cause of deforestation and other habitat loss. The global foodservice market was valued at US$2.52bn in 2021, and this is estimated to grow to US$4.43bn by 2028, showing a compound annual growth rate of 9.9% from 2021 to 20283. Business decisions relating to foodservice operations can therefore significantly impact both the environment and the economy. Tony Juniper, CBE, former Executive Director for Advocacy, WWF-UK, commented ‘Most of us might believe it's our energy or transport choices that cause the most serious environmental damage. In fact, it's our food system that creates the biggest impact’. Drastic climate action is needed from the hospitality and foodservice sector (HaFS). This said, the process of measuring and reducing scope 3 emissions is challenging as a result of data access, accuracy, availability, collection, comparability, management and associated time and resource costs4. Due to the variety of scope 3 emissions and the fact that they occur throughout all stages of the value chain, they can be difficult to define and calculate. Value chains themselves are often complex, long and not necessarily transparent; they typically involve multiple suppliers and producers. This makes it challenging to comprehensively measure the impact of individual ingredients, much less that of recipes, dishes or menus. The complexity of scope 3 emission tracking has hindered the development of evidence-based strategic climate action in the HaFS sector, despite the development of protocols and guidelines on scope 3 emission measurement and reporting5. As far back as 2009, technological innovations have been shown to yield bottom- and top-line returns for businesses, with innovation being recognised as a key enabler to achieving sustainability progress6. Food data management company Nutritics has developed an innovative new solution using AI to match food items in its system to carbon and water data points from scientific, peer-reviewed life cycle inventories (LCI) for foodservice companies. This article outlines this new technological advancement and discusses its implications for greenhouse gas emissions (GHGe), water use and food waste reporting in this sector. What is currently being measured and tracked in the sector? The link between food waste and carbon emissions is still not understood, indicating that a ‘radical, rapid change’ is needed in the foodservice sector in order to reduce carbon emissions. Voluntary initiatives have seen some success in emission, water use and food waste reduction in the sector in recent years7. WRAP set up the Courtauld Commitment in 2015, which has enabled collaborative action across the UK food chain in relation to food waste, greenhouse gas emissions (GHGe) and water stress. This has seen significant success, with a 55% reduction in food waste achieved five years ahead of schedule, while work on emissions and water stress is ongoing7. Other initiatives, such as the Zero Carbon Forum and the United Nations Global Compact, have gained traction in recent years and have provided guidance, such as roadmaps for industry progress, enabling companies to take a transparent approach to setting targets and reporting progress. Despite engagement with these initiatives, it is reported that 74% of companies are still not tracking their food waste emissions and more than 60% are not reporting their emissions along the food supply chain8. In addition to this, only 39% of all companies are reporting their scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions, and only 41% are disclosing their GHG emission targets. Out of 350 of the largest food and agriculture companies in 2021, only 7% were actively working towards reducing their scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions, and only 2% had targets to address scope 3 emissions9. Bearing in mind that scope 3 emissions can account for up to 95% of a food manufacturer's emissions4, how strategic can climate action in this sector really be? Consumer and stakeholder demand In a recent survey of 1.2m people, 64% of respondents said that climate change was an emergency, ‘presenting a clear and convincing call for decision-makers to step up on ambition’. Of these people, 59% agreed that the world should do everything necessary in response, and urgently10. Stakeholders are demanding climate action, with a UK investor coalition (managing £6tn) calling for mandatory health and sustainability standards for food companies11, suggesting that organisations that do not respond will lose market share. Consumers are also supportive of government intervention, with almost two-thirds (64%) of respondents indicating that stronger policy and regulation is required at a government level to provide guidance on how the industry should reduce food waste10. Along with large organisations, customers see themselves as the primary catalysts for change – they are playing their part and expect companies to follow suit. Globally, 85% of people have shifted their purchasing behaviour towards sustainable options in the past five years. Communicating the environmental impact of food choices is also complex; while the Green Claims Code in the UK provides a useful framework and checklist for evaluating claims, many are still subjective and open to interpretation. This said, environmentally sustainable strategies have shown a positive impact on consumer attitudes and responses12. Climate disclosures Major developments in climate reporting have been observed this year. The International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) Foundation's International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) was established in 2021 and consulted on its exposure draft standards (ISSB EDs), intended to provide a global baseline of climate-related financial disclosures13. At European level, the European Financial Reporting Advisory Group (EFRAG) consulted on its European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS), which outlined an increased scope of environmental reporting requirements under the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD)14. The CSRD is set to become an EU directive at the end of 2022, with companies meeting set criteria required to expand the scope of their environmental reporting from January 2024. While differences are observed across these climate reporting standards, emissions (scopes 1-3 and total) and climate related targets are included across all standards, at various levels. At a regional level, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) also consulted on mandatory climate reporting requirements and the UK Department of Environment, Food & Rural Affairs consulted on improved reporting of food waste by large food businesses in England in 2022. The Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI) published a briefing paper this year comparing similarities and differences across climate-related disclosures using Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) recommendations and guidance as a comparative baseline. Legislative changes and investor and customer demands are therefore driving expectations for evidence-based climate action13. A consultation for the European Framework for Sustainable Food Systems was also completed in 2022, with an aim of ‘making the transition to sustainable food systems easier’. With legislation under review and the future uncertain, one thing is clear — the HaFS sector cannot continue with business as usual. While these consultations are positive in terms of encouraging action on climate commitments, companies’ ability to report their emissions and accountability have been questioned. Technological innovation To ensure long-term viability as well as human and planetary health, companies must invest, innovate and transform the way they do business. Sustainability has been identified in numerous reports as a growing priority driver for consumers and there are high expectations from foodservice operators to show greater innovation in tackling sustainability issues. Solutions to this challenge have included developing more inventive and sustainable menus and ramping up communication on sustainability initiatives and climate progress. Informed, strategic and evidence-based action is drastically required across the HaFS and technology should be seen as an essential tool in achieving this. Reliable, end-to-end digital tracking improves processes, inventories and deliveries, and reduces carbon emissions. Nutritics, a food data specialist, has collated a database of 1.4m foods and provides high-quality reliable nutrition analysis and menu management systems to the HaFS sector. It is the first software system worldwide to be accredited with the Gold Standard for Recipe Calculation Methods by the European Food Information Resource AISBL (EuroFIR). Nutritics has leveraged this database in developing a proprietary technology, Foodprint, which intuitively and automatically matches food items to peer-reviewed Life Cycle Inventory (LCI) data points on carbon and water, with a focus on country of production. The software subsequently calculates the overall environmental impact of recipes and menu cycles. Foodprint uses the information provided by the supplier through the Nutritics portal to automatically match the 1.4m foods in the database to the most accurate, and best available data point on carbon emissions and water use. The AI matching system is based on 12 levels of data quality matches, ranging from ‘category and global level’ to ‘primary LCA data input from supplier’. This software is novel as it is instantaneous and allows the environmental impact of foodservice to be estimated across all companies in the sector, reducing the time and resources needed to do so. It is an enabler allowing food businesses to develop evidence-based climate strategies to achieve net zero. Foodprint provides foodservice operators with metrics and insights into the impact of the food they serve, from field to fork, and supports the development of environmentally-driven menu cycles. It provides food businesses with data on their dishes and menus, and streamlines communication of environmental impacts to consumers through carbon and water footprint labels and QR codes, empowering both food businesses and their customers to make informed and environmentally conscious decisions. The technology streamlines accreditation schemes from the supplier portal to digital screens and on menus, allowing food quality marks to be communicated effectively to consumers. Additional environmental impacts, such as biodiversity, land use and the conversion of environmental impacts into relatable everyday metrics (distance on a train, Google searches, boiling a kettle, etc.), can also be communicated to users through the QR code. Carbon footprint scoring This technology allows businesses to gain clarity and control over the carbon footprint of their supply chains, to automate non-financial ESG reporting and to substantiate their sustainability goals and corporate values. At the front-of-house, Foodprint's carbon display allows food businesses to add a carbon footprint score to packaging, dishes, screens and promotional materials, allowing users to understand the environmental impact of purchasing. The automated outputs and transparency enables businesses to strengthen trust in their brand and may play a key role in automating upcoming climate-related disclosures for the HaFS sector by linking research to industry. Foodprint technology enables companies to be reactive to changes within an increasingly disruptive food supply chain, and digitally enforces trust across sourcing and foodservice systems. A practice of consistently tracking and reporting on emissions facilitates strategic and evidence-based climate action in real-time and allows greater visibility of hot spots for improvement within value chains. Further research and development Two further areas that are actively being researched by Nutritics are the role of chefs in the design of sustainable and circular menus, and the impact of environmental labels on dietary choice and sales in a foodservice setting, under two European-funded projects: Climate Smart Chefs and GoGreenRoutes. The LIFE Climate Smart Chefs project aims to contribute to the development and implementation of the EU Climate Policy and the Farm to Fork (F2F) strategy by actively involving European chefs as promoters of low emission, nutritious and affordable diets that reduce environmental impacts, improve public health and tackle food waste. The project intends to provide chefs with the knowledge and tools to generate change in recipe design, menu planning and communication with customers, fostering awareness on climate and environmental issues15. Under this programme, Nutritics developed a digital tool to design climate smart menus and will train 160 chefs in the EU to input and redesign their menus to have lower environmental impacts in 2023. A qualitative analysis collating feedback from chefs and experts on the software was completed in August 2022. The GoGreenRoutes project is a multidisciplinary consortium of 40 organisations, which combines participatory approaches and citizen science with big data analyses and digital innovation to co-create ‘Urban Well-being Labs’ in six ‘Cultivating Cities’ across the EU. Under the GoGreenRoutes project, the impact of environmental labelling from the Foodprint system on consumer perception and dietary choices within multiple food environments will be evaluated in 202316. The impact of environmental labelling on consumer choice and sales data from several retail environments will be investigated across a number of universities in the EU in 2023. A food waste tracking and monitoring feature is also being integrated and trialled in Nutritics software. Food waste is tracked in the system at several levels and is converted into valuable data insights including emissions, water use and revenue loss. These data insights provide a robust baseline for climate action and shifts towards responsible sourcing and sustainable business practices, at a high multi-site level down to recipe and food level data per site. This function is being developed through a formal partnership with WRAP and will provide an additional layer of data insights to the system, strengthening the evidence base for corporate strategy and sustainability progress in the HaFS sector. Conclusions With global food production the single biggest contributor to the climate crisis, drastic action is needed from the HaFS in order to have any real impact on climate change mitigation. However, the logistics of tracking and reporting emissions – particularly scope 3 emissions – can be challenging. The smart, efficient leveraging of data is a crucial component in consistently evaluating and refining sustainability efforts. Data-driven software that enables rigorous, yet automated, reporting and analysis can allow food businesses operating in an already strained industry to make real, tangible change. Ultimately, technology drives efficiency and this is as true for the food industry's fight against climate change as it is in other areas of business. Digitisation is the key to the paradigm shift required for the mitigation of climate change, helping companies to challenge traditional schools of thought through every part of their operations: products, processes and business models.

rayyan-210781267,A Scientific Perspective on Using Artificial Intelligence in Sustainable Urban Development,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Digital transformation (or digitalization) is the process of continuous further development of digital technologies (such as smart devices, cloud services, and Big Data) that have a lasting impact on our economy and society. In this manner, digitalization is a huge driver for permanent change, even in the field of Sustainable Urban Development. In the wake of digitalization, expectations are changing, placing pressure at the societal level on the design and development of smart environments for everything that means Sustainable Urban Development. In this sense, the solution is the integration of Artificial Intelligence into Sustainable Urban Development, because technology can simplify people’s lives. The aim of this paper is to ascertain which Sustainable Urban Development dimensions are taken into account when integrating Artificial Intelligence and what results can be achieved. These questions formed the basic framework for this research article. In order to make the current state of Artificial Intelligence in Sustainable Urban Development as a snapshot visible, a systematic review of the current literature between 2012 and 2022 was conducted. The data were collected and analyzed using PRISMA. Based on the studies identified, we found a significant growth in studies, starting in 2018, and that Artificial Intelligence applications refer to the Sustainable Urban Development dimensions of environmental protection, economic development, social justice and equity, culture, and governance. The used Artificial Intelligence techniques in Sustainable Urban Development cover a broad field of Artificial Intelligence, such as Artificial Intelligence in general, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Artificial Neuronal Networks, Operations Research, Predictive Analytics, and Data Mining. However, with the integration of Artificial Intelligence in Sustainable Urban Development, challenges are marked out. These include responsible municipal policies, awareness of data quality, privacy and data security, the formation of partnerships among stakeholders (e.g., local citizens, civil society, industry, and various levels of government), and transparency and traceability in the implementation and rollout of Artificial Intelligence. A first step was taken towards providing an overview of the possible applications of Artificial Intelligence in Sustainable Urban Development. It was clearly shown that Artificial Intelligence is also gaining ground in this sector.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/bdcc7010003,"",,
rayyan-210781273,Towards an AI-driven framework for multi-scale urban flood resilience planning and design,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract Climate vulnerability is higher in coastal regions. Communities can largely reduce their hazard vulnerabilities and increase their social resilience through design and planning, which could put cities on a trajectory for long-term stability. However, the silos within the design and planning communities and the gap between research and practice have made it difficult to achieve the goal for a flood resilient environment. Therefore, this paper suggests an AI (Artificial Intelligence)-driven platform to facilitate the flood resilience design and planning. This platform, with the active engagement of local residents, experts, policy makers, and practitioners, will break the aforementioned silos and close the knowledge gaps, which ultimately increases public awareness, improves collaboration effectiveness, and achieves the best design and planning outcomes. We suggest a holistic and integrated approach, bringing multiple disciplines (architectural design, landscape architecture, urban planning, geography, and computer science), and examining the pressing resilient issues at the macro, meso, and micro scales.","",https://doi.org/10.1007/s43762-021-00011-0,"",,

However, the micro-territorial level, which encompasses a community perspective, has not been examined through a comprehensive forecasting method of sustainability categories with machine learning tools. This study aims to establish a method to forecast the sustainability levels of an urban ecosystem through supervised modeling. To this end, it was necessary to establish a set of indicators that characterize the dimensions of sustainable development, consistent with the Sustainable Development Goals. Using the data normalization technique to process the information and combining it in different dimensions made it possible to identify the sustainability level of the urban zone for each year from 2009 to 2017. The resulting information was the basis for the supervised classification. It was found that the sustainability level in the micro-territory has been improving from a low level in 2009, which increased to a medium level in the subsequent years. Forecasts of the sustainability levels of the zone were possible by using decision trees, neural networks, and support vector machines, in which 70% of the data were used to train the machine learning tools, with the remaining 30% used for validation. According to the performance metrics, decision trees outperformed the other two tools.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/su12083326,"",,
rayyan-210781284,A Neural Network-Based Sustainable Data Dissemination through Public Transportation for Smart Cities,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"In recent years, there has been a big data revolution in smart cities dues to multiple disciplines such as smart healthcare, smart transportation, and smart community. However, most services in these areas of smart cities have become data-driven, thus generating big data that require sharing, storing, processing, and analysis, which ultimately consumes massive amounts of energy. The accumulation process of these data from different areas of a smart city is a challenging issue. Therefore, researchers have started aiming at the Internet of vehicles (IoV), in which smart vehicles are equipped with computing and storage capabilities to communicate with surrounding infrastructure. In this paper, we propose a subcategory of IoV as the Internet of buses (IoB), where public buses enable a service as a data carrier in a smart city by introducing a neural network-based sustainable data dissemination system (NESUDA), where opportunistic sensing comprises delay-tolerant data collection, processing and disseminating from one place to another place around the city. The objective was to use public transport to carry data from one place to another and to reduce the traffic from traditional networks and energy consumption. An advanced neural network (NN) algorithm was applied to locate the realistic arrival time of public buses for data allocation. We used the Auckland transport (AT) buses data set from the transport agency to validate our model for the level of accuracy in predicted bus arrival time and scheduled arrival time to disseminate data using bus services. Data were uploaded onto buses as per their dwelling time at each stop and terminals within the coverage area of deployed RSU. The offloading capacity of our proposed data dissemination system showed that it could be utilized to effectively complement traditional data networks. Moreover, the maximum offloading capacity at each parent stop could reach up to 360 GB with a huge saving of energy consumption.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/su122410327,"",,

The mix of expert interview surveys and structured literature analysis is the basis to examine the status quo and innovative approaches. It enables to critically investigate limitations and human, societal and environmental impacts. This study’s findings offer orientation in navigating innovation for resilient, agile ecosystems with the dynamic ability to adapt to changing environment and to grow with the change and achieving the sustainable development goals toward preservation and upgrade of buildings instead of new construction. The key challenge for sustainable technical innovation is to exploit human and societal potential. The study allocates the lack of research in this field and inadequate education as most significant limitations and critically evaluates that a disruptive culture of thinking may enable the sustainable design of smart cities.

Heavy traffic, unexpected geohazards are some of the effects of uncontrollable development. This situation points its fingerto urban planning and design; there are numerous automation tools to help urban planners assess and forecast, yet unplanned development still occurs, impeding sustainability. Automation tools use machine learning classification models to analyze spatial data and various trend views before planning a new urban development. Although there are many sophisticated tools and massive datasets, big cities with colossal migration still witness traffic jams, pollution, and environmental degradation affecting urban dwellers' quality. This study will analyze the current predictors in urban planning machine learning models and identify the suitable predictors to support sustainable urban planning.

This research employed a neural network as an adaptive artificially-intelligent application to study the complex domains of traffic vulnerability and the resilience of the transport system in Nigerian cities (Kano and Lagos). The input criteria to train and check the models for the neural resilience network are the demographic variables, the geospatial data, traffic parameters, and infrastructure inventories. The training targets were set as congestion elements (traffic volume, saturation degree and congestion indices), which are in line with the relevant design standards obtained from the literature. A multi-layer feed-forward and back-propagation model involving input–output and curve fitting (nftool) in the MATLAB R2019b software wizard was used. Three algorithms—including Levenberg–Marquardt (LM), Bayesian Regularization (BR), and a Scaled Conjugate Gradient (SCG)—were selected for the simulation. LM converged easily with the Mean Squared Error (MSE) (2.675 × 10−3) and regression coefficient (R) (1.0) for the city of Lagos. Furthermore, the LM algorithm provided a better fit for the model training and for the overall validation of the Kano network analysis with MSE (4.424 × 10−1) and R (1.0).

This paper presents a global overview of urban data sources and structures used to train machine learning (ML) algorithms integrated into urban planning decision support systems (DSS). It contributes to a common understanding of choosing the right urban data for a given urban planning issue, i.e., their type, source and structure, for more efficient use in training ML models. For the purpose of this study, we conduct a systematic literature review (SLR) of all relevant peer-reviewed studies available in the Scopus database. More precisely, 248 papers were found to be relevant with their further analysis using a text-mining approach to determine (a) the main urban data sources used for ML modeling, (b) the most popular approaches used in relevant urban planning and urban problem-solving studies and their relationship to the type of data source used, and (c) the problems commonly encountered in their use. After classifying them, we identified the strengths and weaknesses of data sources depending on several predefined factors. We found that the data mainly come from two main categories of sources, namely (1) sensors and (2) statistical surveys, including social network data. They can be classified as (a) opportunistic or (b) non-opportunistic depending on the process of data acquisition, collection, and storage. Data sources are closely correlated with their structure and potential urban planning issues to be addressed. Almost all urban data have an indexed structure and, in particular, either attribute tables for statistical survey data and data from simple sensors (e.g., climate and pollution sensors) or vectors, mostly obtained from satellite images after large-scale spatio-temporal analysis. The paper also provides a discussion of the potential opportunities, emerging issues, and challenges that urban data sources face and should overcome to better catalyze intelligent/smart planning. This should contribute to the general understanding of the data, their sources and the challenges to be faced and overcome by those seeking data and integrating them into smart applications and urban-planning processes.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/data7120170,"",,

This significantly affects the happiness of residents around the URs, the overall image of the city, and the environment, and it has become an important issue in urban construction. At present, the types of urban ruins mainly include industrial ruins, abandoned urban buildings, and war sites. Generally, methods such as demolition and reconstruction of original buildings or upgrading and transformation are used to reuse URs, and some of them have achieved fruitful results. However, the current renovation of URs is based on fragmented renovation strategies for different URs without a systematic and universally applicable renovation methodology. With the development of artificial intelligence, technologies such as Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), Easy DL, and Natural Language Processing (NLP) can provide technical support for urban ruin reconstruction, from design to operation. Specifically in the present study, the ten representative URs in Guangzhou are first evaluated by the Analytic Hierarchy Process and then combined with AI methods, such as the adversarial generative networks and big data applications, into the reuse design of URs. Finally, a complete research system is established to implement URs’ projects, which provides a clearer systematic planning strategy for the reuse of URs in the future.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/su142214812,"",,

The availability of energy-efficient infrastructures and utilities depend on the sustainability of smart cities. The big streaming data generated and collected by smart building devices and systems contain useful information that needs to be used to make timely action and better decisions. The ultimate objective of these procedures is to enhance the city's sustainability and livability. The replacement of decades-old infrastructures, such as underground wiring, steam pipes, transportation tunnels, and high-speed Internet installation, is already a major problem for major urban regions. There are still certain regions in big cities where broadband wireless service is not available. The decision support system is recently acquiring increasing attention in the smart city context. In this article, a deep learning–based sustainable decision support system (DLSDSS) has been proposed for energy building in smart cities. This study proposes the integration of the Internet of Things into smart buildings for energy management, utilizing deep learning methods for sensor information decision making. Building a socially advanced environment aims to enhance city services and urban administration for residents in smart cities using remote sensing techniques. The proposed deep learning methods classify buildings based on energy efficiency. Data gathered from the sensor network to plan smart cities' development include a deep learning algorithm's structural assembly of data. The deep learning algorithm provides decision makers with a model for the big data stream.

rayyan-210781333,TOWARDS MORE RESILIENT SMART CITIES: MT-InSAR MONITORING OF URBAN INFRASTRUCTURE USING MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUES,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract. Global climate change makes the maintenance and resilience of cities one of the greatest challenges facing civilization. Constant monitoring is essential work to determine if the city and its infrastructure are well preserved. This monitoring has become increasingly simple and affordable, thanks to the advancement of technology, so the current trend is to systematically monitor the entire city (this concept is the paradigm of the smart city). There are several methods for infrastructure monitoring including GPS, mobile-mapping, video-surveillance, etc. However, this type of method has a series of disadvantages, such as the impossibility of obtaining large-scale data or the unavailability of information of the previous, current or after state that an event has occurred in the study-area. This can be solved with monitoring based on satellite images, since these have historical and constant coverage over time, with good resolution to identify urban structures and cover large study areas. The use of satellite radar images through MT-InSAR is booming because it is a powerful remote sensing technique capable of detecting displacements on the earth's surface. This technique can be combined with Machine-Learning to perform predictive analysis in urban environments and detect infrastructure failures. This predictive monitoring capable of anticipating risks is one of the objectives of the new urbanism. For this reason, this work analyzes the collapse of a pier, which occurred in Vigo, a city in NW Spain, through radar satellite images (Sentinel-1), MT-InSAR and Machine-Learning. The result is the possibility of anticipating structural failures thanks to the predictive monitoring.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/isprs-annals-x-4-w3-2022-221-2022,"",,

Urban morphological feature extraction and similarity analysis represents a practical framework in many studies to interpret and introduce the current built environment to aid in proposing novel designs. In conventional methods, morphological features are represented based on qualitative descriptions, symbolical interpretation, or manually selected indicators. However, these methods could cause subjective bias and limit the generalizability. This study proposes a hybrid data-driven approach to support quantitative morphological descriptions and multi-dimensional similarity analysis for urban design decision-making and to further morphology-related studies using information abundance via a deep-learning approach. We constructed a dataset of 3817 residential plots with geometrical and related infrastructure information. A deep convolutional neural network, GoogLeNet, was implemented with the plots’ figure–ground images, by quantifying the morphological features into 2048-dimensional feature vectors. We conducted a similarity analysis of the plots by calculating the Euclidean distance between the high-dimensional feature vectors. Then, a comparison study was performed by retrieving cases based on the plot shape and plots with buildings separately. The proposed method considers the overall characteristics of the urban morphology and social infrastructure situations for similarity analysis. This method is flexible and effective. The proposed framework indicates the feasibility and potential of integrating task-oriented information to introduce custom and adequate references via deep learning methods, which could support decision making and association studies on morphology with urban consequences.

Urban transformation processes, such as gentrification as well as the increase in poor urban neighbourhoods (e.g., slums) produce new urban patterns. The intersection of very rapid socio-economic and demographic dynamics are often insufficiently understood, and relevant data for understanding them are commonly unavailable, dated, or too coarse (resolution). Traditional survey-based methods (e.g., census) are carried out at low temporal granularity and do not allow for frequent updates of large urban areas. Researchers and policymakers typically work with very dated data, which do not reflect on-the-ground realities and data aggregation hide socio-economic disparities. Therefore, the potential of Earth Observations (EO) needs to be unlocked. EO data have the ability to provide information at detailed spatial and temporal scales so as to support monitoring transformations. In this paper, we showcase how recent innovations in EO and Artificial Intelligence (AI) can provide relevant, rapid information about socio-economic conditions, and in particular on poor urban neighbourhoods, when large scale and/or multi-temporal data are required, e.g., to support Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) monitoring.

Thus, there is an opportunity to apply advanced computational tools to the problem of traffic safety, in regards especially to pedestrians, who have been often overlooked in the past. This paper combines public data sources, large-scale street imagery and computer vision techniques to approach pedestrian and vehicle safety with an automated, relatively simple, and universally-applicable data-processing scheme. The steps involved in this pipeline include the adaptation and training of a Residual Convolutional Neural Network to determine a hazard index for each given urban scene, as well as an interpretability analysis based on image segmentation and class activation mapping on those same images. Combined, the outcome of this computational approach is a fine-grained map of hazard levels across a city, and an heuristic to identify interventions that might simultaneously improve pedestrian and vehicle safety.

Data-driven artificial intelligence is becoming so fundamentally ingrained in these developments that smart cities have been called artificially intelligent cities and autonomous cities. The COVID-19 pandemic has increased the physical isolation of people and consequently escalated the pace of human migration to digital and virtual spaces. This paper investigates the use of AI in urban governance as to how AI could help governments learn about urban governance parameters on various subject matters for the governments to develop better governance instruments. To this end, we develop a case study on online learning in Saudi Arabia. We discover ten urban governance parameters using unsupervised machine learning and Twitter data in Arabic. We group these ten governance parameters into four governance macro-parameters namely Strategies and Success Factors, Economic Sustainability, Accountability, and Challenges. The case study shows that the use of data-driven AI can help the government autonomously learn about public feedback and reactions on government matters, the success or failure of government programs, the challenges people are facing in adapting to the government measures, new economic, social, and other opportunities arising out of the situation, and more. The study shows that the use of AI does not have to necessarily replace humans in urban governance, rather governments can use AI, under human supervision, to monitor, learn and improve decision-making processes using continuous feedback from the public and other stakeholders. Challenges are part of life and we believe that the challenges humanity is facing during the COVID-19 pandemic will create new economic, social, and other opportunities nationally and internationally.","",https://doi.org/10.3389/frsc.2022.751681,"",,
rayyan-210781358,Assessing the effect of human activities on biophony in urban forests using an automated acoustic scene classification model,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Monitoring biodiversity and assessing the impact of human activities using acoustics is a promising area in the field of urban ecology. Previous studies on urban biodiversity using acoustics are often limited by data continuity and survey scope, making it difficult to answer questions about relationships between bird population dynamics and environmental factors. To some extent, big data methods such as continuous acoustic monitoring have bridged this gap and provided new research paths to address the problem. In this study, we proposed a machine learning (ML) method that uses convolutional neural networks (CNN) and target sound area ratios (TSAR) to quantify the dominance of seven types of acoustic scenes. Acoustic data was recorded at nine sites in three urban forests in Guangzhou, China. Using the site-related sound data, we trained the convolutional neural network and identified seven target soundscape components with an overall F1 score of 0.97, a precision of 0.96, and a recall of 0.97. Spatial patterns of acoustic scenes in urban forests were examined to understand the effective working radius of monitoring equipment and the impacts of differing land use types on the composition of soundscapes. This study indicates significant interactions between human activities and biodiversity using acoustics, demonstrates that vocal organisms respond to environmental changes primarily by changes in their vocal frequencies, and proposes a novel framework for utilizing acoustics to monitor urban biodiversity. Going forth, these analyses help to promote the conservation of biodiversity and the sustainability of urban development.","",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2022.109437,"",,

Evaluating the nature and processes of these changes is key to understanding the extent to which ecological instability may be affecting sustainability futures. This study employed integrated remote sensing, GIS, land accounting techniques and utilisation of high-resolution Quickbird and Worldview 2 images to analyse actual (2008–2017) and future (2017–2030) LCC and explored implications for ecological sustainability in the Greater Accra Metropolitan Area, Ghana. After mapping and classifying actual LCC, multi-layer perception (MLP) neural network and Markov chain were employed to predict future LCC for the year 2030. The results indicate that the built-up area increased substantially from 27% in 2008 to 46% in 2017 and is expected to rise to 73% by 2030. In contrast, open-space (10%), forestlands (5%) and grassland/farmlands (49%) decreased progressively (2008–2030). In effect, these land-cover types experienced area turnover ˃100% during the actual and predicted period, indicating high vulnerability of natural land cover to urban growth, ecological degradation and resource depletion. These findings highlight significant implications of LCC for ecological sustainability in the study area.

This study examined land use and land cover changes (LULCC) of peri-urban areas of Kinondoni Municipality in Dar es Salaam city for the period between 1999 and 2019 and predicted future changes by 2039. The specific objectives were to; (i) map the spatial-temporal land use and cover changes (ii) analyze settlements (built-up areas) patterns and factors influencing their changes (iii) predict changes that might happen for the next two decades. LULCC for 1999 to 2019 were detected through Maximum Likelihood (ML) supervised classification techniques while Cellular Automata based on Artificial Neural Network (CA-ANN) model was used to predict future changes. Over the past two decades, 33.7% of vegetation has been lost due to increased settlements, as shown by linear development pattern of built-up areas, which has gained about 30% of other land covers. This study predicts that by 2039, built-up areas will increase drastically to occupy 51.6%, while vegetation and water cover will decrease to occupy 40.4% and 1.4%, respectively. Without good planning strategies and land use policies, the control and management of the magnitude and patterns of peri-urban growth and sustainable management of natural and built environments in Tanzania will remain a challenge.

The main objectives of this article were to develop a robust artificial intelligence-based hybrid geo-simulation model to support multi-scenario urban growth modeling for urban policy improvement. In this study, earth observation datasets, Artificial Neural Network-Multilayer Perceptron coupled with Markov Chain (MLP-Markov) and Cellular Automata and Markov Chain (CA-Markov) were applied and the best performance was measured for urban growth modeling. The result shows that the urban land use was 25.79, 31.40, 45.19, 89.22 and 147.96 square km in 1971, 1981, 1991, 2001 and 2011 which has been predicted for 2021, 2031, 2041 and 2051 based on the planned and unplanned development scenarios. The predicted urban land use of the planned development scenario is 242.10, 312.69, 363.80 and 400.72 square km while 242.91, 314.31, 366.23 and 403.98 square km of the unplanned development scenario during 2021, 2031, 2041 and 2051. The uncertainty result shows that overall agreement (84.99%) and other indices are higher, and disagreement is lower (15.01%) for MLP-Markov than the CA-Markov for the urban land use prediction. The hybrid geo-simulation models were tested over multiple urban planning indicators to understand urban growth patterns and related scenarios. The result shows that the geo-simulation model is extremely sensitive to the complex pattern of urban growth and disperse indicators over space and time. This study provides a promising guideline for urban planners and conservation scientists to implement a robust artificial intelligence-based hybrid geo-simulation model for compact, organized, and integrated land use-transportation development.","",https://doi.org/10.1080/10106049.2022.2138983,"",,

To date, multiple land uses are experiencing urban construction-related land expansion, population increase, and socioeconomic development. Comprehensive evaluation and understanding of the effect of urban sprawl and its rapid LUCC are of great importance to managing land surface resources for sustainable development. The present research applied remote sensing data, such as Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper and Landsat-8 Operation Land Imager, on selected images between July and August from 1985 to 2020 with the use of multiple types of software to explore, classify, and analyze the historical and future LUCCs in Baghdad City. Three historical LUCC maps from 1985, 2000, and 2020 were created and analyzed. The result shows that urban construction land expands quickly, and agricultural land and natural vegetation have had a large loss of coverage during the last 35 years. The change analysis derived from previous land use was used as a change direction for future simulation, where natural and anthropogenic factors were selected as the drivers’ variables in the process of multilayer perceptron neural network Markov chain model. The future land use/cover change (FLUCC) modeling results from 2030 to 2050 show that agriculture is the only land use type with a massive decreasing trend from 1985 to 2050 compared with other categories. The entire change in urban sprawl derived from historical and FLUCC in each period shows that urban construction land increases the fastest between 2020 and 2030. The rapid urbanization along with unplanned urban growth and rising population migration from rural to urban is the main driver of all transformation in land use.

Based on existing datasets, the model was trained and then transferred to new datasets. The method was evaluated within three distinct urban areas: a green space, a residential area and a suburban area. The experimental results indicate that our method achieved higher performance than other Faster R-CNN models.

Notably, the urban heat island phenomenon is becoming more prominent in megacities and their hinterlands in temperate and subtropical climatic regions. In the daytime in summer, there exists a high possibility of accelerating the land surface temperature (LST) in desert cities, due to the alterations made by human beings in the natural environment. In this study, we investigate the spatial formation of LST in a tropical sub-Saharan city of Accra, a gateway to West Africa, using Landsat data in 2003 and 2017. Machine learning techniques and the different spatial and statistical methods such as tasseled cap transformation (TCT), urban-rural gradient, and multiresolution grid-based and landscape metrics were employed to examine procured land use/cover (LUC) and LST maps. LUC was classified into five categories: Built up, Green 1, Green 2, Bare land, and Water. The results of the analysis indicate that Built up, Green 2, and Bare land had caused the highest heating effect while Green 1 and Water had caused the considerable cooling effect during the daytime in Accra. The urban-rural difference in LST recorded 1.4 °C in 2003 and 0.28 °C in 2017. The mean size, mean shape, largest patch, and aggregation of Built up, Green 1, and Green 2 had a strong relationship with the mean LST. It is essential for urban planners to carefully examine the formation and effect of the urban heat island (UHI) for sustainable urban development and landscape policy toward mitigation and adaptation planning in Accra.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/su12197953,"",,

Coordination and coherence of various subsystems are critical for promoting urban-rural integration and regional synergistic development and will have a complicated impact on sustainable development in the trade-off between socioeconomic growth and environmental conservation. This paper theorized the interconnected and mutually influential coupling coordination relationship between population-land-economic urbanization (PLEU) and the mechanism by which this relationship affects urban carbon emissions. The Wavelet Neural Network (WNN), Coupling Coordination Degree model, and econometric model were used to reveal this relationship and mechanism. A total of 17 cities in Shandong Province, China, were used as study subjects for empirical examination. The results show that the level of PLEU in Shandong was significantly improved from 2007 to 2016, but the gap between cities tended to further expand. The 17 cities gradually got rid of the antagonistic disorder issue of the coupling coordination relationship of PLEU from 2007 to 2016, spatially showing the agglomeration characteristics with Qingdao and Jinan as the core, respectively. The influence of the coupling coordination degree of PLEU on urban carbon emissions presents an inverted, U-shaped characteristic, that is, the total urban carbon emissions will first increase and then decrease as the improvement of the coupling coordination relationship of PLEU. China’s new-type urbanization has provided an efficient solution to sustainable development, namely planning and designing at the highest strategic level to establish scientific goals. This new-type urbanization strategy could provide an effective alternative for other emerging countries worldwide, for addressing the challenges to sustainable development.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/land11020266,"",,

Due to the lack of perspective of spatial heterogeneity in relevant studies, it is difficult to propose specific strategies to alleviate the SUHI. This study discusses the impact of spatial heterogeneity on the day and night SUHI by taking one day and night in Beijing as an example, and uses it to improve the efficiency of SUHI simulation for related planning. This study, based on the local climate zone (LCZ), deeply discusses the relationship between urban morphology and the SUHI. Then, an artificial neural network (ANN) model with the LCZ is developed to predict the distribution of the SUHI. The results show that: (1) In summer, the general SUHI intensity distribution patterns are compact zone &gt; large low-rise zone &gt; open zone and medium floor zone &gt; low floor zone &gt; high floor zone. (2) Building density and albedo in dense areas are higher correlated with the SUHI than open areas. The building height has a significant negative correlation with the SUHI in high-rise zone, but has a positive correlation in middle and low floors. (3) The LCZ improves the overall accuracy of the ANN model, especially the simulation accuracy in the daytime. In terms of regions, LCZ2, LCZ8, and LCZ10 are improved to a higher degree. This study is helpful to formulate the SUHI mitigation strategies of “adapting to the conditions of the LCZ” and provide reference for improving the sustainable development of the urban thermal environment.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/land11112050,"",,

Cities from developing countries, in particular, are experiencing high air pollution levels. To address this challenge, the new WHO global air quality guidelines and various nations are mandating cities to implement clean air measures. However, these implementations are largely hindered by limited observations, siloed city operations, absence of standard processes, inadequate outreach, and absence of collaborative urban air quality management (UAQM) governance. The world is experiencing transformative changes in the way we live. The 4th industrial revolution technologies of artificial intelligence, Internet of Things, big data, and cloud computing bridge gaps between physical, natural, and personal entities. Globally, smart cities are being promulgated on the premise that technologies and data aid in improving urban services. However, in many instances, the smart city programs and UAQM services may not be aligned, thereby constraining the cumulative advantage in building urban resilience.

Historically, each component in urban water development evolved over time with different objectives for “different” types of water. Even today, the trend continues, as different urban water services are managed in silos. This trend is less sustainable, resilient, and reliable, mainly because of significant pressures on freshwater supplies exerted by the increasing population, demand for high living standards, rapid urbanization, and climate change. To cope with these challenges, the conventional thinking needs to change. This paper identifies a number of significant research gaps related to inter-relationships among various UWS service components. An innovative paradigm, the “one water” approach (OWA), which considers “urban water” as a single entity, is investigated herein. Currently, Australia, the USA, and Singapore are leading the implementation of the OWA, whereas only a few Canadian municipalities have embraced OWA at a very basic level. Among the EU nations, the Netherlands have emphasized the need for integrated water resource management in an urban environment. This review highlights the challenges in adopting the OWA, and also proposes guiding principles in ongoing water management practices. Institutional complexities involving an intricate regulatory structure for different UWS service components, a wider fragmentation in decision making at government levels, and insufficient stakeholder engagement within and between water utilities and other institutions present serious challenges. Various strategies such as, data sharing between water utilities, use of novel technologies (e.g., artificial intelligence, sensor technologies), and visionary leadership at different government levels have been identified as key drivers for the adoption and implementation of the OWA. The authors believe that a paradigm shift from “conventional” approach to OWA is needed to increase resiliency and reliability of water services and assist decision-makers of UWSs.","",https://doi.org/10.1139/er-2020-0090,"",,

rayyan-210781399,The Impact of Climate Change on Urban Transportation Resilience to Compound Extreme Events,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Global warming, sea-level rise, and rapid urbanization all increase the risk of compound extreme weather events, presenting challenges for the operation of urban-related infrastructure, including transportation infrastructure. In this context, some questions become important. For example, what are the temporal and spatial distribution and development trends of transportation resilience when considering the impact of multilpe extreme weather events on the urban transportation system? What is the degree of loss of urban transportation resilience (UT resilience) under different extreme event intensities, and how long will it take for the entire system to restore balance? In the future, if extreme weather events become more frequent and intense, what trends will urban transportation resilience show? Considering these problems, the current monitoring methods for transportation resilience under the influence of extreme events are lacking, especially the monitoring of the temporal and spatial dynamic changes of transportation resilience under the influence of compined extreme events. The development of big data mining technology and deep learning methods for spatiotemporal predictions made the construction of spatiotemporal data sets for evaluating and predicting UT resilience-intensity indicators possible. Such data sets reveal the temporal and spatial features and evolution of UT resilience intensity under the influence of compound extreme weather events, as well as the related future change trends. They indicate the key research areas that should be focused on, namely, the transportation resilience under climate warming. This work is especially important in planning efforts to adapt to climate change and rising sea levels and is relevant to policymakers, traffic managers, civil protection managers, and the general public.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/su14073880,"",,

Land use planning strategies and instruments for regulating urban expansion are faced with challenges, including insufficient data availability to offer insights into the possible future urban expansion. This study integrated empirical data derived from Geographic Information Systems, Remote Sensing, and surveys of experts to offer insights into the possible future urban expansion under spatial planning scenarios to support land use planning and environmental sustainability of city-regions. We analyzed the spatial determinants of urban expansion, calibrated the land cover model using the Multi-Layer Perceptron Neural Network and Markov, and developed three scenarios to simulate land cover from 2017 to 2030 and to 2050. The scenarios include Business As Usual that extrapolates past trends; Regional Land Use Plan that restricts urban expansion to the land designated for urban development, and; Adjusted Urban Land that incorporates the leapfrogged settlements into the land designated for urban development. Additionally, we quantified the potential degradation of environmentally sensitive areas by future urban expansion under the three scenarios. Results indicated a high, little, and no potential degradation of environmentally sensitive areas by the future urban expansion under the Business As Usual, Adjusted Urban Land, and Regional Land Use Plan scenarios respectively. The methods and the baseline information provided, especially from the Adjusted Urban Land scenario showed the possibility of balancing the need for urban expansion and the protection of environmentally sensitive areas. This would be useful to improve the environmental sustainability of the Sub-Saharan African city-regions and across the Global South, where insufficient data availability challenges land use planning.","",https://doi.org/10.1007/s10708-020-10317-x,"",,
rayyan-210781401,Building resilience into smart mobility for urban cities: an emerging economy perspective,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Population growth in urban cities has created transport problems such as traffic congestion, pollution, accidents, and infrastructure failures. These problems often lead to disruption of mobility, especially in emerging economies. The goal of any city is to have a resilient transport system that is free from frequent and severe disruptions. Resilience can be incorporated into smart mobility systems to create a robust, integrated and intelligent transport system. Therefore, this study sought to determine resilience factors required for a resilient smart mobility system in emerging economies. The study used interpretive structural modelling (ISM) to establish the causal interrelationships among the factors drawing from data from experts in smart cities, city transport and academia. It was found that the most critical factor to drive resilience is foresight – the ability to anticipate disruptions. Three other resilience factor categories identified were dynamism, certainty and optimisation, which all point to the importance of building dynamic capabilities. The key implication for practice highlights the role that human and artificial intelligence can play in anticipating natural, social and infrastructure disruptions. ISM offered a mechanism to determine the critical causal resilience factors to be prioritised amongst the competing demands on the limited resources of emerging economies. Apart from foresight, which was found to be a driving factor, the other resilience factors are equally strong linkage factors (influence each other), thus further revealing the complexities that decision-makers in urban cities of emerging economies constantly face. A research agenda for resilience in smart mobility in emerging economies was developed.","",https://doi.org/10.1080/00207543.2022.2139866,"",,

Innovative methods for data acquisition, processing, and maintaining spatial information are needed in response to the global challenges of urbanization and complex urban infrastructure. Current technological developments in remote sensing and geo-spatial information science provide enormous opportunities in this respect. Over the past decade, the increasing usage of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), satellite and airborne-based acquisitions, as well as active remote sensing sensors such as LiDAR, resulted in high spatial, spectral, radiometric, and temporal resolution data. Moreover, significant progress has also been achieved in automatic image orientation, surface reconstruction, scene analysis, change detection, classification, and automatic feature extraction with the help of artificial intelligence, spatial statistics, and machine learning. These technology developments, applied to LA, are now being actively demonstrated, piloted, and scaled.

However, limited progress has been made in bringing effective urban planning strategies to help control traffic demand and resulting air pollutants. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the interrelation between urban form, traffic volume, and air quality with a spatiotemporal stratified method. The method extracts and preprocesses traffic volume data in spatial (polluted and unpolluted zones) and temporal (periods in holidays and workdays) dimensions. Three decision tree models (random forest, random tree, M5 model tree) and two comparison models (multiple linear regression, artificial neural network) are used to examine the relationships. The final results show that the spatiotemporal stratification approach effectively reveals the interrelations, and the random forest model outperforms the other models. Specifically, highly aggregated roads and industrial areas are more associated with traffic volume in polluted zones. The dominance of waterway and vegetation shows a strong association with traffic volume in unpolluted zones. The degree of association also varies significantly between workdays and holidays. Our spatiotemporal stratified approach reveals heterogeneous relationships between urban form, traffic volume, and air quality and provides insightful references on sustainable urban development.","",https://doi.org/10.1177/2399808321995822,"",,

Therefore, exploring land use/cover change is of great significance to urban planning and sustainable development. In this study, we preprocessed multiperiod land use and socioeconomic data, combined with spatial zoning, multilayer perception (MLP) artificial neural network, and Markov chain (MC), to construct a cellular automaton model of spatial zoning. Moreover, with the help of ArcGIS 10.2 and TerrSet 18.07 software, we explore the current status of land use and predict future changes. The results showed that drastic changes have occurred among different land use classes in Jinzhou District over the past 13 years owing to the impact of economic development and reclamation projects. Construction land, arable land, and waters have changed by +85.09, −24.42, and −23.62 km 2 , respectively. By comparing the FoM and Kappa coefficients, we concluded that the prediction accuracy of partitioned MLP-MC is better than that of unpartitioned MLP-MC. Therefore, using the spatial zoning approach to identify the conversion rules among land use classes in different zones can more effectively predict future land use changes and provide a reference for urban planning and policy making.","",https://doi.org/10.1155/2020/3547323,"",,

Therefore, it is necessary to evaluate the suitability of roof greening for buildings in cities. However, most current evaluation methods are based on qualitative and conceptual research. In this paper, a methodological framework for roof greening suitability evaluation is proposed based on the basic units of building roofs extracted via deep learning technologies. The building, environmental and social criteria related to roof greening are extracted using technologies such as deep learning, machine learning, remote sensing (RS) methods and geographic information system (GIS) methods. The technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution (TOPSIS) method is applied to quantify the suitability of each roof, and Sobol sensitivity analysis of the score results is conducted. The experiment on Xiamen Island shows that the final evaluation results are highly sensitive to the changes in weight of the green space distance, population density and the air pollution level.

rayyan-210781411,A Methodology to Increase the Accuracy of Particulate Matter Predictors Based on Time Decomposition,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Particulate matter (PM) is one of the most harmful air pollutants to human health studied worldwide. In this scenario, it is of paramount importance to monitor and predict PM concentration. Artificial neural networks (ANN) are commonly used to forecast air pollution levels due to their accuracy. The use of partition on prediction problems is well known because decomposition of time series allows the latent components of the original series to be revealed. It is a matter of extracting the “deterministic” component, which is easy to predict the random components. However, there is no evidence of its use in air pollution forecasting. In this work, we introduce a different approach consisting of the decomposition of the time series in contiguous monthly partitions, aiming to develop specialized predictors to solve the problem because air pollutant concentration has seasonal behavior. The goal is to reach prediction accuracy higher than those obtained by using the entire series. Experiments were performed for seven time series of daily particulate matter concentrations (PM2.5 and PM10–particles with diameter less than 2.5 and 10 micrometers, respectively) in Finland and Brazil, using four ANNs: multilayer perceptron, radial basis function, extreme learning machines, and echo state networks. The experimental results using three evaluation measures showed that the proposed methodology increased all models’ prediction capability, leading to higher accuracy compared to the traditional approach, even for extremely high air pollution events. Our study has an important contribution to air quality prediction studies. It can help governments take measures aiming air pollution reduction and preparing hospitals during extreme air pollution events, which is related to the following United Nations sustainable developments goals: SDG 3—good health and well-being and SDG 11—sustainable cities and communities.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/su12187310,"",,

For quantitative analysis of the correlation between the Pearl River Delta urban expansion and changes in habitat quality under the influence of the policy, we first analyzed the habitat quality change based on the InVEST model and then measured the impact of construction land expansion on the habitat quality through habitat quality change index (HQCI) and contribution index (CI) indicators. Finally, the correlation between urbanization level and habitat quality was evaluated using geographically weighted regression (GWR) and the Self-organizing feature mapping neural network (SOFM). The results indicated that: (1) during the study period, the habitat quality index decreased from 0.7181 to 0.6672 owing to urban expansion, and the decrease was most significant from 2000 to 2010. (2) The urbanization index had a negative effect on the habitat quality, but this improved after 2000, reflecting the positive effect of policies such as ""ecological civilization construction"" (3) The importance of ecological civilization varies greatly among cities in the study area: Shenzhen, Dongguan, Foshan, and Zhongshan have the best level of green development.

This is particularly obvious in governorates where there is no desert backyard (e.g., Gharbia) for urban expansion. This work presents an overview of machine learning-based and state-of-the-art remote sensing products and methodologies to address the issue of random urban expansion, which negatively impacts environmental sustainability. The study aims (1) to investigate the land-use/land-cover (LULC) changes over the past 27 years, and to simulate the future LULC dynamics over Gharbia; and (2) to produce an Urbanization Risk Map in order for the decision-makers to be informed of the districts with priority for sustainable planning. Time-series Landsat images were utilized to analyze the historical LULC change between 1991 and 2018, and to predict the LULC change by 2033 and 2048 based on a logistic regression–Markov chain model. The results show that there is a rapid urbanization trend corresponding to a diminution of the agricultural land. The agricultural sector represented 91.2% of the total land area in 1991, which was reduced to 83.7% in 2018. The built-up area exhibited a similar (but reversed) pattern. The results further reveal that the observed LULC dynamics will continue in a like manner in the future, confirming a remarkable urban sprawl over the agricultural land from 2018 to 2048. The cultivated land changes have a strong negative correlation with the built-up cover changes (the R2 were 0.73 in 1991–2003, and 0.99 in 2003–2018, respectively). Based on the Fuzzy TOPSIS technique, Mahalla Kubra and Tanta are the districts which were most susceptible to the undesirable environmental and socioeconomic impacts of the persistent urbanization. Such an unplanned loss of the fertile agricultural lands of the Nile Delta could negatively influence the production of premium agricultural crops for the local market and export.

Climate change and current susceptibilities exacerbated the coastal flood loss and damage resulting in livelihoods and property damage. Urban areas in the Low to Lower-Middle Income Countries are expected to be disproportionately impacted by the disaster, given a higher share of citizens living in the Low Elevation Coastal Zone, limited financial resources, and poorly constructed disaster protection. Documentation of historical coastal floods, population, and property affected, could advance the assessment by considering those parameters in risk analysis. Besides, incorporating such geographic features e.g., mangroves as the ecological solution for alternative coastal flood protection in the prediction is also essential. Mangrove is considered fit for the LLMIC primarily situated in the tropical zone. The prediction utilizing spatial Machine Learning (ML) could aid climate-related disaster risk analysis and contribute to risk reduction and policy suggestions to improve disaster resilience. The research aims to archive recent studies on the application of geospatial science empowering Artificial Intelligence, notably ML in coastal flood risk assessment, so-called GIS-based AI. Another aim is to document population, property, and mangrove distribution across the LLMIC. Artificial Neural Networks were mostly utilized for disaster risk assessment in past research. The number of 58 historical coastal flood events and 908 expected coastal flood hotspots for 2006 to 2021 has been documented. Over 1,2 million Km2 falls under vulnerable areas toward coastal flood in LLMIC under different settlement types where Large City (urban areas) dominates it.

A recent study has shown that up to 80% of the population of some cities in Africa fall under the poverty line. Other studies have shown that poverty is one of the main contributors to residents’ poor health and social conflict. Reducing the number of people living in poverty and improving their living conditions have become some of the main tasks for many nations and international organizations. On the other hand, urban gentrification has been taking place in the poor neighborhoods of all major cities in the world. Although gentrification can reduce the poverty rate and increase the GDP and tax revenue of cities and potentially bring opportunities for poor communities, it displaces the original residents of the neighborhoods, negatively impacting their living and access to social services. In order to support the sustainable development of cities and communities and improve residents’ welfare, it is essential to identify the location, scale, and dynamics of urban poverty and gentrification, and remote sensing can play a key role in this. This paper reviews, summarizes, and evaluates state-of-the-art approaches for identifying and mapping urban poverty and gentrification with remote sensing, GIS, and machine learning techniques.

Identifying and classifying the different types of urban parks are important for analyzing the sustainable development and the greening progress in cities. Existing studies have predominantly focused on the data extraction of urban green spaces as a whole, while there have been relatively few studies that have considered different categories of urban parks and their impact, which makes it difficult to characterize or predict the spatial distribution and structures of urban parks and limits further refinement of urban research. At present, the classification of urban parks relies on the physical features observed in remote sensing images, but these methods are limited when mapping the diverse functions and attributes of urban parks. Crowd-sourced geographic data may more accurately express the social functions of points of interest (POIs) in cities, and, therefore, employing open data sources may assist in data extraction and the classification of different types of urban parks. This paper proposed a multi-source data fusion approach for urban park classification including POI and urban functional zone (UFZ) data. First, the POI data were automatically reclassified using improved natural language processing (NLP) (i.e., text similarity measurements and topic modeling) to establish the links between urban park green-space types and POIs. The reclassified POI data as well as the UFZ data were then subjected to scene-based data fusion, and various types of urban parks were extracted using data attribute analysis and social attribute recognition for urban park mapping. Experimental analysis was conducted across Beijing and Hangzhou to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, which had an overall classification accuracy of 82.8%.

To develop cost-effective agricultural solutions, 90% intensification of technological farming is required for achieving agricultural inputs and market demands. Today, the agricultural sector is affected by various factors like increased labor costs, increased population, crop failures, unpredictable yields, extreme weather, climate change, market fluctuations, etc. All these factors have directly or indirectly affected the socioeconomic status of farmers. With such a large number of challenges and increasing demands there is a need to implement an artificial intelligence-based approach for developing smart farming environment for the real-time monitoring and management of agricultural issues. According to a UN report, two-thirds of the world population will migrate to urban areas, resulting in a major decline in the agricultural workforce. This chapter proposes a smart farming environment based on artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain technology (BCT). Artificial Intelligence can be harnessed to automate and manage the agricultural and related tasks while blockchain technology can help in intensifying agri-food and supply chains. A sensational AI-based approach will help in developing the smart farming environment that can efficiently gather and monitor data for the real-time monitoring to address the uncertain issues faced by the agricultural community. BCT can handle issues related to the increased demands for agricultural products with transparency and trust. It will also accompany a variety of certifications schemes on branded agricultural products that face issues related to claims, labels and adulterations. BCT can prove to be an efficient solution for agricultural products’ safety, quality and sustainability. It will ensure the permanency of records during data sharing.

Creating a walkable city is an effective way to build a low-carbon and healthy city. With the development of cities, walkability concepts and theories are constantly being given new life, and research methods and design strategies continue to be updated. A city’s walkability and walkability index have become current research hotspots. Based on prior research on walkability and related urban policies, this study selects Coomera Town on the Gold Coast of Queensland, Australia, as the research area because of Coomera Town policy regulations and environmental requirements. This study utilizes traditional qualitative and quantitative research methods, machine mining technology, and the deep learning big data analysis technology to conduct thematic design research in a real place.

How to carry out scientific green infrastructure planning becomes an important issue in flood control and disaster relief. Based on historical media records of urban waterlogging from 2017 to 2020 and combined with variables about topography, land cover and socioeconomics, we used the Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBFNN) to conduct urban waterlogging susceptibility assessment and simulate the risk of waterlogging in different scenarios of green land configuration in Shenzhen. The results showed that: (1) high proportions of impervious surface and population could increase the risks in Luohu and Futian districts, followed by Nanshan and Baoan districts, while high proportions of green space could effectively reduce the risks in southeastern Shenzhen; (2) urban waterlogging in Luohu and Futian districts can be alleviated by strengthening green infrastructure construction while Longgang and Longhua districts should make comprehensive use of other flood prevention methods; (3) turning existing urban green space into impervious surfaces would increase the risks of waterlogging, which is more evident in places with high proportions of green space such as Dapeng and Yantian districts. The effectiveness of green infrastructures varies in different spatial locations. Therefore, more attention should be paid to protecting existing green spaces than cultivating more green infrastructures in urban waterlogging alleviation.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/rs13214433,"",,

The link between balanced urban growth and ESs is critical for sustainable urban development. The study followed pluralist approach for evaluating and comparing the land-cover-based economic assessment of sustainable, moderately sustainable, and unsustainable cities. The artificial intelligence-based future land cover changes were evaluated using geographic future land use simulation software with geographic information system. A case-specific modification of value coefficients for computing ecosystem service value (ESV) was applied on case cities. A workable scale was developed by exploring relation of ESs and built-up of three extreme cases. The scale has different combinations of ESs and built-up from worst to best scenario with related ESV changes for optimal utilization of land. The scale helped to assess the spatial resource and natural capital balance of any area. The results showed that the ideal ratio of ESs and built-up density range for balanced sustainable development is between 1.35 and 3.64 with ESVs between INR 10.00 million/hectare and INR 8.45 million/hectare, respectively. On applying the scale, the results showed that only 25% of the city peripheral area comes under ideal range.

Therefore, in order to protect the ecological environment, regulate urban development and pursue the maximization of ecological benefits, it is necessary to analyze, simulate and predict land use change. In this study, Hengyang City was taken as the study area, and based on the current land use data of Hengyang City in 2010, 2015, and 2018, the land use type transfer during 2010–2015 and 2015–2018 was analyzed. Then, starting from 2010, the FLUS model was used to simulate the spatial distribution of land use in 2015 and 2018, and then the spatial distribution of land use in Hengyang City in 2025 was predicted with the Markov prediction method under the premise of ecological protection priority. The results show that the change in ecological land in Hengyang City is mainly distributed in the surrounding and marginal areas, because the topography of Hengyang City is a basin. Changes in land type in Hengyang City in 2015 were subtle and difficult to observe. However, in 2018, the transformation of non-ecological land into ecological land was obvious, and the distribution area of ecological land expanded significantly. The Kappa index of the results simulated by the FLUS model based on neural network is above 0.72, and overall accuracy is above 0.9, which is highly consistent with the actual situation. It is reasonable and convincing to predict the spatial distribution of land use in the context of ecological protection. The predicted results can be useful for urban planning and land use distribution and provide a reference for relevant decision-makers.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/su131810458,"",,

Several diseases such as asthma and cardiovascular conditions are becoming more diffuse, due to a rise in pollution exposure and a more sedentary lifestyle. Healthcare providers deal with increasing new challenges, and thanks to fast-developing big data technologies, they can be faced with systems that provide direct support to citizens. In this context, within the EU-funded Participatory Urban Living for Sustainable Environments (PULSE) project, we are implementing a data analytic platform designed to provide public health decision makers with advanced approaches, to jointly analyze maps and geospatial information with healthcare and air pollution data. In this paper we describe a component of such platforms, which couples deep learning analysis of urban geospatial images with healthcare indexes collected by the 500 Cities project. By applying a pre-learned deep Neural Network architecture, satellite images of New York City are analyzed and latent feature variables are extracted. These features are used to derive clusters, which are correlated with healthcare indicators by means of a multivariate classification model. Thanks to this pipeline, it is possible to show that, in New York City, health care indexes are significantly correlated to the urban landscape.

Rainstorms and waterlogging have become one of the most common natural disasters in the coastal areas of China. As a result, the concept of an ecological sponge city was incorporated into the construction of cities in the future. Taking Shenzhen–Shantou special cooperation zone (SSCZ), we constructed a storm flooding model based on the SCS flow generation model and GIS to explore the spatial distribution characteristics of the flooding risk in a rainstorm of 100-year lasting 1 h. Combined with population and economic indicators, a radial basis function (RBF) network was utilized to evaluate the environmental risk, the vulnerability of disaster-bearing bodies, and the rain–flood resilience of sponge cities. The self-organizing feature mapping (SOFM) model was used for cluster analysis. Spatial differences were found in the construction suitability of the study area. A suitable construction area (73.59% of the entire area) was located downtown. The construction of the artificial spongy body in the highest vulnerable area (3.25%) needs to be strengthened. The control construction area (3.3%) is located along the banks of the river, with relatively high risk and low resilience of flood control engineering. Ecological construction (19.85%) serves as the sponge body of ecological buffer.

However, while the field is rich with case studies, methods that provide rich data across municipalities and potentially at global scale remain underdeveloped, and comparative insights remain scarce. Here we summarize contributions to the focus issue on ‘Systematizing and Upscaling Urban Climate Solutions’, also drawing from presentations given at an accompanying conference in 2018. We highlight four core areas for systematizing and upscaling urban climate mitigation solutions. First, with more and better (big) data and associated machine learning methods, there is increasing potential to compare types of cities and leverage collective understanding. Second, while urban climate assessments have mostly emphasized urban planning, demand-side action as related to both behavioral change and modified social practices relevant to urban space deserve more academic attention and integration across a diverse set of social sciences. Third, climate mitigation would be intangible as a single objective at the urban scale, and measures and solutions that coordinate mitigation coherently with adaptation and broader sustainable development goals require explicit conceptualization and systematization. Forth, all insights should come together to develop governance frameworks that translate scientific exercises into concrete, realistic and organized action plans on the ground, for all cities.","",https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/abb0b2,"",,

However, existing attempts to understand and use the opportunities offered by AI for SDG 11 have been explored sparsely, and the shortage of empirical evidence about the practical application of AI remains. In this chapter, we analyze the contribution of AI to support the progress of SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities). We address the knowledge gap by empirically analyzing the AI systems (N = 29) from the AIxSDG database and the Community Research and Development Information Service (CORDIS) database. Our analysis revealed that AI systems have indeed contributed to advancing sustainable cities in several ways (e.g., waste management, air quality monitoring, disaster response management, transportation management), but many projects are still working for citizens and not with them. This snapshot of AI's impact on SDG11 is inherently partial, yet useful to advance our understanding as we move towards more mature systems and research on the impact of AI systems for social good.","",https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2202.02879,"",,
rayyan-210781476,Review of the status of urban flood monitoring and forecasting in TC region,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"With the impacts of rapid urbanization and climate change, the urban flood has increasingly become a major hazard risk faced by human being in recent decades. The catastrophic urban flood events appear every year in the world, especially in Asia and Pacific region due to its geographical composition, density population and un-even economic and social development. To reduce the urban flood risk and enhance the resilience of vulnerable communities, especially coastal communities, the Members of ESCAP/WMO Typhoon Committee (TC) have made their great efforts including engineering and non-engineering measures based on their different national conditions. As a key part of non-engineering measures, it is recognized that improving urban flood monitoring and forecasting is a measure with high benefit related to cost on urban flood risk reduction. In recent years, TC Members enhanced their capacity building on urban flood monitoring, forecasting and simulation, inundation mapping, etc. In order to enhance the technical cooperation and exchange on this aspect, Typhoon Committee Working Group on Hydrology (WGH) conducted two projects on “Urban Flood Risk Management in Typhoon Committee Area (UFRM)” and “Operation System for Urban Flood Forecasting and Inundation Mapping (OSUFFIM)” in the past years.

The results show that: 1) Urban resilience is an optimal combination of the resilience of size, density, and morphology. The urban resilience of Shenyang displays scale effect; the overall resilience level increases with the increase in scale, while the spatial difference and spatial similarity tend to decrease resilience. 2) As 2 km, 1 km and 2 km are scale inflection points of average value curves for size resilience, density resilience and morphology resilience, respectively in an urban setting; the optimal scale unit of comprehensive resilience is 1 km. Choosing 1 km–2 km as the basic spatial scale better depicts overall pattern and detailed characteristics of resilience in Shenyang. The spatial amplitudes of 0.5 km and 1 km are sensitive points for spatial autocorrelation of morphology and density resilience, size, and comprehensive resilience to scale effect. 3) The major landscape factors of urban size and morphology resilience transform with scale expansion. Aggregation index (AI) has a significant impact on urban resilience at different scales; its influence increases significantly with the increase in scale. 4) The high-level area of comprehensive resilience in Shenyang is the eastern ecological corridor area, while the low value area is the peripheral extension area of the city. To promote the overall level of resilience in Shenyang, this paper argues that the construction of ecological infrastructure should be strengthened in the peripheral extension area in a balanced manner. In the city center, population and building density should be controlled; the intensity of human activities should be reduced; impetus should be placed on landscape heterogeneity; and the homogeneous expansion of the area of construction should be prevented. In the eastern ecological corridors, the exploitation of ecosystem lands should be strictly controlled, and the integrity of the green landscape patches should be maintained.","",https://doi.org/10.1007/s11769-020-1163-7,"",,

Both mappings can benefit from crowdsourcing and participatory sound monitoring that has been made possible due to the large use of internet connections and mobile devices with dedicated apps. This paper is a “scoping review” to provide an overview of the potential, benefits, and drawbacks of participatory noise monitoring in noise and soundscape mapping applications, while also referring to metrological aspects. Gathering perceptual data on soundscapes by using digital questionnaires will likely be more commonly used than printed questionnaires; thus, the main differences between the experimental protocols concern the measurement of acoustic data. The authors propose to classify experimental protocols for in-field soundscape surveys into three types (GUIDE, MONITOR, and SMART) to be selected according to the survey’s objectives and the territorial extension.

The surface urban heat island (UHI) is the temperature in the lowest layers of the urban atmosphere; it is critical to the surface’s energy balance and makes it possible to determine internal climates that affect the livability of urban residents. Therefore, the surface UHI is recognized as one of the crucial global issues in the 21st century. This phenomenon affects sustainable urban planning, the health of urban residents, and the possibility of living in cities. In the context of sustainable landscapes and urban planning, more weight is given to exploring solutions for mitigating and adapting to the surface UHI effect, currently a hot topic in urban thermal environments. This study evaluated the relationship between land use/land cover (LULC) and land surface temperature (LST) formation in the temperate mountain valley city of Kathmandu, Nepal, because it is one of the megacities of South Asia, and the recent population increase has led to the rapid urbanization in the valley. Using Landsat images for 2000, 2013, and 2020, this study employed several approaches, including machine learning techniques, remote sensing (RS)-based parameter analysis, urban-rural gradient analysis, and spatial composition and pattern analysis to explore the surface UHI effect from the urban expansion and green space in the study area. The results revealed that Kathmandu’s surface UHI effect was remarkable. In 2000, the higher mean LST tended to be in the city’s core area, whereas the mean LST tended to move in the east, south, north, and west directions by 2020, which is compatible with urban expansion. Urban periphery expansion showed a continuous enlargement, and the urban core area showed a predominance of impervious surface (IS) on the basis of urban-rural gradient analysis. The city core had a lower density of green space (GS), while away from the city center, a higher density of GS predominated at the three time points, showing a lower surface UHI effect in the periphery compared to the city core area. This study reveals that landscape composition and pattern are significantly correlated with the mean LST in Kathmandu. Therefore, in discussing these findings in order to mitigate and adapt to prominent surface UHI effects, this study provides valuable information for sustainable urban planning and landscape design in mountain valley cities like Kathmandu.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/rs14164047,"",,

The results show that image features and machine learning approaches can be used to identify urban poverty with the best model performance with a coefficient of determination, R2, of 0.5341 and 0.5324 for Jiangxia and Huangpi, respectively, although some differences exist among the approaches and study areas. The importance of each variable differs for each approach and study area; however, the relatively important variables are similar. In particular, four variables achieved relatively satisfactory prediction results for all models and presented obvious differences in varying communities with different poverty levels. Housing inequality within low-income neighborhoods, which is a response to gaps in wealth, income, and housing affordability among social groups, is an important manifestation of urban poverty.

This study intended to estimate the carbon storage and sequestration capabilities using the InVEST model under different land use land cover (LULC) classes in Abha, Saudi Arabia. We used a support vector machine (SVM) for LULC mapping. For the future forecasting of the LULC map, we employed cellular automata (ANN-CA). Expansion of built-up land is the primary source of CO 2 .

An accurate measurement of poverty is a critical input to the quality and efficiency of poverty alleviation in rural areas. However, poverty, as a geographical phenomenon, inevitably has a spatial correlation. Neglecting the spatial correlation between areas in poverty measurements will hamper efforts to improve the accuracy of poverty identification and to design policies in truly poor areas. To capture this spatial correlation, this paper proposes a new poverty measurement model based on a neural network, namely, the spatial vector deep neural network (SVDNN), which combines the spatial vector neural network model (SVNN) and the deep neural network (DNN). The SVNN was applied to measure spatial correlation, while the DNN used the SVNN output vector and explanatory variables dataset to measure the multidimensional poverty index (MPI). To determine the optimal spatial correlation structure of SVDNN, this paper compares the model performance of the spatial distance matrix, spatial adjacent matrix and spatial weighted adjacent matrix, selecting the optimal performing spatial distance matrix as the input data set of SVNN. Then, the SVDNN model was used for the MPI measurement of the Yangtze River Economic Belt, after which the results were compared with three baseline models of DNN, the back propagation neural network (BPNN), and artificial neural network (ANN). Experiments demonstrate that the SVDNN model can obtain spatial correlation from the spatial distance dataset between counties and its poverty identification accuracy is better than other baseline models. The spatio-temporal characteristics of MPI measured by SVDNN were also highly consistent with the distribution of urban aggregations and national-level poverty counties in the Yangtze River Economic Belt. The SVDNN model proposed in this paper could effectively improve the accuracy of poverty identification, thus reducing the misallocation of resources in tracking and targeting poverty in developing countries.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/ijgi11010050,"",,
rayyan-210781499,DTEx: A dynamic urban thermal exposure index based on human mobility patterns,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Extreme heat in light of climate change is increasingly threatening the health and comfort of urban residents. Understanding spatio-temporal patterns of heat exposure is a critical factor in directing mitigation measures. Current heat vulnerability indices provide insight into heat sensitivities within given communities but do not account for the dynamic nature of the human movement as people travel for different activities. Here, we present a new Dynamic urban Thermal Exposure index (DTEx) that captures the varying heat exposure within urban environments. We developed the DTEx to understand human heat exposure patterns in a mid-sized city. This index incorporates the human movement pattern and the heat hazard pattern obtained via novel and advanced techniques. We generated the human movement pattern from large-scale, anonymized smartphone location data. The heat hazard patterns were extrapolated via machine learning models from air temperature data measured through vehicle-mounted sensors. The exposure index was then developed by combining the two parameters using their standard-deviation-classified indices. Our exposure index varied between 2 and 12, indicating low to high thermal exposures. Several high-temperature spots associated with a large volume of foot traffic are successfully identified through this DTEx. We observed the hottest spots at shopping plazas but not specifically in the urban center. During the selected football gameday, the exposure index surged across most places near the football stadium but was reduced considerably further away. The proposed DTEx is novel because it provides dynamic heat monitoring capability to facilitate heat mitigation strategies at vulnerable locations in urban environments. Combining the mobility data and extensive sensor data generates rich details on the most heat-exposed areas due to human congregation. Such information will be critical for risk communication and urban planning for policymakers.

rayyan-210781500,Evaluating urban wastewater remediation efficiency of the Hydroponic Vetiver System through predictive modelling using Artificial Neural Network,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Urban wastewater management requires alternative cost-efficient, energy-efficient sustainable technologies as conventional electro-mechanical engineering systems are unable to keep pace with the wastewater infrastructure requirements of the rapidly urbanizing world, especially in developing countries. Sustainable urban wastewater management remains a distant goal as none of the existing systems address the treatment of the urban water bodies, which are the last mile of the urban wastewater journey. Literature review shows that among the various potential decentralized solutions, the Hydroponic Vetiver system (HVS) shows good performance in remediation of different types of wastewater. The paper aims to evaluate the general quantitative wastewater remediation potential of the HVS by formulating a predictive model using Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The water quality parameters (WQP) under discussion are Biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and Chemical oxygen demand (COD). The four significant predictor variables of inlet concentration, plant density, hydraulic retention time, and pH value were analysed from secondary sources of laboratory experiments conducted worldwide. The trained, tested, and validated neural network models for BOD and COD showed high predictive accuracy and goodness-of-fit. The HVS predictive model will enable municipal policymakers, urban planners, and water managers to measure the wastewater remediation potential of any given urban water body.","",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eti.2021.102007,"",,

Given this fast urban evolution, urban monitoring is a key process to qualify sustainable development. Vertical changes need to be assessed, and various methods for 3D change detection have been published. However, there is no common quantitative benchmark assessing their performance in urban areas yet. In this paper, we aim to fill this gap and introduce a simulation tool to generate synthetic 3D point cloud data in a well-controlled scenario. These data are then used to compare qualitatively and quantitatively representative 3D change detection methods for urban areas. These methods are based on distance computation (DSMd, C2C, M3C2), traditional machine learning (RF with stability feature) and deep learning (Feed Forward and Siamese networks). We distinguish between binary and multi-class classification of changes at different levels (3D points, 2D pixels, and 2D patches). While deep neural networks have led to numerous success in remote sensing, we show that they do not systematically outperform more simple methods for 3D change detection. Besides, the existing networks are limited to 2D patches while outputs at the pixel or point scale are more attractive.","",https://doi.org/10.1109/igarss47720.2021.9553018,"",,
rayyan-210781503,A Cloud-Based Mapping Approach Using Deep Learning and Very-High Spatial Resolution Earth Observation Data to Facilitate the SDG 11.7.1 Indicator Computation,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"As urbanized areas continue to expand rapidly across all continents, the United Nations adopted in 2015 the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 11, aimed at shaping a sustainable future for city dwellers. Earth Observation (EO) satellite data can provide at a fine scale, essential urban land use information for computing SDG 11 indicators in order to complement or even replace inaccurate or invalid existing spatial datasets. This study proposes an EO-based approach for extracting large scale information regarding urban open spaces (UOS) and land allocated to streets (LAS) at the city level, for calculating SDG indicator 11.7.1. The research workflow was developed over the Athens metropolitan area in Greece using deep learning classification models for processing PlanetScope and Sentinel-1 imagery, employing freely-available cloud environments offered by Google. The LAS model exhibited satisfactory results while the best experiment performance for mapping UOS, considering both PlanetScope and Sentinel-1 data, yielded high commission errors, however, the cross-validation analysis with the UOS area of OpenStreetMap exhibited a total overlap of 67.38%, suggesting that our workflow is suitable for creating a “potential” UOS layer. The methodology developed herein can serve as a roadmap for the calculation of indicator 11.7.1 through national statistical offices when spatial data are absent or unreliable.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/rs14041011,"",,

There has been a dearth of research on community resilience to urban floods, especially among transient communities, and therefore there is a need to conduct further empirical studies to improve our understanding, and to identify appropriate interventions. Thus, this work combines two existing resilience assessment frameworks to address these issues in three different types of transient community, namely an urban village, commercial housing, and apartments, all located in Wuhan, China. An analytic hierarchy process–back propagation neural network (AHP-BP) model was developed to estimate the community resilience within these three transient communities. The effects of changes in the prioritization of key resilience indicators under different environmental, economic, and social factors was analyzed across the three communities. The results demonstrate that the ranking of the indicators reflects the connection between disaster resilience and the evaluation units of diverse transient communities. These aspects show the differences in the disaster resilience of different types of transient communities. The proposed method can help decision makers in identifying the areas that are lagging behind, and those that need to be prioritized when allocating limited and/or stretched resources.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/w12102784,"",,

rayyan-210781512,A New Graph-Based Fractality Index to Characterize Complexity of Urban Form,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Examining the complexity of urban form may help to understand human behavior in urban spaces, thereby improving the conditions for sustainable design of future cities. Metrics, such as fractal dimension, ht-index, and cumulative rate of growth (CRG) index have been proposed to measure this complexity. However, as these indicators are statistical rather than spatial, they result in an inability to characterize the spatial complexity of urban forms, such as building footprints. To overcome this problem, this paper proposes a graph-based fractality index (GFI), which is based on a hybrid of fractal theory and deep learning techniques. First, to quantify the spatial complexity, several fractal variants were synthesized to train a deep graph convolutional neural network. Next, building footprints in London were used to test the method, where the results showed that the proposed framework performed better than the traditional indices, i.e., the index is capable of differentiating complex patterns. Another advantage is that it seems to assure that the trained deep learning is objective and not affected by potential biases in empirically selected training datasets Furthermore, the possibility to connect fractal theory and deep learning techniques on complexity issues opens up new possibilities for data-driven GIS science.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/ijgi11050287,"",,
rayyan-210781517,Smart cities in the time of climate change and Covid‐19 need digital twins,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Pre-Covid there was the beginnings of a coalescence around Climate Change as the overarching aim of advanced urban digital transformation. Climate change is a wicked problem with no silver bullet but there is one arena that adversely affects climate change more than any other; cities. Only 29% of the world is land, cities currently occupy 3% of that representing 0.9% of the earth surface. Buildings occupy between 70 and 80% of every city and we spend 87% of our life in them. Buildings, a tiny percentage of the planet, consume 75% of world electricity, 40% of global energy, are responsible for 40% of the total GHG emissions, consume 25% of the global water supply and generate 40% of total solid waste. The problem is only going to get worse as more people move to cities for economic, social, or conflict reasons. Roughly 50% of the world population of 7.7 billion people lives in cities and it is predicted to rise to 70% by 2050; this could create another 5000 cities. The greatest rise in urbanisation will take place in the developing world, which is the least well equipped to deal with issues of pollution, energy, air quality, water shortages, waste, transport, health and civil resilience. The focus on Climate has now been usurped by the effect Covid has had on the world economy and how we live and work in Cities, but an answer to both is we need cities to work smarter and to do that we need to understand them better. In the developed world there is a plethora of technologies now reaching the market. Proptech, Plantech, Digital twins, VR & AR, Ledger technologies, 5G, AI and Deep Learning, Data Exchanges and Edge Computing that will shape citizen engagement, economic growth and physical infrastructure, but we also need the basic infrastructure of power, water and connectivity in the developing world. Currently, the new enabling technologies are still siloed into point solutions with companies developing single technology value propositions around AI, proptech, Ledger et al. Whatever our working definition of what comprises 'smart', the market is maturing into IoT platforms where hardware captures data and software analyses it. To enable us to turn data into information allowing insight to inform impact we also need to share information in an appropriate way and surface it in the most accessible manner possible. We are capturing ever-increasing amounts of data, but our ability to share it with the correct checks and balances is problematic. This will have to change and there is an increasing need for Data Trust models that allow us to synthesise data, and Digital Twinning; where we create a virtual replica of the physical and can feed real time information into the model allowing scenario planning and the meshing of soft and hard data that creates a narrative around arenas such as Health, Wellbeing and Mobility. This leverages the new disruptive technologies mentioned above, allowing city authorities agile and informed decision making while facilitating the sharing of information between the public and private sectors. As such, it creates a market for enabling technologies while informing growth in the city. One of the things I noticed when working in the planning department of a local authority in the distant past was that if I used words to explain something I wanted to do, I would be met with blank faces and disinterest. However, if I produced a schematic, plan or map the whole atmosphere changed. Tables were cleared, eyes lit up, erstwhile disinterest turned into enthusiasm. You get the same affect with architects, engineers and developers. These are people who think visually. Nowadays, the same can be seen with the new sorcerers of IoT; data scientists and AI specialists and is the reasons why Digital Twins are both attractive and effective. We create so much data, most of which is binary, we need a way to make it talk to us. Maps, charts et al. gave us a two-dimensional view and models gave us a static 3D representation. Related information- reports, impact assessments, development strategies and the rest were created by the kilo then sealed in PDFs and only read by, well, nobody. My planning department experience was 30 years ago, and the stunning thing is the industry hasn't changed. This is still the way we do master planning. We have moved on through CAD and BIM, but the overall process is the same, still frustrated by the inaccessibility of information entombed in PDFs. The above is all the more disappointing given we are well into the 4th Industrial revolution, characterized by a fusion of technologies that is blurring the lines between the physical, digital, and biological spheres. This is where Digital Twins come into their own. A simple definition of a digital twin is that is a digital model of a physical asset, which continuously collects information (via sensors, drones or other IoT and IIoT data collection tools) and applies advanced analytics, machine-learning and artificial intelligence (AI) to gain valuable real-time insights about the physical asset's performance, operation or profitability. In essence, you create a 3D model of a physical entity and populate it with data allowing you manage the physical entity but also to run scenario planning for predicative insight. You now have an accessible oracle for planners, developers, officials, politicians and citizens to share information and contribute to the future of smart communities. The importance of this new way of tracking how people move through cities and buildings is a tool we can use to ameliorate the challenges of Covid-19. A recent Forbes article predicted that a post-coronavirus future will include more contactless interfaces and interactions, strengthened digital infrastructure, better monitoring and use of IoT and Big Data, AI-enabled development, and an increased reliance on robots. Put simply, the trend will be towards virtualization and digitalization in all industries, and Digital Twin-making will pave the road to virtualization and digitalization in the building industry. More online meetings, less travel; more shared, flexible workspaces, fewer assigned physical spaces; more operational data collection via IOT sensors, less manual reporting; more AI-enabled analysis, less guesswork; more maintenance tasks performed by robots, less manual intervention. Building sensors will monitor the temperature of people both within and without the building and can tell if groups are forming without the concomitant social distancing, allowing messages to be sent asking that groups disperse. Apps can be used to identify and book desk and room slots before arrival in buildings and can track people and infection blooms allowing Authorities the ability to see the spread of contagion and respond accordingly. Arguably, there is a recognised three-step plan to build successful advanced urban infrastructure in the 21st Century city. Firstly, through consultation, agree a set of open outcomes and time frame. Secondly, work out what people will have to do differently (enabled by what technology) to achieve those outcomes. Thirdly, define what success looks like and have the ability to measure the difference. To make the above work you must have data that you can turn into information, giving you insight so you can make decisions with real impact. For that to happen successfully you need to be able to synthesise information and share data through the right governance and protocols. It can be argued that IT companies have failed to lead the smart cities market because they are wedded to outdated business models where the return on investment (ROI) is too short and still focus on proprietary point solutions. Instead, the market is increasingly led by the Architecture, Engineering and Construction companies (AEC) who have a longer ROI, the ability to take a lead contractor role and bring in Telco, Utilities and IT as, and when, required but the force majeure is that we need visibility of decision making options facilitated by advanced urban digital infrastructure. In conclusion, Digital twins are not a universal panacea but an integral part of the maturation of Advanced Urban Digital Urbanisation colloquially described as the 'smart city' market. We are creating the base data through the development of IoT platforms, we have yet to create Data exchanges that will allow for data synthesis that will bring the most out of Digital Twins and concomitant fit for purpose ROI models that would allow us to build the business case for initial and subsequent investment. So where will the leadership come from? International Financial Institutions such as the European Commission, World Bank, Asian Development Bank et al., Sovereign Wealth Funds and National Governments have the funding and mandate but no unifying plan. Perhaps the relationship between Covid-19, climate change and cities is the burning platform they need to create one.","",https://doi.org/10.1049/iet-smc.2020.0071,"",,

This is certainly the case with experimental urban planning and design solutions and sustainability transitions. This article identifies and evaluates the role of pilot projects and demonstration zones along the Huangpu River. These clusters and zones are supposed to guide the urban regeneration of the former industrial waterfronts and to accelerate innovative development in Shanghai and the wider Yangtze Delta Region. The Huangpu River as a whole is considered an urban lab and a showcase of ecological civilisation policies, with a strong ‘people oriented’ focus on improving the overall quality and attractiveness of urban life. Following three decades of rapid urban expansion, Shanghai’s urban development model is shifting toward one that emphasizes densification and the reuse of existing elements. The motto of Shanghai’s latest master plan is “Striving for an Excellent Global City.” One of the pathways to realize this expectation is the creation of thematic clusters for creative industries, financial institutes, AI, and technology, media and telecommunication industries. These clusters are high-density investment projects meant to support and accelerate the transformation of Shanghai into a service economy. There are important similarities between these projects in Shanghai and the role of urban labs in theories of sustainability transitions. Drawing on these theories and those of ecological civilization, this article examines how these so-called ‘experimental’ urban megaprojects along the river contribute to Shanghai’s effort to take the lead in developing sustainable urban transitions.","",https://doi.org/10.17645/up.v6i3.4194,"",,

The objective of this study is to create an urban quality of life index map for Al Ain city in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The research aligns with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals number ten (reduce inequalities) and eleven (sustainable cities and communities). In this study, remote sensing images and GIS vector datasets were used to extract biophysical and infrastructure facility indicators. The biophysical indicators are normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), normalized difference water index (NDWI), modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI), soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI), enhanced normalized difference impervious surfaces index (ENDISI), normalized difference built-up index (NDBI), land surface temperature (LST), slope, and land use land cover (LULC). In addition, infrastructure facility indicators such as distances to main roads, parks, schools, and hospitals were obtained. Additional infrastructure facility variables namely built-up to green area and build-up to bare soil area ratio were extracted from the LULC map. Machine learning was used to classify satellite images and generate LULC map. Random Forest (RF) was found as the best machine learning classifier for this study. The overall classification and Kappa hat accuracy was 95.3 and 0.92, respectively. Both biophysical and infrastructure facility indicators were integrated using principal component analysis (PCA). The PCA analysis identified four components that explain 75% of the variance among the indicators. The four factors were interpreted as the effect of LULC, infrastructure facility, ecological, and slope. Finally, the components were assigned weights based on the percentage of variance they explained and developed the UQoL map. Overall, the result showed that greenness has a greater effect on the spatial pattern of UQoL in Al Ain city.

Obtaining the urban land use type and analyzing the changes in their land use can lead to better management of the relationship between economic development and resource utilization. In this paper, a residual-intelligent module network was proposed to solve the problems of low classification accuracy and missing objects edge information in traditional computer classification methods. The classification of four Landsat-TM/OLI images from 1993–2020 for Jiaozuo city (the first batch of resource-exhausted cities in China) was realized by this method. The results (overall accuracy was 98.61%, in 2020 images) were better than the comparison models (support vector machine, 2D-convolutional neural network, hybrid convolution networks; overall accuracy was 87.12%, 96.16%, 98.46%, respectively) and effectively reduced the loss of information on the edge of the ground objects. On this basis, six main land use types were constructed by combining field surveys and other methods. The characteristics and driving forces of spatial-temporal change in land use were explored from the aspect of social, economic and policy factors. The results showed that from 1993 to 2020 the cultivated land, forest land, water body and other land types in the study area decreased by 690.97 km2, 57.54 km2, 47.04 km2 and 59.43 km2, respectively. The construction land and bare land increased by 839.38 km2 and 15.57 km2, respectively. The transfer of land use types was mainly from cultivated land to construction land, with a cumulative conversion of 920.95 km2 within 27 years. The driving forces of land use in the study area were analyzed by principal component analysis (PCA) and regression analysis. The spatial-temporal evolution of land use types was affected by policy changes, the level of social development and the adjustment in the economy, industry and agriculture structure. The investment in fixed assets and per capita net income in rural areas were the top two influencing factors and their cumulative contribution rate was 94.62%.

Remote sensing provides an effective method for real-time mapping and monitoring of urban green space changes in a large area. However, with the continuous improvement of the spatial resolution of remote sensing images, traditional classification methods cannot accurately obtain the spectral and spatial information of urban green spaces. Due to complex urban background and numerous shadows, there are mixed classifications for the extraction of cultivated land, grassland and other ground features, implying that limitations exist in traditional methods. At present, deep learning methods have shown great potential to tackle this challenge. In this research, we proposed a novel model called Concatenated Residual Attention UNet (CRAUNet), which combines the residual structure and channel attention mechanism, and applied it to the data source composed of GaoFen-1 remote sensing images in the Shenzhen City. Firstly, the improved residual structure is used to make it retain more feature information of the original image during the feature extraction process, then the Convolutional Block Channel Attention (CBCA) module is applied to enhance the extraction of deep convolution features by strengthening the effective green space features and suppressing invalid features through the interdependence of modeling channels.-Finally, the high-resolution feature map is restored through upsampling operation by the decoder. The experimental results show that compared with other methods, CRAUNet achieves the best performance. Especially, our method is less susceptible to the noise and preserves more complete segmented edge details. The pixel accuracy (PA) and mean intersection over union (MIoU) of our approach have reached 97.34% and 94.77%, which shows great applicability in regional large-scale mapping.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/f12111441,"",,

Examining Chinese-invested smart city development in Southeast Asia,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"AbstractWith increasing public–private partnership and international cooperation in smart city development across the Global South, Chinese firms are poised to take advantage of growing business opportunities, a situation that few studies have examined. This empirical case study of the Forest City, a Chinese-invested greenfield smart city project in Iskandar Malaysia, begins to fill that gap. This megaproject represents the coming together of overlapping economic development interests of the local authorities and the profit motivations of the Chinese investor. However, the project’s use of the ‘smart city’ discourse contrasts with the reality of limited technology adoption. Its visibility and considerable socio-economic and environmental impacts also sparked opposition from affected local stakeholders and criticism from political leaders. This prompted the Chinese investor to change business practices and enhance corporate social responsibility (CSR) efforts to mitigate risks and ensure project continuity, yet their effectiveness is limited. The study confirms the underlying tensions in the smart city discourse, where economic development and profit imperatives risk running counter to social and environmental sustainability. It also contributes to scholarly understanding of Chinese overseas investments, illustrating the host country’s agency and how better Chinese CSR practices offer the potential for risk mitigation.Keywords: Smart citysustainable developmentforeign direct investmentChinaMalaysiaurban megaprojects Disclosure statementNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the authors.Notes1 Malaysia’s Multimedia Super Corridor (MSC) was established in 1996 as a high-tech business district linking the Petronas Twin Towers in downtown Kuala Lumpur with the international airport, modelled on California’s Silicon Valley.

rayyan-210781549,"Towards achieving Sustainability of coastal environments: Urban Growth analysis and prediction of Lagos, State Nigeria",,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"The most extensive urban growths in the next 30 years are expected to occur in developing countries. Lagos, Nigeria - Africa’s second most populous megacity- is a prime example. To achieve more sustainable and resilient cities, there is a need for modeling the urban growth patterns of major cities and analyzing their implications. In this study, the urban growth of Lagos state was modeled using the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network for the transition modeling and the Markov Chain analysis for the change prediction, achieving a model accuracy of 81.8%. An innovative visual validation of the model results using the ArcGIS was combined with kappa correlation statistics. The results show that by 2031, built-up areas will be the most spatially extensive LULC class in the study area with percentage coverage of 34.1% as opposed to 9% in 1986. The coverage of bare areas is also expected to increase by 53% between 2016 and 2031. Conversely, 24.9% and 68.3% loss of forestlands and wetlands respectively, are expected between 2016 and 2031. In view of the 11th goal of SDGs which focuses on achieving sustainable cities and communities, the objectives of African Union’s Agenda 2063, and based on the urban growth trends observed, the study recommends a prioritization of vertical expansion as opposed to the current horizontal urban growth trends in the study area.","",https://doi.org/10.4314/sajg.v9i2.11,"",,
rayyan-210781556,Mapping demand and supply of functional niches of urban green space,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Urban green spaces (UGS) provide essential social-cultural and biophysical functions, including opportunities for physical activity, mental restoration and cooling. However, suitable methods to assess the demand and supply of the different functions provided by UGS are lacking, as current methods mostly focus on biophysical aspects while socio-cultural functions are poorly integrated. Building on Public Participatory Geographic Information Systems (PPGIS) we assess the spatial distribution of social functions of UGS in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. With advanced statistical and machine learning techniques we combine subjective responses with objective data on spatial characteristics to map the demand and supply of social functions. We identify clear differences in demand for relaxing, cooling, social and walking functions between different user groups. We develop maps of Amsterdam that identify mismatches between demand and supply of social functions of green spaces. The function of relaxing shows a high mismatch and is likely to be traded-off against the function of meeting others in areas. This trade-off might be exacerbated in housing development areas in the future. Likewise, future housing plans are shown to cause a more than 25% increase in the mismatch between supply and demand for cooling in a number of neighbourhoods by 2030. Our proposed methods and improved understanding of such mismatches and trade-offs can help to better inform planning decisions and help realise liveable and sustainable cities.","",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2022.109031,"",,

In this study, 58 major tourist cities in China were taken as the research object, and an evaluation index system of TEV was constructed from two aspects of sensitivity and adaptive capacity. On the basis of the entropy weight method, TOPSIS model, obstacle diagnosis model, and BP neural network model, this study analyzed the spatiotemporal patterns, obstacle factors, and future trends of TEV in major tourist cities in China from 2004 to 2019. The results show three key findings: (1) In terms of spatiotemporal patterns, the TEV index of most of China’s tourist cities has been on the rise from 2004 to 2019. Cities throughout the coast of China’s Yangtze River Delta and the Pearl River Delta urban agglomeration show high vulnerability, whereas low vulnerability has a scattered distribution in China’s northeast, central, and western regions. (2) The proportion of international tourists out of total tourists, tourism output density, urban industrial sulfur dioxide emissions per unit area, urban industrial smoke and dust emission per unit area, and discharge of urban industrial wastewater per unit area are the five major obstacles affecting the vulnerability degree of the tourism economy. (3) According to the prediction results of TEV from 2021 to 2030, although the TEV of many tourist cities in China is increasing year by year, cities with low TEV levels occupy the dominant position. Research results can provide reference for tourist cities to prevent tourism crises from occurring and to reasonably improve the resilience of the tourism economic system.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/ijgi10100644,"",,

Common urban footprint data provide high-resolution city extents but lack essential information on the distribution, pattern, and characteristics. The Local Climate Zone (LCZ) offers an efficient and standardized framework that can delineate the internal structure and characteristics of urban areas. Global-scale LCZ mapping has been explored, but are limited by low accuracy, variable labeling quality, or domain adaptation challenges. Instead, this study developed a custom LCZ data to map key Korean cities using a multi-scale convolutional neural network. Results demonstrated that using a novel, custom LCZ data with deep learning can generate more accurate LCZ map results compared to conventional community-based LCZ mapping with machine learning as well as transfer learning of the global So2Sat dataset.","",,"",,

We used Kamrowska-Załuska’s approach for evaluating AI-based solutions’ potential in urban planning. We narrowed down the research to the educational and economic aspects of smart cities. Furthermore, we used a systematic literature review. We propose solutions supporting the implementation process of net zero policies benefiting from single actions of urban dwellers based on the Greencoin project developed by us. By following smart city sectors, the paper introduces AI-based solutions which can enrich Greencoin by addressing the following needs: (1) shaping pro-environmental behaviors, (2) introducing instruments to reinforce the urban management process, (3) supporting bottom-up initiatives allowing to shape urban resilience, (4) enhancing smart mobility, (5) shaping local economies supporting urban circularity, and (6) allowing better communication with residents. Our research fills the gap in the limited group of studies focused on shaping climate awareness, enhancing smart governance, and supporting social participation and inclusion.

rayyan-210781566,Mapping Multi-Temporal Population Distribution in China from 1985 to 2010 Using Landsat Images via Deep Learning,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Fine knowledge of the spatiotemporal distribution of the population is fundamental in a wide range of fields, including resource management, disaster response, public health, and urban planning. The United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals also require the accurate and timely assessment of where people live to formulate, implement, and monitor sustainable development policies. However, due to the lack of appropriate auxiliary datasets and effective methodological frameworks, there are rarely continuous multi-temporal gridded population data over a long historical period to aid in our understanding of the spatiotemporal evolution of the population. In this study, we developed a framework integrating a ResNet-N deep learning architecture, considering neighborhood effects with a vast number of Landsat-5 images from Google Earth Engine for population mapping, to overcome both the data and methodology obstacles associated with rapid multi-temporal population mapping over a long historical period at a large scale. Using this proposed framework in China, we mapped fine-scale multi-temporal gridded population data (1 km × 1 km) of China for the 1985–2010 period with a 5-year interval. The produced multi-temporal population data were validated with available census data and achieved comparable performance. By analyzing the multi-temporal population grids, we revealed the spatiotemporal evolution of population distribution from 1985 to 2010 in China with the characteristic of concentration of the population in big cities and the contraction of small- and medium-sized cities. The framework proposed in this study demonstrates the feasibility of mapping multi-temporal gridded population distribution at a large scale over a long period in a timely and low-cost manner, which is particularly useful in low-income and data-poor areas.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/rs13173533,"",,

However, arguably the greatest promise of urban analytics is to set up measurable objectives and track progress toward systemic development goals connected to human development and sustainability over the longer term. The challenge for such an approach is the connection between new technological capabilities, such as sensing and machine learning and local knowledge, and operations of residents and city governments. Here, we describe an emerging project for the long-term monitoring of sustainable development in fast-growing towns in the Galapagos Islands through the convergence of these methods. We demonstrate how collaborative mapping and the capture of 360-degree street views can produce a general basis for a broad set of quantitative analytics, when such actions are coupled to mapping and deep-learning characterizations of urban environments. We map and assess the precision of urban assets via automatic object classification and characterize their abundance and spatial heterogeneity. We also discuss how these methods, as they continue to improve, can provide the means to perform an ambient census of urban assets (buildings, vehicles, services) and environmental conditions.","",https://doi.org/10.1007/978-981-15-8983-6_4,"",,

Contextual design solutions and innovative approaches are urgently needed to transform the status quo. University-local government collaboration could be a way to encourage new thinking, new roles and design skills to develop solutions to these complex problems. This paper presents a case study analysis of such a collaboration. Qualitative research was conducted to establish the degree to which the exposure to real-life projects stimulates postgraduate design students’ transformative learning. The researchers also inquired into the benefits of the collaboration for the municipality. The participants’ reflections were recorded by means of anonymous questionnaires. The findings show that the live project created a municipal setting for seeking alternative solutions in design processes and outcomes. For the students, the project created rich social dynamics and an interplay of familiarity and uncertainty, which aided transformative learning. The students’ deeper learning indicates greater social empathy, reconsidering the role of the profession, greater design process flexibility, and learning and valuing skills across disciplines. The findings hold promise for a more just and sustainable future built environment through collaborations that transform the design professionals involved, the outcomes they pursue, and the processes they follow.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/land11010045,"",,

Global experience indicates that urban vitality can be stimulated through a reasonable urban design. However, it remains incompletely understood in the literature which building-related indicators can substantially affect urban vitality in Asian countries. To give an insight into this question, our study took a step forward by focusing specifically on the influence of the three-dimensional built environment on urban vitality, based on which decision makers could enhance urban vitality from the perspective of vertical building design. A machine-learning-based framework was developed in this study. First, we utilized several building-related indicators to thoroughly measure the spatial characteristics of buildings at the township level. Second, the relationship between a three-dimensional built environment and urban vitality was revealed based on a combined use of the correlation method, scatter charts, and a random forest. In the random forest, both a benchmark and a new model were constructed to evaluate the importance of those building-related indicators. The results suggested that urban vitality was closely related to the three-dimensional built environment, which played an even more important role than common benchmark factors in stimulating urban vitality. The building coverage ratio, density of tall buildings, and floor area ratio were essential spatial drivers behind urban vitality. Therefore, urban designers and decision makers should not only take traditional factors into account but also carefully consider the potential influence of high-rise buildings and the outdoor thermal environment so that urban vitality can be enhanced. Our study’s results can offer practical recommendations for improving urban vitality from the perspective of vertical building design. The proposed framework can also be used for measuring the potential influence of the three-dimensional built environment in other areas.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph20010734,"",,

rayyan-210781586,Evaluating the Comprehensive Benefit of Urban Renewal Projects on the Area Scale: An Integrated Method,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Globally, the challenges facing cities regarding urban decay, insufficient urban function, and fragmented urban development are enormous. Under this context, urban renewal provides opportunities to address these challenges and enhance urban sustainability. Thus, promoting urban renewal projects and improving their performance is a global topic. In many circumstances, urban renewal is planned and initiated on the project scale, but on the area scale, overall coordination of the projects can bring about comprehensive benefits to urban areas on a macro view. In practice, it still lacks a systematic evaluation approach to obtain a clear picture of such comprehensive benefits. In academia, the existing research studies are mainly focused on single-project evaluation. An integrated framework that provides a holistic assessment of area-scale project benefits is missing. Few fully consider the coupling coordination benefits between several urban renewal projects from an area-scale perspective. Thus, this paper aims to propose a framework for integrating an indicator evaluation system through a hybrid entropy weight method with Back Propagation (BP) neural network methods to evaluate the comprehensive benefit of urban renewal projects on the area scale, which is the level at which most development area-scale renewal projects take place in a city. The feasibility and effectiveness of this proposed framework are then verified in a case study of Chongqing, China. The results indicate that the proposed method that integrated multi-project characteristics can contribute to a bigger picture of benefit evaluation of urban renewal based on an area scale perspective. This therefore provides not only guidance for urban planners and policymakers to make better decisions, but also new insight for benefit evaluation in the field of urban development.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph20010606,"",,

This paper aims to utilize an unsupervised machine learning approach to identify urban-rural integration typologies based on multidimensional metrics regarding economic, population and social integration in China. Design/methodology/approach The study introduces partitioning around medoids (PAM) for the identification of urban-rural integration typologies. PAM is a powerful tool for clustering multidimensional data. It identifies clusters by the representative objects called medoids and can be used with arbitrary distance, which help make clustering results more stable and less susceptible to outliers. Findings The study identifies four clusters: high-level urban-rural integration, urban-rural integration in transition, low-level urban-rural integration and early urban-rural integration in backward stage, showing different characteristics. Based on the clustering results, the study finds continuous improvement in urban-rural integration development in China which is reflected by the changes in the predominate type. However, the development still presents significant regional disparities which is characterized by leading in the east regions and lagging in the western and central regions. Besides, achievement in urban-rural integration varies significantly across provinces. Practical implications The machine learning techniques could identify urban-rural integration typologies in a multidimensional and objective way, and help formulate and implement targeted strategies and regionally adapted policies to boost urban-rural integration. Originality/value This is the first paper to use an unsupervised machine learning approach with PAM for the identification of urban-rural integration typologies from a multidimensional perspective.

In order to analyze the impact of ecological security patterns on urban expansion, Hangzhou was taken as an example, the CA-Markov model and FLUS model were used to simulate the urban expansion pattern in 2030 under the natural development scenario and the ecological security scenario. The results showed that (1) the ecological source area in the study area is 630.90 km2 and was mainly distributed in the western mountainous area. There are 14 ecological corridors, primarily composed of valleys and rivers. Ecological nodes are mainly distributed on the north and south sides of the main urban area.

At a distance from the city center of 30 km, AI was relatively higher and was increasing, while AGR was declining. At a distance of 30-45 km, both AI and AGR were increasing, indicating that the focus of construction land was moving outwards.

Due to this dependency, future recreational opportunities provided by nature are at risk from climate change. To understand how climate change will impact recreation we need to understand current recreational patterns, but traditional data is limited and low resolution. Fortunately, social media data presents an opportunity to overcome those data limitations and machine learning offers a tool to effectively use that big data. We use data from the social media site Flickr as a proxy for recreational visitation and random forest to model the relationships between social, environmental, and climate factors and recreation for the peak season (summer) in California. We then use the model to project how non-urban recreation will change as the climate changes. Our model shows that current patterns are exacerbated in the future under climate change, with currently popular summer recreation areas becoming more suitable and unpopular summer recreation areas becoming less suitable for recreation. Our model results have land management implications as recreation regions that see high visitation consequently experience impacts to surrounding ecosystems, ecosystem services, and infrastructure. This information can be used to include climate change impacts into land management plans to more effectively provide sustainable nature recreation opportunities for current and future generations. Furthermore, our study demonstrates that crowdsourced data and machine learning offer opportunities to better integrate socio-ecological systems into climate impacts research and more holistically understand climate change impacts to human well-being.","",https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/ac65a3,"",,

In response to such a situation, alternative energy sources should be evaluated, especially on a regional basis. The recent pandemic and its effects show that the effective and widespread use of green energy sources should be increased, because air pollution causes an increased rate of COVID19 virus transmission. It is necessary to re-plan all sustainable energy resources on a regional basis because of the negative environmental impacts of burning fossil energy. On a global scale, there is an initiative to reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions related to renewable energy sources by 70% by 2050. In many applications, efficiency analysis and new technologies are among the primary topics. As the rate of urbanization rises, there is a great need for integrated new energy technologies that control local energy efficiency standards for cities, or even buildings. Urban planning is crucial to reducing energy use in buildings. Turkey aims to install 34 gigawatts (GW) of hydroelectric capacity, 20GW of wind energy, 5GW of solar energy, and 1GW power from geothermal or biomass-based on strategic green energy plans. Turkey will provide about 30 % of its total energy needs via renewable energy sources based on this plan by 2023. As is known, one of the most important sustainable energy sources is solar power derived from solar radiation. Solar power has a characteristic pattern compared to other sustainable energy sources, not only in seasonal but also in daily terms. The geographical requirements, vast flat terrain, and high irradiation levels of solar power plants make it ideal for promoting economic growth in the Central Anatolian inner regions of technological investments. In this study, we present estimations based on model results for the monthly variation of solar energy potential, efficiency. Study areas are in the vicinity of Ankara (Camlidere and Kecioren) in Central Anatolia. To forecast solar energy potential, hourly solar radiation (watt/m2) was processed with five years of data (from 2014 to 2018). Deep learning methodologies were applied to solar radiation data to build up future solar radiation data scenarios in 5-year forecast through the end of 2024. A 3-layer artificial neural network (ANN) consisting of 128-neurons with Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation was applied to the solar data. An LSTM layer using 64 neurons with ReLU activation functions for each neuron, was applied to build the hidden layer up. The output layer was built on the hidden dense layer using 2-neurons with a linear activation function. Solar power efficiency and performance of ANN models in the annual basin are presented in two study areas. The model's performance increases by up to 98% to estimate solar radiation and sunshine duration. There is sufficient evidence based on the results to invest in renewable energy sources using solar energy converting systems at both study areas.","",,"",,
rayyan-210781619,Applying State-of-the-Art Deep-Learning Methods to Classify Urban Cities of the Developing World,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"This paper shows the efficacy of a novel urban categorization framework based on deep learning, and a novel categorization method customized for cities in the global south. The proposed categorization method assesses urban space broadly on two dimensions-the states of urbanization and the architectural form of the units observed. This paper shows how the sixteen sub-categories can be used by state-of-the-art deep learning modules (fully convolutional network FCN-8, U-Net, and DeepLabv3+) to categorize formal and informal urban areas in seven urban cities in the developing world-Dhaka, Nairobi, Jakarta, Guangzhou, Mumbai, Cairo, and Lima. Firstly, an expert visually annotated and categorized 50 × 50 km Google Earth images of the cities. Each urban space was divided into four socioeconomic categories: (1) highly informal area; (2) moderately informal area; (3) moderately formal area, and (4) highly formal area. Then, three models mentioned above were used to categorize urban spaces. Image encompassing 70% of the urban space was used to train the models, and the remaining 30% was used for testing and validation of each city. The DeepLabv3+ model can segment the test part with an average accuracy of 90.0% for Dhaka, 91.5% for Nairobi, 94.75% for Jakarta, 82.0% for Guangzhou city, 94.25% for Mumbai, 91.75% for Cairo, and 96.75% for Lima. These results are the best for the DeepLabv3+ model among all. Thus, DeepLabv3+ shows an overall high accuracy level for most of the measuring parameters for all cities, making it highly scalable, readily usable to understand the cities' current conditions, forecast land use growth, and other computational modeling tasks. Therefore, the proposed categorization method is also suited for real-time socioeconomic comparative analysis among cities, making it an essential tool for the policymakers to plan future sustainable urban spaces.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/s21227469,"",,

This paper tries to provide a reference for other cities' digital infrastructure construction through case analysis. Design/methodology/approach The authors took Hangzhou Urban Brain as a typical case in urban digital infrastructure construction, and they conducted thorough research on its practice in facing COVID-19. The authors analyzed the key elements of Urban Brain, the application and the evaluation of Urban Brain through literature review, field investigation, questionnaire and interviews. Findings Hangzhou Urban Brain has been deeply applied in urban management and has a good foundation. Therefore, when the COVID-19 occurred, the Urban Brain played an important role. The detailed practices facing COVID-19 are mainly in five aspects: information collection and analysis, ensuring material supply by government–enterprise collaboration, using AI and Big Data to “Visualize” COVID-19, etc. Moreover, Urban Brain has won high evaluation. However, Hangzhou Urban Brain still has problems like data privacy and security, technical issues, etc. Originality/value This case study shows that Hangzhou's experience in Urban Brain construction is worthy of reference and promotion. Firstly, it can strengthen the understanding of digital infrastructure in responding to public health emergencies. Furthermore, it provides a reference for other urban governance worldwide by excavating the role and effect of digital infrastructure in preventing and controlling COVID-19. Thirdly, it explores how to improve the digital infrastructure construction to support public health challenges, which will help the cities grasp the actual value of data and make progress in this field. By this, it can provide references for cities in the world, especially in Asia to achieve sustainable city development.","",https://doi.org/10.1108/ecam-10-2021-0935,"",,
rayyan-210781621,Advancing residents’ use of shared spaces in Nordic superblocks with intelligent technologies,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"To support the sustainability of future cities, residents' living spaces need to be built and used efficiently, while supporting residents' communal wellbeing. Nordic superblock is a new planning, housing, and living concept in which residents of a neighborhood-a combination of city blocks-share yards, common spaces and utilities. Sharing living spaces is an essential element of this approach. In this study, our goal was to study the ways in which intelligent technology solutions-such as proactive, data-driven Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications-could support and even motivate the use of common areas in superblocks. To this end, we conducted a two-phase qualitative study: in the first phase, potential superblock residents (N = 12) shared their perspectives of sharing of living spaces in general, and more specifically of how intelligent technologies could support sharing spaces. In the second phase, two workshops with experts (N = 7) were held to gather understanding of possibilities of intelligent technologies in meeting the residents' expectations of space sharing. The results illustrate space sharing and communality as supportive factors for one another, enabled but also complicated by social interaction. Major possibilities for intelligent technologies to advance space sharing were seen in organizing the use of spaces and facilitating social interaction in the community. As an outcome, four roles incorporating several use purposes of intelligent technologies were found. The findings can inform the Human-Centered AI (HCAI) research and design improving sustainable living in future urban neighborhoods.","",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00146-022-01604-x,"",,

Local governments are able to easily collect detailed public tree inventories, data on trees located on private land are much more challenging and costly to collect. This means that new regulations to limit the removal of trees on private land go untested prior to their implementation, or fail to pass regulatory review processes. Without knowledge of the location of trees or the range of their different sizes, local governments are unable to predict where a new policy to prohibit the removal of trees of a certain size is likely to have the greatest effect, where enforcement should be concentrated, or to convince government, the development sector and local communities of the need for action to preserve trees. The aim of this study was to demonstrate how a supervised machine learning algorithm could be used as a cost-efficient method to understand tree sizes and locations on private land and to discuss how this information could be used for sustainable urban greening. This enables us to reflect on the potential for machine learning techniques to alter the choice of variables to select for measuring urban forests in future.","",https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4137384,"",,

However, the existing literature generally focuses on urban logistics while ignoring rural logistics. Taking the Chengdu-Chongqing agglomeration as an example, this study constructed a rural logistics index system and proposed a new dynamic assessment model for rural logistics development using a fuzzy neural network, Moran index, and Kernel density estimation. The results are as follows: the development of rural logistics has been enhanced, and gaps among cities have gradually narrowed over the past decade. In particular, the spatial distribution of rural logistics showcases a dual-core structure in the Chengdu-Chongqing agglomeration, which is different from the unipolar structure manifested in other urban agglomerations. Because of administrative barriers, the impact from the dual-core cities is very different: Chengdu has a significant spillover effect on its surrounding cities, which is not the case for Chongqing. The findings are of great significance for local governments to provide decision-making support for the sustainable development of urban agglomerations.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/su14159268,"",,
rayyan-210781628,Application of UAV remote sensing and machine learning to model and map land use in urban gardens,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract Urban gardens are an integral part of urban agricultural systems, contributing to ecosystem services, biodiversity and human wellbeing. These systems occur at fine scales, can be highly complex and therefore offer the opportunity to test mechanisms of ecological patterns and processes. The capacity to confidently characterize urban gardens and their land uses is still lacking, while it could provide the basis for assessing ecosystem service provision. Land classifications from remote sensing platforms are common at the landscape scale, but imagery often lacks the resolution required to map differences in land use of fine-scale systems such as urban gardens. Here, we present a workflow to model and map land use in urban gardens using imagery from an unoccupied aerial vehicle (UAV) and machine learning. Due to high resolutions (&amp;lt;5 cm) from image acquisition at low altitudes, UAV remote sensing is better suited to characterize urban land use. We mapped six common land uses in 10 urban community gardens, exhibiting distinct spatial arrangements. Our models had good predictive performance, reaching 80% overall prediction accuracy in independent validation and up to 95% when assessing model performance per cover class. Extracting spatial metrics from these land use classifications, we found that at the garden and plot scale, plant species richness can be estimated by the total area and patchiness of crops. Land use classifications like these can offer an accessible tool to assess complex urban habitats and justify the importance of urban agriculture as a service-providing system, contributing to the sustainability and livability of cities.","",https://doi.org/10.1093/jue/juac008,"",,

rayyan-210781637,Exploring the Effects of Transportation Supply on Mixed Land-Use at the Parcel Level,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"The interactive relationship between transportation and land use has become more difficult to understand and predict, due to the economic boom and corresponding fast-paced proliferation of private transportation and land-development activities. A lack of coordination between transportation and land-use planning has created an imbalanced provision of transportation infrastructure and land-use patterns; this is indicated by places where a high-density land-development pattern is supported by a low-capacity transport system or vice versa. With this, literature suggests that Mixed Land-Use (MLU) developments have the potential to provide relevant solutions for urban sustainability, smart growth, inclusive public transit use, and efficient land-use. Therefore, this study employed deep neural network models—Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)—for forecasting the effect of transportation supply on the MLU pattern at the parcel level in the Jiang’an District, Wuhan, China. The findings revealed a strong relationship between the supply of public transportation and MLU. Moreover, the study results indicated that MLU is widely available in areas with high accessibility, high density, and proximity to the city center. The forecasting results from the MLP and LSTM models showed an average error of 5.55–7.36% and 3.62–4.28% for mixed use, respectively, while most of their 90th percentile errors were less than 13.73% and 10.46% for mixed use, respectively.

More extreme urban heat island (UHI) effects are not distributed equally, and often impact socioeconomically vulnerable populations the most. This study aims to quantify how land surface temperature (LST) changes with increasing green vegetation landscapes, identify disparities in urban warming exposure, and provide a method for developing evidence-based mitigation options. ECOSTRESS LST products, detailed land use and land cover (LULC) classes, and socioeconomic variables were used to facilitate the analysis. We examined the relationship between LST and the fractions of LULC and socioeconomic factors in the city of Phoenix, Arizona. A machine learning approach (Random Forest) was used to model LST changes by taking the LULC fractions (scenario-based approaches) as the explanatory variables. We found that vegetation features—trees, grass, and shrubs—were the most important factors mitigating UHI effects during the summer daytime. Trees tended to lower surface temperature more effectively, whereas we observed elevated daytime LST most often near roads. Meanwhile, higher summer daytime temperatures were observed on land with unmanaged soil compared to the built environment. We found that affluent neighborhoods experienced lower temperatures, while low-income communities experienced higher temperatures. Scenario analyses suggest that replacing 50% of unmanaged soil with trees could reduce average summer daytime temperatures by 1.97°C if the intervention was implemented across all of Phoenix and by 1.43°C if implemented within the urban core only. We suggest that native trees requiring little to no additional water other than rainfall should be considered. We quantify mitigation options for urban warming effect under vegetation management interventions, and our results provide some vital insight into existing disparities in UHI impacts. Future UHI mitigation strategies seriously need to consider low-income communities to improve environmental justice. These can be used to guide the development of sustainable and equitable policies for vegetation management to mitigate heat exposure impacts on communities.","",https://doi.org/10.3389/fenvs.2021.795474,"",,

Typically, population distribution maps are derived from census data from the region of interest. Nevertheless, in several low- and middle-income countries, census information may be unreliable, outdated or unsuitable for spatial analysis at the intra-urban level, which poses severe limitations in the development of urban population maps of adequate quality. To address these shortcomings, we deploy a novel framework utilizing multisource Earth Observation (EO) information such as Sentinel-2 and very-high-resolution Pleiades imagery, openly available building footprint datasets, and deep learning (DL) architectures, providing end-to-end solutions to the production of high quality intra-urban population distribution maps in data scarce contexts. Using several case studies in Sub-Saharan Africa, namely Dakar (Senegal), Nairobi (Kenya) and Dar es Salaam (Tanzania), our results emphasize that the combination of DL and EO data is very potent and can successfully capture relationships between the retrieved image features and population counts at fine spatial resolutions (100 meter). Moreover, for the first time, we used state-of-the-art domain adaptation methods to predict population distributions in Dar es Salaam and Nairobi (R2 = 0.39, 0.60) that did not require national census or survey data from Kenya or Tanzania, but only a sample of training locations from Dakar. The DL architecture is based on a modified ResNet-18 model with dual-streams to analyze multi-modal data. Our findings have strong implications for the development of a new generation of urban population products that are an output of end-to-end solutions, can be updated frequently and rely completely on open data.","",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jag.2022.103013,"",,

Cities in Africa are growing faster than other regions but have limited data to guide urban planning and policies. Our aim was to use smart sensing and analytics to characterise the spatial patterns and temporal dynamics of features of the urban environment relevant for health, liveability, safety and sustainability. We collected a novel dataset of 2.1 million time-lapsed day and night images at 145 representative locations throughout the Metropolis of Accra, Ghana. We manually labelled a subset of 1,250 images for 20 contextually relevant objects and used transfer learning with data augmentation to retrain a convolutional neural network to detect them in the remaining images. We identified 23.5 million instances of these objects including 9.66 million instances of persons (41% of all objects), followed by cars (4.19 million, 18%), umbrellas (3.00 million, 13%), and informally operated minibuses known as tro tros (2.94 million, 13%). People, large vehicles and market-related objects were most common in the commercial core and densely populated informal neighbourhoods, while refuse and animals were most observed in the peripheries. The daily variability of objects was smallest in densely populated settlements and largest in the commercial centre.

Fractal indicators, such as fractal dimension, ht-index, and cumulative rate of growth (CRG) index, have been proposed as measures of such complexity. However, these major fractal indicators are statistical rather than spatial, which leads to failure of characterizing the spatial complexity of urban morphology, such as building footprints. To overcome this problem, in this paper a graph-based fractality index (GFI), based on a hybrid of fractal theories and deep learning techniques, is proposed. To quantify the spatial complexity, several fractal variants were synthesized to train a deep graph convolutional neural network. Building footprints of London were used to test the method and the results show that the proposed framework performs better than traditional indices.

Today more than ever, urban and transport policies, constrained by social distancing measures and travel restrictions, must be conceptualized and implemented with a particular emphasis on sustainable walkability. Most of the walkability models apply observation and subjective methods to measure walkability, whereas few studies address walkability based on sense perception. To fill this gap, we aim at investigating the perceived neighbourhood walkability (PNW) based on sense perception in a neighbourhood of Brussels. We designed a survey that integrates 22 items grouped into 5 dimensions (cleanness, visual aesthetics, landscape and nature, feeling of pressure, feeling of safety), as well as the socio-demographic attributes of the participants. Using various statistical methods, we show that socio-demographics have almost no effects on perceived neighbourhood walkability. Nonetheless, we found significant differences between groups of different educational backgrounds. Furthermore, using a binomial regression model, we found strong associations between PNW and at least one item from each grouping dimension. Finally, we show that based on a deep neural network for classification, the items have good predictive capabilities (78% of classification accuracy). These findings can help integrate sense perception into objective measurement methods of walkable environments.

Currently, half of the world’s population is living in urban areas, which only account for less than 1% of the Earth. A rapid and unplanned urban expansion, however, has also resulted in serious challenges to sustainable development of the cities, such as traffic congestion and loss of natural environment and open spaces. This study aims at modeling and predicting the expansion of urban areas in South Korea by utilizing an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) model. To this end, the study utilized the land-cover maps in 2007 and 2019, as well as several socioeconomic, physical, and environmental attributes. The findings of this study suggest that the urban expansion tends to be promoted when a certain area is close to economically developed area with gentle topography. In addition, the existence of mountainous area and legislative regulations on land use were found to significantly reduce the possibility of urban expansion. Compared to previous studies, this study is novel in that it captures the relative importance of various influencing factors in predicting the urban expansion by integrating the XGBoost model and SHAP values.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/app12189169,"",,
rayyan-210781670,A DEEP LEARNING APPROACH FOR THE RECOGNITION OF URBAN GROUND PAVEMENTS IN HISTORICAL SITES,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract. Urban management is a topic of great interest for local administrators, particularly because it is strongly connected to smart city issues and can have a great impact on making cities more sustainable. In particular, thinking about the management of the physical accessibility of cities, the possibility of automating data collection in urban areas is of great interest. Focusing then on historical centres and urban areas of cities and historical sites, it can be noted that their ground surfaces are generally characterised by the use of a multitude of different pavements. To strengthen the management of such urban areas, a comprehensive mapping of the different pavements can be very useful. In this paper, the survey of a historical city (Sabbioneta, in northern Italy) carried out with a Mobile Mapping System (MMS) was used as a starting point. The approach here presented exploit Deep Learning (DL) to classify the different pavings. Firstly, the points belonging to the ground surfaces of the point cloud were selected and the point cloud was rasterised. Then the raster images were used to perform a material classification using the Deep Learning approach, implementing U-Net coupled with ResNet 18. Five different classes of materials were identified, namely sampietrini, bricks, cobblestone, stone, asphalt. The average accuracy of the result is 94%.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/isprs-archives-xliii-b4-2022-321-2022,"",,

Worldwide consumption and production also increase the use of the natural environment and resources in a way that continues to have destructive impacts on the planet. This article is to study the Sustainable Development Goal 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities and Goal 12: Sustainable Consumption and Production, to study the role of digital technology and digital transformation in Circular Economy, and to investigate how digital based applications can contribute to sustainable cities and communities. Documentary study and literature review were used for data collection. Moving towards circular economy is a challenge due to the lack of connections and accurate information sharing, complication in developing circular business, product, and process models as well as inability to access information and education among consumers. The result shows that digital technologies including big data, analytics, IoT, AI, blockchain, etc. can play a vital role in connecting different sources of information, processing data, providing more access to information, and easing out the complication in designing, production, and service. It can also be used as a tool in managing congestion, risks, and environmental impacts in cities and communities.","",https://doi.org/10.17762/pae.v58i1.917,"",,
rayyan-210781672,IDENTIFYING INFORMAL SETTLEMENTS IN SATELLITE IMAGES FOR SUSTAINABLE URBAN PLANNING: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF METHODS AVAILABLE,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"The current urbanization trend, along with a shortage of affordable housing, has led to the proliferation of informal settlements in most cities in the global south. The variance in spectral, spatial image resolution, texture, colours, and complex physical shapes of informal urban settlements has made it difficult to provide accurate evidence for urban planners to achieve sustainable urban planning. In this article, the PRISMA methodology was used to thoroughly investigate various techniques used to classify informal settlements from satellite imagery between 2010 and 2021, as well as identify the methods' strengths and weaknesses, along with image indicators used in generating adequate information for sustainable urban planning. According to the study, the dominant models and approaches used to identify or detect informal settlements in satellite imagery for urban planning purposes are remote sensing, GIS, and artificial intelligence (machine learning) applications, as well as quantitative indicators. It was also revealed that without an integrated methodology, the proposed approaches used in different studies could not accurately detect and classify informal settlements. This is due to similarities in the texture of buildings of both formal and informal settlements, as well as variations in image spectral and spatial resolutions, as reported in previous studies.","",https://doi.org/10.35631/jistm.725008,"",,

There is a growing interest in underground building and growth worldwide. The reduced consumption of electricity, effective preservation of green land, sustainable wastewater and sewage treatment, efficient reverse degradation of the urban environment, and reliable critical infrastructure management can improve the quality of life. At the same time, technological innovations such as artificial intelligence (AI), cloud computing (CC), the internet of things (IoT), and big data analytics (BDA) play a significant role in improved quality of life. Hence, this study aims to integrate the technological innovations in urban underground engineering to ensure a high quality of life. Thus, this study uses big data analytics to carry out the status quo of foundation treatment and proposes a conceptual framework named the BDA with IoT on urban underground engineering (BI0T-UUE). This framework connects hidden features with various high-level sensing sources and practical predictive model characterization to lower building costs, productive infrastructure management, preparedness for disasters, and modern community smart services. The IoT integration gives an optimum opportunity to work towards the functionality of ‘‘digital doubles’’ of secret infrastructure, both economical and scalable, with the increasing sophistication and tooling of the underworld.

The Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, as one of the most developed megacities in China, sets up a goal of high-quality development while fostering ecosystem services. Therefore, assessing the ecosystem services in this study area is very important to guide further development. However, the spatial pattern of ecosystem services, especially at local scales, is not well understood. Using the available 2017 land cover product, Sentinel-1 SAR and Sentinel-2 optical images, a deep learning land cover mapping framework integrating deep change vector analysis and the ResUnet model was proposed. Based on the produced 10 m land cover map for the year 2020, recent spatial patterns of the ecosystem services at different scales (i.e., the GBA, 11 cities, urban–rural gradient, and pixel) were analyzed. The results showed that: (1) Forest was the primary land cover in Guangzhou, Huizhou, Shenzhen, Zhuhai, Jiangmen, Zhaoqing, and Hong Kong, and an impervious surface was the main land cover in the other four cities. (2) Although ecosystem services in the GBA were sufficient to meet their demand, there was undersupply for all the three general services in Macao and for the provision services in Zhongshan, Dongguan, Shenzhen, and Foshan. (3) Along the urban–rural gradient in the GBA, supply and demand capacity showed an increasing and decreasing trend, respectively. As for the city-level analysis, Huizhou and Zhuhai showed a fluctuation pattern while Jiangmen, Zhaoqing, and Hong Kong presented a decreasing pattern along the gradient. (4) Inclusion of neighborhood landscape led to increased demand scores in a small proportion of impervious areas and oversupply for a very large percent of bare land.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/su13137044,"",,

To achieve more sustainable and resilient cities, there is a need for modeling the urban growth patterns of major cities and analyzing their implications. In this study, the urban growth of Lagos state was modeled using the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network for the transition modeling and the Markov Chain analysis for the change prediction, achieving a model accuracy of 81.8%. An innovative visual validation of the model results using the ArcGIS was combined with kappa correlation statistics. The results show that by 2031, built-up areas will be the most spatially extensive LULC class in the study area with percentage coverage of 34.1% as opposed to 9% in 1986. The coverage of bare areas is also expected to increase by 53% between 2016 and 2031. Conversely, 24.9% and 68.3% loss of forestlands and wetlands respectively, are expected between 2016 and 2031. In view of the 11th goal of SDGs which focuses on achieving sustainable cities and communities, the objectives of African Union&amp;rsquo;s Agenda 2063, and based on the urban growth trends observed, the study recommends a prioritization of vertical expansion as opposed to the current horizontal urban growth trends in the study area.","",https://doi.org/10.20944/preprints202007.0560.v1,"",,

Artificial intelligence (AI) can transform the environment we live in, and cities are facing the rise of urban intelligence (UI). Mobile sensors and handheld devices, referred to as “urban tech,” allow cars, buses, bicycles, and citizens to collect data about air quality, noise pollution, and the urban environment at large. Smart urban infrastructures can address issues such as crime, environmental pollution, and public health and help improve quality of life. How will our lives change intellectually, physically, and emotionally as the Internet of things (IoT) migrates into urban environments? Twenty-first-century architecture can find new purpose by adopting a coherent vision for the future.

In this study, we extracted the built-up regions of 14 central cities in the Hunan province using the DMSP-OLS night light remote sensing datasets from 1992 to 2018, and evaluated the spatial and temporal characteristics of the built-up regions in terms of the area, expansion speed, and main expansion direction. The backpropagation (BP) neural network and autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model were used to predict the area of the built-up regions from 2019 to 2026. The model predictions were based on the GDP, ratio of the secondary industry output to the GDP, ratio of the tertiary industry output to the GDP, year-end urban population, and urban road area. The results demonstrated that the built-up area and expansion speed of the central cities in the eastern part of the Hunan province were significantly higher than those in the western part. The main expansion directions of the 14 central cities were east and south. The urban road area, year-end urban population, and GDP were the main driving factors of the expansion. The urban expansion model based on the BP neural network provided a high prediction accuracy (R = 0.966). It was estimated that the total area of urban built-up regions in the Hunan province will reach 2463.80 km2 by 2026. These findings provide a new perspective for predicting urban areas rapidly and simply, and it also provides a useful reference for studying the spatial expansion characteristics of central cities and formulating a sustainable urban development strategy during the 14th Five-Year Plan of China.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/su132111982,"",,

While the mediated impact of anthropogenic-emission restriction has not been comprehensively discussed, the lockdown response to the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) provides an unprecedented opportunity to meet this goal. This study proposes a new idea to explore the effects of urban functional fragmentation on NO 2 variation with anthropogenic-emission restriction in China. First, NO 2 variations are quantified by an Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average with external variables-Dynamic Time Warping (SARIMAX-DTW)-based model. Then, urban functional fragmentation indices including industrial/public Edge Density (ED) and Landscape Shape Index (LSI), urban functional Aggregation Index (AI) and Number of Patches (NP) are developed. Finally, the mediated impacts of anthropogenic-emission restriction are assessed by evaluating the fragmentation-NO 2 variation association before and during the lockdown during COVID-19. The findings reveal negative effects of industrial ED, public LSI, urban functional AI and NP and positive effects of public ED and industrial LSI on NO 2 variation based on the restricted anthropogenic emissions. By comparing the association analysis before and during lockdown, the mediated impact of anthropogenic-emission restriction is revealed to partially increase the effect of industrial ED, industrial LSI, public LSI, urban functional AI and NP and decrease the effect of public ED on NO 2 variation. This study provides scientific findings for redesigning the urban environment in related to the urban functional configuration to mitigating the air pollution, ultimately developing sustainable societies.","",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-91236-w,"",,

Nowadays, it is possible to connect different objects to the internet via embedded devices. By means of this technology, physical objects can share and collect data with minimal human contribution. In this inter-connected world, digital systems can record, monitor, and adjust each interaction between connected things. The IoT technologies support smart cities initiatives around the world in order to promote greener and safer urban environments, with cleaner air and water, and better public services and mobility. Smart environment is an inseparable part of smart cities. In our environment, wastes are objects that we put in the Bin. Waste management sorting and recycling are two central elements in the fight against climate change. Existing solid waste management policies and methods are being challenged by the exponential population expansion in urban areas. In fast-growing cities, where increasing garbage output exceeds the capacity of current facilities, the issue becomes even more difficult. Waste avoidance, recycling, reuse, and recovery are essential factors for reducing solid waste discharged in landfills, particularly in rapidly increasing cities where more sustainable management techniques are required.

The temporal and spatial distribution characteristics of PM2.5 concentrations have become an important research topic for sustainable social development monitoring. Based on NPP-VIIRS nighttime light images, meteorological data, and SRTM DEM data, this article builds a PM2.5 concentration estimation model for the Chang-Zhu-Tan urban agglomeration. First, the partial least squares method is used to calculate the nighttime light radiance, meteorological elements (temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed), and topographic elements (elevation, slope, and topographic undulation) for correlation analysis. Second, we construct seasonal and annual PM2.5 concentration estimation models, including multiple linear regression, support random forest, vector regression, Gaussian process regression, etc., with different factor sets. Finally, the accuracy of the PM2.5 concentration estimation model that results in the Chang-Zhu-Tan urban agglomeration is analyzed, and the spatial distribution of the PM2.5 concentration is inverted. The results show that the PM2.5 concentration correlation of meteorological elements is the strongest, and the topographic elements are the weakest. In terms of seasonal estimation, the spring estimation results of multiple linear regression and machine learning estimation models are the worst, the winter estimation results of multiple linear regression estimation models are the best, and the annual estimation results of machine learning estimation models are the best.

Urban areas account for a small fraction of the Earth's surface but have a disproportionate impact on its surroundings regarding mass, energy, and resources. An exponential increase in the urban population has been observed since the mid-20th century. As expected by the United Nations (UN), by the year 2050, 68.4% of the world population will live in cities with a population of 20,000 or more. Due to enormous socio-economic pressures resulting from population expansion, urbanization and intensive changes in the landscape, an urban development program to make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable has become of the utmost importance since the 2005 World Summit in Rio and further adopted in 2015 by UN as the ""2030 Agenda"" for Sustainable Development. The study focused on monitoring the SDG 11 target 11.3.1. they are defined as a ratio of land consumption rate to the population growth rate because mapping urban land quickly and accurately is indispensable for watershed run-off prediction and other planning applications. There is no well-established, consistent way to measure either urban land sprawl or population growth. However, remote sensing methods and satellite-derived data make it possible to monitor urban growth rates over large areas in a relatively short time. There are many techniques for urban land cover automatically mapping. These techniques can be broadly grouped into two general types: those based on the input data classification, including pixel- and object-based classifications and those based on directly segmenting the indices, such as the commonly used normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), normalized build-up area index (NDBI), and their modifications.The authors used classical pixel (supervised classification with Spectral Angle Mapper classification and KNN methods) and objectbased classification in the presented research. In addition, spectral indices, i.e., NDVI, NDBI and their modifications to derive buildup areas, were applied. Moreover, the authors focused on the recent deep learning and machine learning methods, i.e., the utilization of spatial-context information in multi-temporal data to learn hierarchical feature representations. All methods of detecting built-up areas were compared and assessed based on the available cartographic data.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/isprs-archives-xliii-b3-2022-107-2022,"",,

This coupling complicates urban planning and land use development, as changing one facet of the urban fabric will likely impact the others. As cities grapple with climate change, there is a growing need to envision urban futures that not only address more frequent and intense severe weather events but also improve day-to-day livability. Here we examine climate risks as functions of the local land use with numerical models. These models leverage a wide array of data sources, from satellite imagery to tax assessments and land cover. We then present a machine-learning cellular automata approach to combine historical land use change with local coproduced urban future scenarios. The cellular automata model uses historical and ancillary data like existing road systems and natural features to develop a set of probabilistic land use change rules, which are then modified according to stakeholder priorities. The resulting land use scenarios are evaluated against historical flood hazards, showcasing how they perform against stakeholder expectations. Our work shows that coproduced scenarios, when grounded with historical and emerging data, can provide paths that increase resilience to weather hazards as well as enhancing ecosystem services provided to citizens.","",https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-63131-4_9,"",,

The work aims to determine whether green areas are more significant in cities where above-normal wet events have plateaued. This work compares the green surface cover characteristics of the entire city and identified zones of 54 cities representing cities worldwide. These cities experience varying amounts of above-normal weather conditions. This article classifies the cities in the data set into two groups: Group 1 – frequency of extreme wet weather events has plateaued, and Group 2 – frequency of extreme weather events are increasing or decreasing at higher rates. Next, the work uses structural features of co-located spatial networks, roads and terrain, to identify zones. Finally, high-resolution satellite imagery quantified urban green spaces in the city and identified zones of the two city groups using geospatial and machine learning methods for 2000 and 2020. The data is compared for two groups to understand the pattern of green spaces in cities. Empirical analysis results recognise a higher greenness index in the zones and the entire city amongst the cities of Group1. The pattern in the temporal change in the greenness index of the zones is helpful to formulate a priority plan for locating inter-linked green spaces in urban areas paving the way for Nature-based Solutions. The findings can guide planners and policy-makers to identify and prioritise locations to incorporate a robust green infrastructure network to build resilient cities by 'nature bringing a solution', the essential concept of Nature-based Solutions.","",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nbsj.2021.100008,"",,

The increased availability of such data enables people and their interactions with the physical environment to be analysed and understood within the context of complex urban systems. It also has the potential to be used for evidence-based urban planning and management. However, problems such as congestion and air pollution continue to happen as results of high car-dependency in many cities. To overcome the challenges, sustainable modes of transportation such as cycling is (re)emerging through bike-sharing schemes as an increasingly common response. Analysing flow interactions is key to promoting and developing sustainable and integrated transportation systems in cities. 
This study has aimed to better understand and model dynamics within sustainable urban transport systems through spatiotemporal and novel graph-based analysis. Large quantities of travel flows in different and newly emerged (e.g.dockless) bike-sharing schemes are investigated with high spatial and temporal granularity at the individual level. Weekly, daily and hourly graph structures are modelled to uncover and quantify how travel behaviours are impacted by the built environment, by changes in transportation systems, and as a result of events that disrupt the normal patterns of movement. The revealed mobility patterns and graph structural changes indicate underlying urban resilience, where individuals can rapidly adopt bike-sharing to fill transit gaps that emerged. Furthermore, this thesis, for the first time, quantifies the utility of temporal graph indices for enhancing machine learning models to making predictions on dynamics and demand in urban traffic systems. This research has great potential to help improve transport management and planning in urban areas.","",,"",,

These effects can be mitigated by common engineering practices, such as Low Impact Development (LID, which generally involves stormwater treatment devices on a smaller scale rather than centralized solutions); Sustainable Urban Drainage Systems (SUDSs, a range of technologies and techniques used to drain stormwater in a more sustainable manner than conventional solutions); Best Management Practices (BMPs, suggested solutions are more focalized on pollution prevention in urban systems), and more. Among the proposed solutions, detention/retention systems and stormwater ponds can also perform excellent functions with regard to hydraulic hazards and both quantitative and qualitative control of sewer discharge, thanks to stormwater volume accumulation together with the presence of vegetation, when the basin is conceived as a natural-looking lake environment. The use of data-driven approaches could represent an effective approach for the prediction of the characteristics of the sewage tributaries, for the generation of synthetic time series of quantitative/qualitative data of sewer flows or for Real-Time Control (RTC) to reduce overflow at the Waste Water Treatment Plant (WWTP). This work shows the preliminary results obtained by applying NARX neural networks in order to estimate quality indices (the turbidity in this study) in sewer systems. The available data are discharge, temperature, gage height, specific conductivity, and precipitation, whose use as parameters for the recurrent neural network leads to values of R = 0.77–0.80 in the various combinations tested.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/environsciproc2022021067,"",,

Land-use changes from 2000 to 2035 were simulated and projected under the current trend scenario (CTS), economic development scenario (EDS) and ecological protection scenario (EPS) in the Heihe River Basin, while the RSEI was predicted using the elastic net regression (machine learning method); finally, the predicted results were synthesized and analyzed. The results showed that forest, grassland and water were positively correlated with ecological quality, with the green space coverage under the CTS, EPS and EDS accounting for 34.15%, 70.65% and 34.72% of the total transferred land area, respectively. The increase in the area of build-up land and unutilized land was detrimental to ecological quality, with the area of building land in the EDS being 1.75 times larger than in the year 2000. The EDS contributes to the sustainable development of the upstream area and the EPS is more conducive to the midstream and downstream areas by limiting the expansion of build-up land and by developing unutilized land in a limited way to increase the area of green space after reconciling economic conditions. Projection results promote the rational allocation of various land-use types in the future (semi) arid region, such as artificial forestation, unutilized land development and restriction of urban expansion, and also lay the foundation for the formulation of policies such as water allocation and ecological protection to facilitate the sustainable development of regional society, economy and ecology.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/su14052716,"",,

This study introduced several feasible energy-efficient and environmental-friendly materials and methods, including roof gardening, advanced and recycled materials, green interior decoration, and simulation optimisation measures. Roof gardening is a kind of promising roof form that makes the functions of purifying air quality, energy conserving, and reshape the urban ecosystems all possible. However, the market still needs more encouragement from the government to better implementation in the city. Advanced materials and waste reuse materials are two key aspects of green building materials in energy saving and environment protection. The advanced material of photocatalytic self-cleaning glass has been fully applied; However, TiO2 self-cleaning glass and waste reuse materials such as rubber, straw, bamboo have some degrees of limitations due to economic and distribution constraints. The interior decoration combined with environmentally friendly materials is of great significance to enhance energy usage and environmental quality. Some new environmental protection inventions such as LED lights and artificial intelligence technologies are the main development direction in interior decoration in the future. Utilizing computer simulation and optimisation to minimize the building life cycle environmental impacts has also gained increasing attentions recently. Regarding design optimisation, emerging digital technologies (e.g., neural network, data-driven design and parametric 3D modelling, multi-disciplinary optimisation) are enablers for greater automation in early design exploration and should be encouraged in sustainable design optimisation.","",https://doi.org/10.1109/icecem54757.2021.00075,"",,

Therefore, this study simulated and predicted the spatiotemporal changes in urban economy and ecosystem service value (E.S.V.) equivalent ratio under the current policies by 2030, and analysed how adjusting planning policies influences economy and ecology. This process was based on the future land use simulation (F.L.U.S.) model of coupled neural network, and on methods assessing the spatial changes in ecosystem services and land economy. This study aims to analyse urban land economy and E.S.V., and assess how China's land spatial planning guides and promotes high-quality urban economic development. Results show that artificial intelligence (A.I.) simulation can forecast the results of spatial planning policies of national lands, to make policy-making more forward-looking. The guidance of planning policies on urban expansion accelerates the increase in economic value of urban residential and commercial lands, thereby promoting the economic growth. However, adjusted planning policies may lead to ecological destruction. So, this study provides model verifications and path guidance to realise coordinated sustainable development between economy and ecology, serving as an important reference to formulating proper policies for urban development.","",https://doi.org/10.1080/1331677x.2022.2097112,"",,
rayyan-210781734,Application of Association Rules and an Artificial Neural Network to Predict the Urban Development of Regional Revitalization,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"With the decrease in Taiwan’s total population and its dense concentration in metropolises, an imbalance between urban and rural development has emerged. Meanwhile, regional revitalization (RR) and the regeneration of local industries have been considered sustainable methods for regional development. However, a complete evaluation system is still needed to determine suitable directions and models for RR projects. Based on successful RR projects and indicators of the RR database in Taiwan, this study categorizes 55 projects into four types of RR. The association rules method is adopted to explore the relationship between the indicators and the RR types. Subsequently, an artificial neural network (ANN) model is developed to predict the future adoption of revitalization development. The results confirm that the characteristics of different regions are closely related to RR development. On the other hand, the findings reveal that the ANN model can verify the prediction accuracy of future RR models. This study also proposes a double-diamond framework to evaluate and improve the prediction of RR development, which is expected to help the government develop plans and devise strategies in different regions in the future.","",https://doi.org/10.1061/(asce)up.1943-5444.0000876,"",,

This not only puts tremendous pressure on the limited resources of these urban centres but also is a challenging conundrum for all the agencies involved in urban planning. This chaotic scenario is further worsened as this migratory population vies for jobs, houses, civic amenities etc. with the urban population. These urban centres by virtue of their infrastructure, and geographical location become drivers of growth for any nation; therefore, it becomes important that these are efficiently managed and their meagre space and resources are optimally utilized. Self-sustainable ""Smart Cities"" are therefore the necessity of the future, in which technologies like Information and Communication Technology (ICT), Internet of Things (IoT), and Artificial Intelligence (AI) will substantially reduce human intervention in daily functioning of these cities and will form the basic framework for near autonomous management of services like health care, transport, infrastructure planning, power supply, law and order, tourism, immovable assets management, disaster management and sustainability issues, viz waste recycling.","",https://doi.org/10.1201/9781003009139-8,"",,

Climate change, rapid urbanization, and unplanned disaster management further increase trends of urban floods with higher frequency and intensity. This study employs data-driven machine learning (ML) models for predicting the flooding susceptibility of public transit systems in Toronto, ON, Canada. Four ML approaches are employed to evaluate the future risks of public transit systems being inundated by flooding events: 1) Random Forest (RF); 2) eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost); 3) K Nearest Neighbor (KNN); and 4) Naïve Bayes (NB). We estimate flooding probability based on the relationship between flood inundation events and their contributing factors. Flood-plain maps by Toronto and Region Conservation Authority (TRCA) are used to generate flood and non-flood locations as a basis for training (70% of samples) and validating (30% of samples) ML models. We use the Area-Under Receiver Operating Characteristic (AUROC) curve to evaluate the prediction results of ML models. All four models show a high level of accuracy higher than 95%. Our results demonstrate public transit systems near major river channels are highly susceptible to floods which corroborated with historical flooding incidents in 2013 and 2018. The outcome of the study can be helpful to enhance the resilience of public transit systems in the city of Toronto and can facilitate evidence-based planning and policy to make cities more sustainable, livable, and resilient against flood hazards.","",https://doi.org/10.1145/3486626.3493438,"",,

The goal of this research is to create a strategy that enables the extraction of indicators from large-scale orthoimages of different resolution with practically acceptable accuracy after a short training process. Remote sensing data can be used to detect changes in number of buildings, forest areas, and other landscape objects. In this paper, aerial images of a digital raster orthophoto map at scale 1:10,000 of the Republic of Lithuania (ORT10LT) of three periods (2009–2010, 2012–2013, 2015–2017) were analyzed. Because of the developing technologies, the quality of the images differs significantly and should be taken into account while preparing the dataset for training the semantic segmentation model DeepLabv3 with a ResNet50 backbone. In the data preparation step, normalization techniques were used to ensure stability of image quality and contrast. Focal loss for the training metric was selected to deal with the misbalanced dataset. The suggested model training process is based on the transfer learning technique and combines using a model with weights pretrained in ImageNet with learning on coarse and fine-tuning datasets. The coarse dataset consists of images with classes generated automatically from Open Street Map (OSM) data and the fine-tuning dataset was created by manually reviewing the images to ensure that the objects in images match the labels. To highlight the benefits of transfer learning, six different models were trained by combining different steps of the suggested model training process. It is demonstrated that using pretrained weights results in improved performance of the model and the best performance was demonstrated by the model which includes all three steps of the training process (pretrained weights, training on coarse and fine-tuning datasets). Finally, the results obtained with the created machine learning model enable the implementation of different approaches to detect, analyze, and interpret urban changes for policymakers and investors on different levels on a local map, grid, or municipality level.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/ijgi11040246,"",,

The dynamic changes in the urban area can reflect the urban expansion process and spatial development model. Carrying out urban expansion monitoring and extracting urban areas is of great importance for grasping the law of urban development and promoting the sustainable development of cities. However, the related research reveals several problems such as insufficient accuracy and low intelligence of urban boundary extraction. In response to these problems, this paper proposes a new method for urban area extraction based on the progressive learning model. By combining prior knowledge and image features, the number of training samples required for machine learning is reduced, and the problem of using high-level semantic information expression in the process of urban areas is avoided by using the classification method, and thus the accuracy of urban area extraction is improved. The method uses urban road network data to divide the city into blocks. It applies the scene classification method to extract the urban areas and uses the pyramid layer-by-layer to carry out the space constraint method to integrate the urban extraction principle into the machine learning process, which can be obtained and kept artificial under a small sample condition. Extracting the effect of the urban area is very close, greatly reducing the workload and providing a new solution for high-precision automatic extraction of urban areas. Through the analysis of urban expansion, the following results were obtained: (1) from 2000 to 2015, China's provincial capital cities maintained a high-speed growth trend with a total area increased by 90%; (2) urban expansion showed significant regional differences. The eastern expansion rate gradually slowed down, the western and northeast regions accelerated their expansion, and the central region expanded steadily; (3) 61% of the provincial capital cities expanded exponentially; (4) the development of China's provincial capital cities was highly correlated with national urban development policies and regional development strategies.","",https://doi.org/10.14358/pers.22-00017r2,"",,

Waste management sorting and recycling are two central elements in the fight against climate change. Existing solid waste management policies and methods are being challenged by the exponential population expansion in urban areas. In fast-growing cities, where increasing garbage output exceeds the capacity of current facilities, the issue becomes even more difficult.

The actual environmental performance of urban centres is difficult to predict due to the complex interplay of technologies and infrastructure with social, economic, and political factors. Machine learning (ML) techniques can be used to detect patterns in high-level city data to determine factors that influence favourable climate performance. In this work, rough set-based ML (RSML) is used to identify such patterns in the Sustainable Cities Index (SCI), which ranks 100 of the world’s major urban centres based on three broad criteria that cover social, environmental, and economic dimensions. These main criteria are further broken down into 18 detailed criteria that are used to calculate the aggregate SCI scores of the listed cities. Two of the environmental criteria measure energy intensity and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. RSML is used to generate interpretable rule-based (if/then) models that predict energy utilisation and GHG emissions performance of cities based on the other criteria in the database. Attribute reduction techniques are used to identify a set of 7 non-redundant criteria for energy use and 9 non-redundant criteria for GHG emissions; 6 criteria are common to these two sets. Then, RSML is used to generate rule-based models. A 10-rule model is determined for energy intensity, while an 11-rule model is found for GHG emissions. Both models were reduced further by eliminating rules with weak generalisation capability. A key insight from the rule-based models is that social, environmental, and economic attributes are associated with energy intensity and GHG emissions due to indirect effects.","",https://doi.org/10.3303/cet2188067,"",,

rayyan-210781775,Flood risk dynamics and adaptation analyses for coastal cities based on internet big data and hydrology-hydrodynamic models,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"<p indent=0mm>Climate change, sea-level rise, land subsidence, and rapid urbanization are likely to increase flood risk in low-lying coastal cities in the future, posing serious challenges to urban sustainability. To quantitatively assess the future trends of flood risks and to carry out effective adaptation measures are among the hot topics for flood risk management. A sound answer needs fine-scale data to support an integrative analysis of hydrology-hydrodynamic processes, socio-economic impacts, and adaptation measures. In this regard, this paper puts forward a set of multidisciplinary and comprehensive methods to address the frontier scientific issues. First, internet big data and machine learning methods were adopted to map the building footprint, height, and its economic values, providing a fine-scale spatial and economic information of elements at risk. The residential building footprint was mapped with an accuracy of 92.8%, and the housing price was derived via web crawler from different online real estate websites. Second, the hydrology-hydrodynamic models of TOMAWAC, TELEMAC and MIKE 1D/2D were integrated to simulate four storm-surge flooding scenarios. The scenarios are based on the real Typhoon event TC9711 on August 18, 1997, whereby the wind, wave, tide, 1D flood, and 2D flood processes are simulated and flood scenarios of four different return periods are extrapolated. Especially, for future scenarios in 2050, sea level rise and land subsidence are also considered. Third, the expected annual damage (EAD) is estimated via risk analysis technique with combination of flood maps in the four return periods and the fine-scale exposure data. Finally, a cost-benefit analysis was done to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of two flood adaptation measures, i.e., dry flood-proofing and wet flood-proofing measures, for residential buildings. Taking Shanghai as an example, the above methods were applied to comprehensively assess the storm-caused flood risk of residential buildings, its future trends to 2050, and the costs and benefits of two adaptation measures. The results show that: (1) Sea-level rise and land subsidence will significantly exacerbate the flood risks in Shanghai. (2) Under the three Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP4.5, RCP8.5 and RCP8.5 High-end), the area of exposed residential buildings in Shanghai by 2050 may reach <sc>31−49 km<sup>2</sup></sc> (4%–6% of total building area) for a 1/200-year storm flood event and <sc>180–206 km<sup>2</sup></sc> (14%–16%) for a 1/5000-year event. (3) The EAD of residential buildings in 2017 is 440 million CNY (65.4 million USD), which can increase 1.6–2.0 times and reach to CNY 700 million–900 million (104.0 million–133.8 million USD) in 2050. (4) The implementation of both dry and wet flood-proofing measures could potentially reduce the EAD by 76%–79% and 88%–90%, respectively. Both measures are considerably cost-effective: the net present values of dry and wet flood-proofing measures are 2.84 billion–5.53 billion CNY (0.4 billion–0.8 billion USD) and 5.85 billion–9.94 billion CNY (0.9 billion–1.5 billion USD), and the benefit/cost ratios are 1.9–2.4 and 7.9–9.8 respectively. This indicates that the cost-effectiveness of dry flood-proofing measures is less than that of wet measure. Our findings can provide both scientific understanding and effective adaptation measures for mitigating the future flood risk in Shanghai. These multidisciplinary methods could also be applied to assess flood risk and adaptation strategies in other coastal cities.","",https://doi.org/10.1360/tb-2020-1536,"",,
rayyan-210781779,Mining Points-of-Interest Data to Predict Urban Inequality: Evidence from Germany and France,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Reducing inequality is a major goal of the Sustainable Development Goals. Inequality is many-sided and often appears across geographic boundaries. Urban inequality refers to inequality between urban neighborhoods. Despite close distances, it reveals considerable disparities in income level, unemployment rates, and other socio-economic indicators and is highly dangerous for democratic societies. However, little is known about determinants indicating urban inequality. Here, we propose to explain urban inequality based on point-of-interest (POI) data from the online platform Open Street Maps. For this, we leverage machine learning to predict three major indicators of urban inequality, namely, unemployment rate, income level, and foreign national rate. We evaluate our machine learning approach using POI data for neighborhoods in Paris, Lyon, Marseille, Berlin, Hamburg, and Bremen. We find: (1) POIs are highly predictive of intra-city inequality explaining up to 75% of out-of-sample variance of urban inequality. (2) POIs generalize across cities and, thereby, can help to explain urban inequality in other cities, where no socio-economic data is available. (3) Important POIs for the prediction model are, e.g., banks and playgrounds. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to show urban inequality through POIs. As such, POIs can be used to infer granular mappings of urban inequality and thereby provide cost-effective evidence for policy-makers.","",https://doi.org/10.1609/icwsm.v16i1.19286,"",,

To adapt cities for modern faculties, regular monitoring of developing infrastructures is essential. The built-up land use map derived from remote sensing images shows how cities expand horizontally across the landscape as they grow over decades. Recent studies have shown that when planning for a more sustainable future in metropolitan settings, adding vertical components in the computation of built-up is beneficial for better understanding. As illustrated in this paper, the built-up area of an urban region is extracted from high-resolution LISS IV satellite sensor image data using deep learning techniques. The height of an urban built-up is estimated from Cartosat-1 stereo images using photogrammetric methods and automatic terrain extraction. This study combines the use of a deep learning model with the use of high-resolution remote sensing data to extract the urban built up volume. The results demonstrate that the western and northwestern areas of the study region see greater changes in urban volume compared to the central business district and other parts of the city. This work demonstrates a step-by-step strategy for studying urban growth patterns. It helps in understanding urban growth, population mobility patterns, societal typology, environmental indicators.

Though making significant towards the maximum possible use of clean, renewable forms of energy, such as hydro, thermal, solar and wind power, it will be a long time yet before China can completely abandon the use of fossil fuels. . In this paper, using Fuyang City in Anhui Province as a case study, a four-dimensional differential equation model, based on the consumption, price, economic growth, and ""ecological civilization construction"" of natural gas energy, is developed which incorporates concepts and calculations of natural gas energy intensity, ""natural gas ecological civilization intensity"", and ""economic ecological civilization intensity"". It is the first attempt ever made to quantify the construction of urban ecological civilization and discuss the evolutionary relationship among the internal variables of the system . Regression analysis, data fitting, neural network, and other methods are used to confirm the parameters of the system model. Through Matlab simulation of each variable and using an evolution map, a quantitative understanding of the role of natural gas is generated. The research findings reveal that paying attention to the environmental aspects of energy consumption is beneficial to economic growth. The paper concludes that, at present, the best ways for China to reduce its carbon emissions are to implement a market price and peak–valley prices for natural gas, improve the tiered price mechanism, appropriately reduce the economic growth rate, continue to adjust the industrial structure away from heavy industry and scientifically manage the natural gas energy system. These reforms are of great practical significance in working towards a sustainable development path for the city.","",https://doi.org/10.3389/fenrg.2019.00147,"",,
rayyan-210781793,An artificial intelligence approach for identifying efficient urban forest indicators on ecosystem service assessment,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Urban trees provide multiple ecosystem services (ES) to city residents and are used as environmentally friendly solutions to ameliorate problems in cities worldwide. Effective urban forestry management is essential for enhancing ES, but challenging to develop in densely populated cities where tradeoffs between high ES provision and issues of periodic disaster-caused risks or maintenance costs must be balanced. With the aim of providing practical guidelines to promote green cities, this study developed an AI-based analytical approach to systematically evaluate tree conditions and detect management problems. By using a self-organizing map technique with a big dataset of Taipei street trees, we integrated the ES values estimated by i-Tree Eco to tree attributes of DBH, height, leaf area, and leaf area index (LAI) to comprehensively assess their complex relationship and interlinkage. We found that DBH and leaf area are good indicators for the provision of ES, allowing us to quantify the potential loss and tradeoffs by cross-checking with tree height and the correspondent ES values. In contrast, LAI is less effective in estimating ES than DBH and leaf area, but is useful as a supplementary one. We developed a detailed lookup table by compiling the tree datasets to assist the practitioners with a rapid assessment of tree conditions and associated loss of ES values. This analytical approach provides accessible, science-based information to appraise the right species, criteria, and place for landscape design. It gives explicit references and guidelines to help detect problems and guide directions for improving the ES and the sustainability of urban forests.","",https://doi.org/10.3389/fenvs.2022.994389,"",,

Most of the sea bays have suffered severe eutrophication, water quality deterioration, ecosystem degradation and other problems. Although many countries and local governments have carried out corresponding environmental protection actions, the evaluation of their effectiveness still requires monitoring technology and data support for long-term water environment change. In this study, we take Yueqing Bay, the fourth largest bay in China, as a case to study the satellite-based water quality monitoring and variation analysis. We established a nutrient retrieval model for Yueqing Bay to produce a long-term series of nutrient concentration products in Yueqing Bay from 2013 to 2020, based on Landsat remote sensing images and long-term observation data, combined with support vector machine learning and water temperature and satellite spectra as input parameters, and then we analyzed its spatiotemporal variations and driving factors. In general, nutrient concentrations in the western part of the bay were higher than those in the eastern part. Levels of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) were lower in summer than in spring and winter, and reactive phosphate (PO4-P) levels were lower in summer and higher in autumn. In terms of natural factors, physical effects (e.g., seasonal variations in flow field) and biological effects (e.g., seasonal differences in the intensity of plankton photosynthesis) were the main causes of seasonal differences in nutrient concentration in Yueqing Bay. Nutrient concentration generally increased from 2013 to 2015 but decreased slightly after 2015. Over the past decade, the economy and industry of Yueqing Bay basin have developed rapidly. Wastewater resulting from anthropogenic production and consumption was transported via streams into Yueqing Bay, leading to the continuous increase in nutrient concentrations (the variation rates: aDIN&gt;0, aPO4−P&gt;0), which directly or indirectly caused high nutrient concentrations in some areas of the bay (e.g., Southwest Shoal at the mouth of Yueqing Bay). After 2015, the various ecological remediation policies adopted by cities around Yueqing Bay have mitigated, to some extent, the increasing nutrient concentration trends (the variation rates: aDIN&lt;0, aPO4−P&lt;0), but not significantly (P &gt; 0.1). The environmental restoration of Yueqing Bay also requires continuous and long-term ecological protection and restoration work to be effective.

Population growth continues to increase every year. It is recorded that in 2022 the world population will reach 7,953,952,567 or an increase of 1% from 2021. The increasing number of residents encourages land use/land cover changes to become settlements. In addition to changes in land use/land cover, there is also population mobilization from one place to another. This population movement will coincide with developments that will occur in the area. Monitoring population distribution is necessary to have no concentration in only one area. Areas with too dense a population will cause many problems such as the emergence of slum buildings, congestion, and flooding. In this case, the population density is centralized due to poor regional planning. The absence of prediction of future population distribution is one of the reasons why urban planning in the future is not optimal. This study aims to predict the distribution of the population in 2030. In predicting the distribution of population in 2030, it integrates the prediction of land use/land cover in 2030 with the prediction of the population in 2030. In predicting land use/land in 2030, land use/land in 2005 and 2010 is used as the primary data for change prediction. The method used to predict changes in land use/land cover is the CA-ANN method by considering the driving factors of changes in the form of altitude, distance from the river, and distance from the road. Predicting the population of 2030 will be done by extrapolation using the three mathematical equations approach, they are linear, exponential, and power equation. The results of the prediction of land use/land and population in 2030 are then used to predict the population distribution in 2030. From the results, In the 2030 there was an increase in the class of settlements which reached an area of 745,169 Km2 with the overall accuracy of the land cover model reached 82%. The largest population projection come from exponential equation that until 13024668 in 2030. The model population distribution in 2030, show that there is no significant different between three projection model to be used in model population distribution 2030.

Specifically, we focus on the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) and the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. We construct a two-period panel of 66 Territorial Authorities (TAs) of New Zealand (NZ) observed in 2008-09 and 2020-21. We find that, despite the totally different nature of the two shocks, the initial increase in benefit uptake due to the COVID-19 pandemic was of a similar magnitude as that of the GFC, and the spatial pattern was also quite similar. We link the social security data with 146 indicator variables across 15 domains that were obtained from population censuses that were held two years before each of the two periods. To identify urban characteristics that point to economic resilience, we formulate spatial panel regression models. Additionally, we use machine learning techniques. We find that the most resilient TAs had two years previously: (1) a low unemployment rate; and (2) a large public sector. Additionally, but with less predictive power, we find that TAs had a smaller increase in social security uptake after the shock when they had previously: (3) a high employment rate (or high female labour force participation rate); (4) a smaller proportion of the population stating ethnicities other than NZ European; (5) a smaller proportion of the population living in more deprived area units.

Inspired by image generation, deep urban planning aims to leverage deep learning to generate land-use configurations. However, urban planning is a complex process. Existing studies usually ignore the need of personalized human guidance in planning, and spatial hierarchical structure in planning generation. Moreover, the lack of large-scale land-use configuration samples poses a data sparsity challenge. This paper studies a novel deep human guided urban planning method to jointly solve the above challenges. Specifically, we formulate the problem into a deep conditional variational autoencoder based framework. In this framework, we exploit the deep encoder-decoder design to generate land-use configurations. To capture the spatial hierarchy structure of land uses, we enforce the decoder to generate both the coarse-grained layer of functional zones, and the fine-grained layer of POI distributions. To integrate human guidance, we allow humans to describe what they need as texts and use these texts as a model condition input. To mitigate training data sparsity and improve model robustness, we introduce a variational Gaussian embedding mechanism. It not just allows us to better approximate the embedding space distribution of training data and sample a larger population to overcome sparsity, but also adds more probabilistic randomness into the urban planning generation to improve embedding diversity so as to improve robustness. Finally, we present extensive experiments to validate the enhanced performances of our method.","",https://doi.org/10.1109/icdm51629.2021.00079,"",,

For the impact of traffic on land use, the concepts of vitality and potential are introduced, and a multidimensional long and short-term memory network (MDLSTM) model is established. The model takes into account land use lags and potential transfer and has relatively higher prediction accuracy. The results show that larger cities with urban dominant industries and tertiary industries also have higher land use potential and the more significantly influenced by traffic.","",https://doi.org/10.1155/2022/2727512,"",,

Researchers came forward with water resource management framework considering quantity and quality of water resource, use pattern, wastewater generation, and its reuse, but this framework was limited to water supply and wastewater infrastructures i.e., the physical characteristics of urban water cycle. However, the inter-dependencies, complexities and uncertainties of the water environments made the problem unsolved due to unavailability of generic model or any single sufficient method to address the issues of urban water sub-basin. Therefore, urban water sustainability can be seen as a rigorous complex computational task for which artificial intelligence approaches may play a vital role to establish inter-relationship among various measures within the frameworks. Agent-based modelling may be a game changer in water development for existing and future water related activities in an urban setup. ABMs have potential to model water stakeholders and their interactions based on their authorities and behavioural rules with complexities of the system. As a result, an agent-based IUWM framework including UN-SDG-6, with complex behavioural rules and environmental uncertainties may be an efficient approach to achieve sustainable urban water management.","",https://doi.org/10.1201/9781003203445-15,"",,

Accurate and updated mapping of urban expansions is curtail in urban and territorial planning for sustainable and strategic urban development. Using Earth Observation (EO) technologies, classification of urban areas in a rural landscape is more challenging than big cities. In this regard, in this paper, we aim at assessing the integration of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellite data for classifying small urban areas in rural landscape in Google Earth Engine (GEE). Images of close dates from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 were selected, preprocessed, and integrated to develop a machine learning classification through a Support Vector Classification (SVM) classifier. We have also added vegetation indices to the investigated dataset. As a study area, two rural areas in the Republic of North Macedonia has been selected. The results showed that the integration of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 performed better than Sentinel-2 alone, with accuracy higher than 90%. For future studies, we recommend testing the dataset to different study areas and adding different EO data for obtaining even higher accuracy.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/iecg2020-08542,"",,
rayyan-210781902,GEOSCENE MODELING AND ANALYSIS FOR URBAN FUNCTIONAL ZONES,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract. Urban functional zones are basic units for human socio-economic activities in cities. Urban functional zones play an important role in a wide range of urban studies, as they are fundamental to urban planning and management, urban resource allocation, as well as urban sustainable development evaluation. However, existing studies of urban functional zone modeling and mapping mainly employ state-of-the-art image segmentation and deep learning classification methods in computer science field to delineate and recognize urban functional zones, but ignore their heterogeneity, integration, multi-scale, and locality characteristics, so that the accuracy of urban functional zone modeling, mapping, and analysis is limited and interpretable, thus cannot comprehensively meet the requirements of downstream applications. This study, however, proposes a geoscene modeling and analysis framework for extracting urban functional zones, which first delineates urban functional zones by multiscale geoscene segmentation, then characterizes them by hierarchical semantic cognition, and finally recognizes their functional categories by linear Dirichlet mixture model. Although this paper does not present the detailed implementations of the geoscene modeling of urban functional zones, it illustrates the importance and the generally strategy of geoscene modeling in urban functional zone mapping and analysis. Additionally, urban functional zone mapping results of Baoshan District, Shanghai, in 2015 and 2020 are presented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed geoscene modeling strategy.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/isprs-archives-xlviii-3-w2-2022-91-2022,"",,

However, only few studies stressed the importance of data techniques in understanding urban sustainability, especially urban forest landscape. Therefore, this study makes an analysis of urban forest resources in a city of Yangtze River Delta with the help of multi-source data techniques and further data analysis of different forest landscape pattern indices in the study area with the help of SPSS (Statistical Product and Service Solutions). The following conclusions are drawn: 1) According to the visual analysis, the spatial distribution of forest patches in the study area has a great difference. 2) All the seven landscape pattern indices are positively correlated with the distribution density of POI (Point of Interest), which represents the urban economic vitality. The correlation coefficients are NP (R 2 = 0.3063), PD (R 2 = 0.0079), ED (R 2 = 0.3955), AREA (R 2 = 0.5408), CONTIG (R 2 = 0.0323), PAFRAC (R 2 = 0.3662) and AI (R 2 = 0.2014), respectively. This indicates that the higher the economic vitality is, the more fragmented and complex the urban forest patches are. 3) According to the geographically weighted regression model, the goodness of fit between the spatial distribution density of POI and NP, PD, ED, and AI reaches 0.804, 0.771, 0.634, and 0.619, respectively, and the explanatory power of the model is more than twice that of the corresponding linear regression model.

In this study, we employ a mobile monitoring method to collect PM2.5 and BC data in the city of Philadelphia, PA during the summer of 2019 and apply the Structure of Urban Landscapes (STURLA) methodology to examine relationships between urban structure and atmospheric pollution. We find that, while PM2.5 and BC vary by STURLA class, many of the differences in pollutant concentrations between classes are not significant. However, we also find that the proportions in which STURLA components are present throughout the urban landscape can be used to predict urban air pollution. Among frequently sampled STURLA classes, gpl hosted the highest PM2.5 concentrations on average (16.60 &amp;plusmn; 4.29 &amp;micro;g/m3), while tgbwp hosted the highest BC concentrations (2.31 &amp;plusmn; 1.94 &amp;micro;g/m3). Furthermore, STURLA combined with machine learning modeling was able to correlate PM2.5 (R2= 0.68, RMSE 2.82 &amp;micro;g/m3) and BC (R2 = 0.64, RMSE 0.75 &amp;micro;g/m3) concentrations with the urban landscape and spatially interpolate concentrations where sampling did not take place.

With this uptick in persons with dementia (PWD), managing dementia-induced agitation, a behavior present in 90 precent of PWD characterized by physical aggression, verbal outburst, or other troubling behavior, is a pressing issue [1]. Caregiver burden associated with agitation is one of the leading causes a community-based PWD is institutionalized [2], so by supporting PWD-caregiver dyads, we improve individual quality of life and relieve stress placed on the global healthcare system. Use of AI technology, big data, and integrated networks of wearable and ambient sensors has enabled continuous monitoring of dementia care. However, most methods focus on data collection at the early stages of dementia. More research is needed on how novel technologies can empower PWD and their caregivers to take action to manage agitation and support them in the long term as symptoms progress. Moreover, current methods have not taken full advantage of the information obtained and do not provide personalized care. In this paper, we use the Universal Village (UV) perspective to evaluate the current status of smart technologies with the potential for use in preventing and mitigating agitation while providing support to the caregiver. We conduct evaluations based on the framework of a closed feedback control loop: data acquisition, communication, decision making, and action. We propose that a robust PWD agitation management system should take into consideration the interaction between the smart healthcare system and other seven smart city subsystems: smart home, intelligent transportation, urban planning and crowd management, smart energy management, smart city infrastructure, smart response system for city emergency, smart environmental protection and smart humanity, and also study how managing agitation would be affected by four major impacting factors of smart cities: information flow, material cycle, lifestyle, and community. This systematic study will help us explore in depth the complicated dynamic relationship between multiple impacting factors and propose a UV-oriented, integrated, resilient, inclusive, and sustainable development framework design. As such, the novel framework will improve PWD quality of life and reduce the care burden for formal and informal caregivers through continuous, unobtrusive monitoring, life-long agitation management throughout different stages of dementia, PWD-caregiver dyad-specific guidance, preventive healthcare, and timely treatment.","",https://doi.org/10.1109/uv56588.2022.10185497,"",,

Spatio-temporal changes and driving force analysis of wetlands in Jiaozhou Bay. Journal of Coastal Research, 38(2), 328–344. Coconut Creek (Florida), ISSN 0749-0208. Jiaozhou Bay is the largest bay-type coastal wetland with high biodiversity in Shandong Peninsula. In recent years, the wetland of Jiaozhou Bay has been reduced dramatically due to urban expansion. It is significant to study the characteristics and causes of the wetland changes in the past 40 years for the rational exploitation and sustainable development of coastal wetland resources. The types, spatial distribution, and area information of the wetland from 1983 to 2019 are obtained by artificial visual interpretation and supervised classification using ten Landsat remote sensing images, assisted by Google images. The research analyzes the conversion of land use types and the change rule of landscape pattern in the wetland, as well as the driving forces of the wetland evolution and the uncertainty factors affecting the analysis results. The results indicate that the wetland area shows an overall decreasing trend from 1983 to 2019, 77% of which are converted into nonwetland. The wetland area increases initially, followed by a decrease from 1990 to 2000, but then continues to decrease slowly from 2000 to 2019. There are many types of land use changes from coastal tidal flats to other land use types such as construction land or pond, and the landscape pattern has been gradually fragmented. The continuous increase in temperature is the main natural cause for the degradation of the wetland. Population factor is the most important driving force for the change of the wetland. The main uncertain factors affecting the analysis results are the capture time of remote sensing image, tidal level correction, wetland classification system, and method. The results provide a basis for the decision-making of wetland protection. The quantitative data will provide a reference for the construction of a multiyear wetland dataset in Jiaozhou Bay.","",https://doi.org/10.2112/jcoastres-d-21-00075.1,"",,
rayyan-210781936,The Role of Creative Placemaking,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Introduction The evolution of creative city paradigm in the last three decades has dramatically changed the notion of placemaking and the meaning of art and design for urban development in the creative and cultural economy context. Very recently, a spontaneously emerging art district has been exploited by policy actions in many cities, resulting in its presence on the global stage at the UNESCO Creative City Network. The two most common approaches that drive art and design-based development policies are seen in the creative city approach and community development approach (Evans; Murdoch III et al.). The creative city approach aims to contribute to economic development by focussing on the economic role of art and design (Florida; Murdoch III et al.). The community development approach, on the other hand, is seen as an important factor for social benefit and democratic development (Murdoch III et al.; Grodach; Markusen and Gadwa). Grassroots arts movements and community arts organisations, in the community development approach, support the arts as a low-income community involvement and development initiative (Murdoch III et al.). According to Grodach, public spaces and art and design spaces have three main roles in community development, and are built on local assets to increase community engagement, interaction, and participation. Despite the vast range of economic considerations in the current literature, it remains unclear how creative placemaking through arts, crafts, and design operates in the context of creative cities. Particularly, there is a need for a more comprehensive perspective of how creative placemaking contributes to art district development. Economic competition among creative cities has increased, especially since neoliberal policies diffused to the urban agenda. The city of Izmir, located in the Aegean coast of Turkey, being one of the world's top 130 cities (Tekeli), contributes to globalisation of the region and occupies a unique position in Turkey’s democratic history. Regarding the global arena, Izmir has reformulated its governmental structure in the making of places, with particular neighbourhoods seeking to increase their attractiveness to the creative class, support the creative industries, and to become a ‘Creative City’. Since the Culture and Art Workshop in 2009, when the Izmir Metropolitan Municipality established a creative city vision to serve as a high point in a democratic era, in particular involving elements of culture and creativity of importance for local and global actors, there has been a series of programs with different design strategies and governance mechanisms, such as the design projects (e.g. Izmir Sea Project and Izmir History Project, and History Design Workshop), formations (e.g. establishment of Izmir Mediterranean Academy with branches of history, design, ecology, culture, and arts in 2013), events and organisations (e.g. Good Design Izmir in 2016, 5th World Design Talks by the World Design Organization [WDO] in 2018), and applications for candidacy (e.g. for the World Design Capital title 2020, and UNESCO Creative Cities Network in 2019). The purpose of this article is to explore the drivers for art and design-based development in the urban environment through the lens of creative placemaking, and how this is practiced by creative class grassroots initiatives in cities such as Izmir, Turkey, which was shortlisted in the Creative City Network competition in 2019. The methodology is built on 1) a framework analysis through the research on art and design districts and the utilisation of creative placemaking, and 2) a field study exploring the creative placemaking drivers in an emerging art district, Darağaç, in Izmir. The field study is composed of site visits, visual mappings, the use of snowball sampling to reach the creative class, and structured interviews. The framework analysis findings suggest a set of creative placemaking drivers for art and design-based developments, and the case study findings present implications for future policies for integration of localised initiatives into the creative city framework. Framework Analysis The practice of creative cities applies one-size-fits-all strategies based on tangible and intangible characteristics to attract talent and support economic growth, whereas creative placemaking offers some crucial approaches to contribute to a locale's success and involvement in larger-scale plans. Therefore, placemaking appears as a phenomenological process that explains a sense of place, attachments, and, more broadly, the interaction between a region and its inhabitants (Mengi and Guaralda). The term ‘creative placemaking’ was first used by economist Ann Markusen and art consultant Anne Gadwa in the 2010 White Paper of the National Endowment for the Arts, as a solution when cities, suburbs, and small towns are faced with structural changes and displacement. Creative placemaking aims to revitalise space and economic development with creative initiatives. Markusen and Gadwa argue that creative placemaking provides gains in areas such as innovative products and services, livability, diversity, jobs, and income opportunities. Creative placemaking is also defined as a community-participatory tool to strengthen and enrich the identity of a place as well as development of a place. Community identity enables local assets to build trust and relationships (Kelkar et al.) while exploiting social and civic fabric that brings out the local character and narratives (Borrup). Moreover, Redaelli formulates creative placemaking as an innovative way of thinking for solving community problems that utilises the creative power of art and artists. From an economic perspective, Gallagher et al. point out that creative placemaking can happen in communities of any size and uses art and cross-sector collaboration to benefit the space. Creative placemaking through cross-sector collaboration is directly related to political ideology, social division, community size, resource limitations, and capacity of arts organisations. The theoretical discussion derived from the literature enables us to reconsider the use of creative placemaking approaches for creative city strategies and provides a framework that brings the most significant drivers of creative placemaking, especially for art and design-based strategies in urban environments (Table 1).

Creative Practices, as the first driver, aim to describe tangible outputs such as products, works of art, events, and festivals. Wyckoff defines projects and activities involving art, culture, and creative thinking as the driving forces of creative placemaking to create collective memory. In this regard, Mutero et al. emphasise the importance of listening and gathering stories, in which it associates definitions such as community, local knowledge, and context. Describing community participation as a tool to improve the development of a place, Kelkar et al. mention that it helps to change the perception of the community. In this context, it creates trust and relationships while building community identity and sense of belonging. Creative Placemakers, as the second driver, represent actors in creative placemaking. One of the six drivers suggested by Markusen and Gadwa for creating a successful place are the creative initiators. Borrup, on the other hand, underlines the role of crucial actors, named as creative placemakers, such as city planners, developers, artists, local policy makers. neighbourhood residents, and local audiences, who also take part in creative practices guided by artists, designers, and craftspeople. According to Gaumer et al. and Schupbach, local actors must be involved as partners to realise more effective successful creative placemaking practices. Similarly, Kelkar et al. argue that the relationships that are built on the collaborative nature of involving actors transform productivity and create social capital. Spatial Environment, as the third driver, focusses on the spaces of creative practices. Spatial environments can be referred to at different scales, such as the digital hubs, ateliers, maker spaces, and event areas such as art galleries and exhibition areas that bring creative placemakers together and enable them to produce together. According to Ellery et al., such spaces enhance the use of public spaces while providing a sense of aesthetics, security, and community. Wyckoff lists drivers of creative placemaking as art spaces where artistic, cultural, and creative projects take place, work and living spaces for the creative class, art, culture, and entertainment activities. Institutional Support, as the fourth driver, underlines the expectations of creative placemakers from institutions. The institutional support through networking provides a platform for creative placemakers to establish dialogue as well as opportunities for exhibition areas and performances. The importance of the support of institutions and organisations such as the public sector, private sector, NGOs, and sponsors are essential to creative placemaking practices. Particularly, cross-sector partnership between institutions such as education institutions, art institutions, art organisations, non-government organisations, and government plays an important role in art and design-based development (Markusen and Gadwa; Borrup). Emergence of Darağaç as an Art District Creative places are found at various scales, such as regions, districts, hubs, and studios, and constitute the very integral part of the creative city formation. They represent a high culture ground on which artists and designers can design, make, and exhibit art. The secret of the successful transformation of creative places lies in the spontaneity of their development. The spontaneously emerging creative places are found as the result of a bottom-up approach where the resident involvement in this transformation strengthens the bond between local people and the place. Spontaneous developments are visible where cultural producers come together to attract like-minded producers (Zukin &amp; Braslow). Examples of this phenomenon include New York City's SoHo neighbourhood, Beijing's 798 Arts District, Kreuzberg in Berlin, and the Temple Bar district in Dublin (Goldenberg-Miller et al.). The development of a spontaneous art and design district starts with the coming together of artists, designers, and cultural workers to form a network. Factors strengthening the network and contributing to the success of the region include community perception, information exchange within the community, and working and living together (Kumer). Darağaç has very recently emerged as an art district in Umurbey neighbourhood in Izmir. Known formerly as an industrial zone, it now hosts small industries and artists. Darağaç Art District, home to pre-Republican era factories operated by non-Muslim minorities and nineteenth-century two-storey workers' residences, was developed in the twentieth century as an industrial zone hosting Şark Sanayi Electric Factory, İzmir Cotton Fabric Factory, and Sümerbank Basma Industry (Kayın qtd. in Pasin et al.). A small group of artists from Izmir settled in the region in 2013, in rented former workers' residences serving as studios and residences, and shortly afterwards the district started to attract more artists and designers (Darağaç Collective). Surrounded by inert and functionless industrial buildings, Darağaç Art District still maintains its industrial identity as well as hosting those on low incomes and providing artists with opportunity to live and produce (Kocaer). There has been an increasing dialogue established between the original inhabitants, mostly craftspeople, and the artists, especially after 2 craftspeople and 13 artists opened their first exhibitions in June 2016 (Darağaç Collective). Since then, Darağaç has evolved to an “art district”, home to many projects and national and international artists. This has greatly shaped the physical environment and neighbourhood identity in the Darağaç Art District (fig. 1). Fig. 1: The integration of artworks or installations with the physical environment and neighbourhood identity in the Darağaç Art District. (Source: Kanal.) For Yavuzcezzar, the main purpose of Darağaç is to provide a space or a common discourse for young artists to exhibit their works. Darağaç Art District hosts interdisciplinary art works covering painting, photography, sculpture, installation, video, and performance (Yavuzcezzar). Also, Children's Meetings held in Darağaç Art District aim to increase the engagement of children in the neighbourhood through culture and arts (Darağaç Collective). Kılınç et al. explain the three main factors contributing to the development of the Darağaç Art District: site specificity; collaborative art practice; and close personal relationships established between neighbours. The site specificity factor is defined as the expansion of production towards the street and the inert lots in the district, replacing the existing spatial configurations in the neighbourhood, which do not meet the needs of the artists. Collaborative art practice is defined as the exchange between local people and artists. Kılınç et al. argue that the productive roles of artists and craftspeople have enabled them to establish a cooperation. The third factor is the close relationship established between neighbours through the Darağaç Collective Association in 2020 (Kılınç et al.). This has been visible in one of the most influential projects, ‘Darağaç Bostan’, in Darağaç (fig. 2). Fig. 2: Co-creation efforts in the Darağaç Art District. (Source: Culture Civic.) The case of Darağaç illustrates a unique case of a spontaneously emerged art district and underlines the importance of creative placemaking drivers for bottom-up creative city strategies. The area has been a democratic space via meetings, exhibitions, and workshops (fig. 3). Fig. 3: Knowledge-sharing practices in the Darağaç Art District. (Source: Darağaç.) The Case of Darağaç The case study consists of site visits, visual mappings, use of snowball sampling for reaching the artists and craftspeople, and structured interviews, and discusses the major drivers of creative placemaking and how they are practiced in Darağaç in Izmir. First Studies The first site visit to the Darağaç Art District was conducted in November 2020. At the time, there were a total of 13 artists and over 30 craftspeople located in the area (fig. 4). Following this, the pilot survey was conducted in February 2021, with a total of six participants, four artists, and two craftspeople from Darağaç Art District. All six participants were interviewed face-to-face, and each survey took approximately 15-20 minutes. After feedback from the pilot study participants, several changes were made in the final version of the survey. The following image illustrates the spatial clustering of craftspeople and artists residing in the neighbourhood who participated in the study (fig. 4). Fig. 4: Darağaç Survey Map. The Survey and Findings The four above-mentioned main drivers of creative placemaking, namely creative practices, creative placemakers, spatial environment, and institutional support, were addressed by Likert-scale questions. In the framework of the previously identified creative placemaking drivers, the survey was carried out to collect the opinions of the art district residents and draw conclusions. The participants were classified into three categories: artists, designers, and craftspeople. The first part of the survey is composed of general questions (age, gender, field of study, etc.) to give an overall idea of the participants. In the following four sections, it was aimed to measure the major drivers of creative placemaking, categorised as creative practices, creative placemakers, spatial environment, and institutional support. The fifth part examined the spatiality of art and design-based development in Darağaç in terms of economic, environmental, cultural, and social aspects. The survey was conducted between February and March 2021 in Darağaç Art District. All the art district residents were contacted and the rate of return of surveys was approximately 50%. 58% of the participants were resident in the neighbourhood, 42% were non-resident. 42% of participants reported that they used shared workspaces; 58% used individual workspaces. According to the survey results, the driving forces that most contribute to the development of the region are creative practices (art and craft works), creative placemakers (artists, designers, and craftspeople), and spatial environment (place identity), followed by institutional support from public, private, and non-governmental organisations, respectively (fig. 5). Fig. 5: Contributions of drivers to creative placemaking in Darağaç. It seems that the interaction and collaboration grouped under creative practice contribute significantly to the development of Darağaç, closely followed by knowledge and skill exchange and the presence of art and design events, and, lastly, by the final products. Considering the role of placemakers in the spontaneous development of Darağaç, an art district, the findings reveal that artists make the greatest contribution, followed by designers and craftspeople, while the impact of the residents as placemakers is relatively low. The results for the place-based inspirations for creative placemakers show that the spatiality of placemaking has a considerable effect on the texture of the neighbourhood. For the placemakers in the district, the pre-existence of artists, designers, and craftspeople in Darağaç was one of the main reasons for locating there. The neighbourhood’s cultural and historical value and the communication with the local community have equal importance in terms of their contribution to the spontaneous development. Finally, we examine institutional support as the final driver, which falls behind the other three, as seen in fig. 5. Only 38% of the participants reported that they were able to collaborate with an institution before, while only 38% managed to receive financial support. According to the results, the main three actors supporting the grassroots activities through collaborations are art organisations, universities, and municipalities. The results also show that the financial support through funding comes mainly from the existing associations and public authorities. Evaluation The results obtained from the case study show that cultural exchange has been the most influential factor in art and design-based development. Regarding the creative placemaking drivers, dialogue between the residents of the neighborhood has considerably increased as they share and exchange knowledge and skills since the art district development spontaneously started. Changing perceptions of the neighborhood residents through time and their growing relationship with art, design, and crafts have greatly contributed to the emergence of an art district. When we examine the art and design-based development, it is visible that the neighbourhood has evolved to a more attractive and atmospheric space for art and design practices. The results underline the role of solidarity and sense of belonging for strengthening the community engagement. We can also argue that the adaptive reuse of vacant spaces and the design of possible exhibition spaces have dramatically changed the identity of the space. However, the economic impacts of spontaneous art and design-based development have remained moderate with regard to the creation of auxiliary sectors to the production process, creating new jobs and income opportunities and having a self-sufficient economy. Conclusion Since 2010, the placemaking process has been more sensitive, with the help of increased human input and indication of co-creation tactics through creative placemaking. Creative placemaking has been reshaped along the creative city policies and strategies. Before the conceptualisation of creative placemaking, many authors (see Jones; Weitz; Wositzsky), had referred to the link between art and community development, and highlighted how artists, art societies and local communities are positively affected by using art as a tool for the community. Within this context, this article provides a relatively more comprehensive approach to art and design-based development within the framework of creative placemaking for the creative cities of today. It examines and categorises the creative placemaking components, and explores how these components work and how they contribute to spontaneous art district development through the case of Darağaç, Izmir, in Turkey, a place where artists, designers, and craftspeople live and produce together. Culture and creativity as significant tools for economic development and urban renewal are found in many of the recent planning strategies (Codignola). The creative economy, cultural tourism, and creative placemaking have encouraged communities to use art for economic benefit (Gallagher et al.). According to Grodach, art and design spaces can contribute to tourism by attracting visitors from the immediate environment while providing employment opportunities to local artists and thus contributing to individual well-being and local economic development. Although this does not have the power to eliminate problems such as displacement, unemployment, and social exclusion, it makes a great contribution to urban inequality (Grodach). The four main drivers, creative practices, creative placemakers, spatial environment, and institutional support, all play a significant role in the emergence of Darağaç as an art district. The most influential driver, that of creative practices, highlights the importance of art and design production and events and festivals as creative practices, indicating a high concentration of local assets and tacit knowledge. Secondly, placemakers have a considerable importance in the spontaneous transformation from an industrial zone to an art district with regard to craftspeople’s and designers’ living and work environments. Also, their collective attitude towards the local residents in the area seems to have significantly contributed to this development through skill exchange, community involvement, and co-creation. Thirdly, the spatial environment, originating in the 1930s, and the available amenities have a great influence on the identity formation of the district. Lastly, the available institutional support underlines the strong role of art and design in economic development. However, Darağaç Art District has yet to receive sufficient support from the institutions, and tries to sustain its organic structure by operating as a self-sufficient entity. In further studies, additional drivers must be examined on an individual basis to arrive at policy suggestions, due to the strategic importance of building a feeling of place in the attraction and retention of creative talent. For the policy recommendations, it is important that the current urban agenda should present a combination of characteristics derived from the framework of creative placemaking for building better and more habitable creative places, rather than focussing solely on the more visible economic and physical urban goals. It is crucial to understand the strategic balance of the various drivers that enable the growth of creative places for future urban development. For the practical implications, the use of creative placemaking drivers for spontaneous art and design-based development enables the collaboration between different actors and engagement of grassroots activities in policymaking.

rayyan-210781945,A Deep Learning-Based Framework for Urban Active Population Mapping from Remote Sensing Imagery,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"The active population is an indicator of urban vitality, representing socioeconomic vitality. An accurate mapping for the active population is the foundation for supporting regional sustainable development. Current research mainly relies on human mobile location data, which are challenging to access due to privacy and data sharing concerns. Thus, it is essential to map a wide area of the active population cost-effectively. This study demonstrates how an end-to-end deep learning approach can be used to reliably estimate urban active population distribution from remote sensing imagery. Learning based on the object and regional feature may provide insights into active population distribution by coupling ResNet-50 and Fully Convolutional Networks to achieve economic features that fuse Google surface features and night-light remote sensing data. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of using multiple remote sensing data to quantify the distribution of active populations. The proposed model <tex xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"">$(\text{ResNet}-50+\text{FCN},\ R^{2}=0.82)$</tex> can better explain the differences in active population estimation than the ResNet-50 model ( <tex xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"">$R^{2}=0.61$</tex> ).

rayyan-210781956,Insights into the abnormal increase of ozone during COVID-19 in a typical urban city of China,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract. The outbreak of COVID-19 promoted strict restrictions to human activities in China, which led to dramatic decrease in most air pollutant concentrations (e.g., PM2.5, PM10, NOx, SO2, and CO). However, abnormal increase of ozone (O3) concentrations was found during the lockdown period in most urban areas of China. In this study, we conducted a field measurement targeting ozone and its key precursors by utilizing a novel proton transfer reaction time-of-flight mass spectrometer (PTR-TOF-MS) in Changzhou, which is representative for the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) city cluster of China. We further applied the integrated methodology including machine learning, observation-based model (OBM), and sensitivity analysis to get insights into the reasons causing the abnormal increase of ozone. Major findings include: (1) By deweathered calculation, we found changes in precursor emissions contributed 5.1 ppbv to the observed O3 during the Full-lockdown period, while meteorological conditions only contributed 0.5 ppbv to the O3 changes. (2) By using an OBM model, we found that although significant reduction of O3 precursors was observed during Full-lockdown period, the photochemical formation of O3 was stronger than that during the Pre-lockdown period. (3) The NOx / VOCs ratio dropped dramatically from 1.84 during Pre-lockdown to 0.79 in Full-lockdown period, which switched O3 formation from VOCs-limited regime to the conjunction of NOx- and VOC-limited regime. Additionally, the decrease in NOx / VOCs ratio during Full-lockdown period was supposed to increase the MeanO3 by 2.4 ppbv. Results of this study investigate insights into the relationship between O3 and its precursors in urban area, demonstrating reasons causing the abnormal increase of O3 in most urban areas of China during the COVID-19 lock-down period. This study also underlines the necessity of controlling anthropogenic OVOCs, alkenes, and aromatics in the sustained campaign of reducing O3 pollution in China.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-2021-834,"",,
rayyan-210782000,"PREDICTING OF URBAN EXPANSION USING CONVOLUTIONAL LSTM NETWORK MODEL: THE CASE OF SEOUL METROPOLITAN AREA, KOREA",,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract. As urbanization progresses, many studies about the analysis and prediction of land-use change and urban sprawl have been conducted recently. As the sprawl phenomenon progresses rapidly, the urban expansion phenomenon became uncontrolled and it has affected negatively on the city's environment and transportation finally. So, it is essential to identify lands likely to be urbanized in the future because it aids in establishing land use plans and policies pre-acting the negative impact of spatially urban expansion the sprawl by determining factors affecting the urban sprawl. Previous studies based on statistical models are limited to identifying determining factors, so the prediction performance is low compared to deep learning. On the other hand, existing studies using machine learning and deep learning overlook selecting specific region-focused variables. Therefore, this study aims to analyze and predict changes in the Seoul Metropolitan Area's sprawl in Korea using the Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory Network (ConvLSTM) with factors at the city scale and neighboring factors at the local scale in the Seoul Metropolitan Area (SMA). ConvLSTM is a type of combination model: combining Recurrent Neural Network(RNN) and Convolutional Neural Network(CNN). This study showed that ConvLSTM with factors at the city and neighboring factors at the local scale predicted the urbanized land. The determinants contain population and roads ratio at the city scale, and neighboring urban lands, distance to the nearest subway stations, slope, and elevation at the local scale. The results reveal that predicted urban lands in 2020 increase over the entire region. In particular, the expected urban lands in 2020 increase by reducing farmlands in the southern part of the SMA. It is consistent with the trend of urbanized lands from 1980 to 2010. In addition, urbanization occurs in areas adjacent to Seoul due to the well-established urban infrastructure. The results of this study can be used as evidence to establish sustainable land use plans and regulations in the future.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/isprs-annals-x-4-w3-2022-113-2022,"",,
rayyan-210782004,"Planning for sustainable transportation through the integration of technology, public policy, and behavioral change: A data-driven approach",,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Author(s): Liu, Bo | Advisor(s): De Shazo, George M.; Rajagopal, Deepak | Abstract: Transportation contributes importantly to the economy and society, but at substantial environmental cost. While much progress has been made to increase the energy efficiency of transportation systems, their continued expansion is a major threat to global climate change and urban air quality. Additional mitigation strategies are needed to reduce the negative environmental and public health impacts of transportation. In this dissertation, I tackle the complexity of achieving sustainable transportation by addressing questions arise at various stages of technology development and deployment. The first essay assesses the life cycle environmental impacts of technology pathways that convert waste resources into alternative transportation fuels and identifies the most efficient pathways for all US counties with respect to both energy production and climate benefits. I find that utilizing these resources in the contiguous US can generate 3.1 to 3.8 exajoules (EJ) of renewable energy annually, which would be a net energy gain of 2.4 to 3.2 EJ, and would displace GHG emissions of 103 to 178 million metric tons of CO2 equivalent every year. The second essay uses machine learning techniques to identify the most powerful socioeconomic, demographic, and geospatial predictors for plug-in electric vehicle (PEV) adoption across California census tracts. I find that the market penetration of PEVs is generally higher in more affluent neighborhoods with many homeowners and highly-educated residents. The lack of pro-environment intention and behaviors as well as the proportions of low-income households and low-value and high-density housing units negatively associate with PEV adoption. I also find that the deployment of workplace charging may be more effective than the deployment of public DC fast charging. The third essay analyzes the energy and environmental impacts of transit bus electrification and identifies strategies for charging infrastructure deployment at public transit agencies in Los Angeles County. I find that the transition to battery electric buses would increase particulate matter emissions from brake and tire wear in the near term and immediately reduce NOx, CO, and GHG emissions. Smart charging would be a critical element in the planning of transit bus electrification, as it reduces costs associated with charging infrastructure and electric demand by lowering charger needs and shaving peak load. In concert, the three essays in this dissertation expand the current literature in multiple fields and the findings presented in each of the three essays have important implications for research and practices in the area of sustainable transportation at various geographical scales.","",,"",,
rayyan-210782008,Featured Collection Introduction: “Connecting Land and Water for Healthy Communities”,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"This featured collection is a part of growing public policy conversation, professional practice, and academic research focused on the need and strategies to integrate land use and water planning. The need arises from fragmentation in the ways that professionals think about and have been organized to deal with land and water in their workplaces and professional organizations. However, there is an increasing recognition that land and water planning must be done jointly because how we use land shapes our demand for water and greatly impacts water quality, while the way we use and manipulate water involves significant changes to land. Integrative land–water strategies are the focus of this featured collection. The collection's purpose is to contribute to fostering land and water connections across the physical, social, and ecological domains. Here we provide a brief background on the origins of this featured collection in a 2021 specialty conference organized and hosted by the American Water Resources Association (AWRA) and the Babbitt Center for Land and Water Policy (Babbitt Center), and done in collaboration with many other sponsors, supporters, and participating organizations. We cover other activities associated with the 2021 specialty conference and plans for continuing conversations at a 2023 follow-up conference. We also highlight some of the themes and insights from this featured collection. Finally, we invite continuing submissions on integrating land and water to the Journal of the American Water Resources Association (JAWRA), which is planning another featured collection on this important topic. This featured collection11 While the guest associate editors of this collection were involved in the conference and are co-authors of some of the publications included here, none of them handled their own submissions and standard blind peer review procedures were strictly followed. The papers also adhered to all other editorial and peer review requirements of the journal. emerged from the 2021 virtual summer specialty conference entitled “Connecting Land and Water for Healthy Communities” (AWRA and Babbitt Center 2021a). The conference was the result of a collaboration between Jim Holway of the Babbitt Center for Land and Water Policy (a center of the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy) and Sharon Megdal of the Water Resources Research Center at the University of Arizona and board member of AWRA. Jim and Sharon are long-time colleagues and friends as well as practitioners and scholars of land and water integration, especially as it pertains to the Colorado River Basin. They served as the conference committee co-chairs from the two partnering host organizations, AWRA and Babbitt Center, and involved leaders and representatives from other national organizations on the conference committee. Those organizations included the Alliance for Water Efficiency (AWE), American Planning Association (APA), American Water Works Association (AWWA), United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), United States Water Alliance, and Water Research Foundation (WRF). Even more organizations were involved on the host and program committees, including representatives from foundations, utilities, universities, private firms, and various state, tribal and federal agencies. Members of the conference, host and program committees comprised the larger conference planning committee (AWRA and Babbitt Center 2021b). The 2021 AWRA specialty conference built on several previous efforts. The APA hosted “Water and Planning Connect” in Kansas City from September 11 to 12, 2018, the first conference aimed at bringing together land use planning and water management professionals from the public and private sectors. The conference addressed the pressing issues at the intersection of land and water, including the effects of climate change, aging infrastructure, and water equity, and how to overcome fragmentation in responding to these large-scale challenges. “Water and Planning Connect” followed several years of activities within APA aimed at recognizing the importance of integrating water into land use planning. These activities included a 2016 update of the APA Policy Guide on Water (APA 2016), the 2017 formation of APA's Water and Planning Network (WPN) (APA 2017), and the 2017 publication of PAS WPN Report 588, “Planners and Water” (Cesanek et al. 2017). More recently, several experts directly involved in these efforts have authored additional publications on the potential impact comprehensive plans have to address land and water integration at a local level (Rouse and Piro 2021; Rugland 2021). APA is an organization largely consisting of land use planners, and its recognition of the importance of considering water in land use planning and corresponding practice-related activities has been a significant contribution. The reciprocal importance of considering the implications of land use planning for water management was brought to the fore in the 2021 “Connecting Land and Water for Healthy Communities” conference by Jim and Sharon along with the original inceptors, Chi Ho Sham of AWWA, William (Bill) Cesanek of APA, and Mary Ann Dickinson, past president of AWE. AWRA, an organization largely consisting of water resource professionals, reached out to land use planners in an effort to connect the professional realms of land and water just as APA did to its water constituents for “Water and Planning Connect” in 2018. The AWRA and Babbitt Center specialty conference was held virtually from July 19 to 21, 2021 and featured keynote speakers Tanya Trujillo, United States Department of the Interior Assistant Secretary for Water and Science, and Aziza Akhmouch, Head of the Urban Policies and Sustainable Development Division within the Centre for Entrepreneurship, SMEs, Regions and Cities of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). The conference also included a pre- and post-conference workshop, two panels, 24 technical sessions, crowdsourcing land and water dialogues, and networking opportunities (AWRA and Babbitt Center 2021c). The mix of activities was designed to bring together practitioners and researchers across the intersecting areas of water management, land use planning, natural resources policy, and related technical and design professions. The conference focused on fostering relationships among water resources management, utility operations, and land use planning and design to strengthen connections across disciplines, professions, and organizations. Topics included land and water aspects of water supply, water demand management, stormwater management, wastewater treatment, community planning and design, conservation, and integrated “one water” approaches. The key theme running throughout the conference was the recognition that connecting land and water is necessary for healthy and resilient communities and that new tools and evidence-based strategies are needed to foster and evaluate experiences with making those connections. This featured collection is just one of the several activities associated with the 2021 “Connecting Land and Water for Healthy Communities” conference. Here we highlight three of them. Preceding the July 2021 conference, AWRA published a special issue of Water Resources IMPACT (March/April 2021, Volume 23, Number 2) on “Connecting Land and Water for Healthy Communities” (AWRA 2021a). The issue was guest edited by Mike Antos, who wrote in “About this Issue” (p. 1): “Arguably, managing water separately from land was one of the great missteps of the 20th century. Turning our eyes to past practices, and recognizing the role watersheds play in the health of the environment and our communities, we see that land and water must be managed together as integrated social-natural systems … I am proud as guest editor to share these stories and examples of how land use managers and water managers are rediscovering the power of partnering for the benefit of people and the environment.” This special issue of Water Resources IMPACT included eight articles introducing important perspectives and work related to the conference theme. Case studies from all over the country focused on integrative land–water solutions, bringing attention to vulnerable communities in flood-prone areas and areas impacted by drought, and specific ways in which strategies for greater integration is key to addressing this vulnerability. This special issue of Water Resource IMPACT was a valuable introduction to topics and actions taking place on the ground in communities that were incorporated into the 2021 specialty conference. One major outcome of the 2021 Conference was the “Findings Statement and Call to Action from the Specialty Conference: Connecting Land & Water for Healthy Communities” which was approved by AWRA with the Babbitt Center for Land and Water Policy, the APA Water and Planning Network, and the AWWA. After the conference, members of the planning committee came together and agreed on the importance of actualizing integrative land and water solutions. Together, they drafted a “Findings Statement” of key conclusions they drew from the diversity of presentations and conversations throughout the conference. These findings acknowledge the major ways fragmentation occurs and how it results in unsustainable patterns of growth and resource utilization that increase vulnerabilities of communities to water and land-related risks. Realizing that a findings statement was not enough, they included a “Call to Action” to encourage their organizations, other conference participants, and the land and water professional community at large to implement the set of guiding principles included in the findings statement. This “Findings Statement and Call to Action” was approved as an official AWRA Policy Statement (AWRA 2021b) and is also reprinted here in this featured collection (AWRA et al. 2021). We are pleased that the productive conversations will continue, and the land and water community will have opportunities to discuss how it is implementing the Call to Action by bringing forth more examples and lessons. In July of 2023, AWRA will be hosting the second specialty conference on the general theme of “Connecting Land and Water for Healthy Communities,” scheduled for July 17 to 19, 2023 in Denver, Colorado (AWRA 2022). Our hope is that this collection of activities, research, and partnerships and yet another opportunity to meet, this time in person in Denver, Colorado, will indeed inspire additional collaborations, new ideas and inquiries, and creative and bold actions that continue leading to implementation of integrative land–water solutions. The 2021 “Connecting Land & Water for Healthy Communities” specialty conference suggests that to ensure healthy and resilient communities, connecting planning and management of land and water is necessary. Moreover, the “Findings Statement and Call to Action” from this conference urges connections between multiple stakeholders and stakeholder groups and utilization of science, tools, practices, and technologies that integrate land and water planning and use. The integration of land and water planning is the foundational thread of the articles in this featured collection. However, the articles also showcase the ways in which integrative land–water solutions can be focused or more expansive in response to diverse stakeholders and varying circumstances and depending on how and where integration can be applied and adapted. Cross-cutting themes emerged in each of these pieces, including issues of scale, context, complexity; the need for new research, new ways of knowing, new tools; working in interdisciplinary teams and spanning boundaries across professions and organizations; the need for local as well as regional land–water coordination; and the use of an institutional lens in recognition of ways society can work more collectively toward larger scale societal sustainability. Stoker et al. (2022) begin this collection with a review of regulatory and non-regulatory strategies for integrated land–water solutions. The authors synthesize existing literature and emphasize the need for new research to establish the evidentiary basis to support the implementation of these strategies, prioritize one strategy over another, and determine the contexts in which various strategies are likely to be most effective. The scales inherent in both regulatory and non-regulatory strategies are apparent in each of the manuscripts included in this featured collection. Turner et al. (2022) also describe differences in scale between local ordinances, which can better integrate water and land use, vs. federal level regulations like the Clean Water Act that focus only on water quality. Sampson et al. (2022) look at city policies and water demand by examining a range of neighborhood housing typologies (essentially different scales of housing density) and conducting scenario planning analyses across the Denver Water service area. Wang and Vivoni (2022) employ regional scenario modeling to investigate the implications of climate and land use and land cover for future irrigation water demand in different cities, irrigation districts, and counties in central Arizona as well as at the regional scale. Endter-Wada et al. (2022) illustrate the scales of governance and institutional influence including examples of policies, processes, and projects at federal, state, local, and utility scales. They focus on cooperation and partnership between and within these scales to mobilize sustainability transitions. Jacobs et al. (2022) focus on the need to integrate planning across scales since different environmental issues occur and are dealt with through institutions with authority and influence in varying geographies (e.g., state, watershed, irrigation district, municipal, and individual property). Highlighting the importance of scale, the manuscripts in this featured collection show that context is an important aspect of integrated land–water management. Turner et al. (2022) note that stormwater professionals stated that multiple factors were part of their stormwater infrastructure decision making, including watershed-scale issues and other added complexities like climate change and social norms (complexities also suggested by Jacobs et al. 2022). They also find regional differences in stormwater professionals' decision making related to water quality (eastern states) vs. water quantity (western states) and potentials for green infrastructure solutions to more effectively help them link land and water. Although Sampson et al. (2022) found that incremental increases in residential density is one way to improve urban water efficiency, policies that reduce outdoor irrigation may have more success at reducing outdoor water demand than policies purely focused on increasing residential densities. They conclude that variations that relate to building type and specific density configurations are important contextual complexities to consider in understanding and managing urban water demand and outdoor water efficiency. Wang and Vivoni (2022) suggest that local contextual differences such as future land use change trajectories combined with climate change predictions are very important elements to consider in irrigation water use projections. Endter-Wada et al. (2022) show how integrating land and water can occur in numerous ways and result in distinctive forms. In their four examples, the integration occurs through analysis, by design, from conceptual borrowing, and via facilitation and, despite general application to many communities, it is context that determines specific outcomes, adopted practices, and instituted policies. Jacobs et al. (2022) highlight that environmental challenges are highly context dependent, including being influenced by social norms, population/demographic changes, and physical and climatic differences. Jacobs et al.’s (2022) call to look at “the intersection of the climate-land use-energy-water systems collectively” (p. 2) is an important consideration in this featured collection looking at integrated water–land planning. The authors remind us that even looking at two issues in an integrated way ignores the true complexity of the issues at hand. Sampson et al. (2022) and Wang and Vivoni's (2022) manuscripts provide focused examinations of water and land use interactions, which are important pieces of the puzzle in terms of water conservation and use. Yet, each manuscript also provides important insights through recognition and analysis of additional components that add complexity. Sampson et al. (2022) simulate the effects of human activity (building types where households choose to live) and other behavioral and technological changes (gains in irrigation efficiency) in addition to increasing housing density on future water demand. Wang and Vivoni's (2022) inclusion of climate change effects as well as differing modes of future land change related to urban growth shows how differences in irrigation water use can become even more pronounced in the future. Their works and insights could be built upon to include even more complexity (e.g., equity in housing; interactions between housing, water and transportation; implications of agricultural land loss on food, fuel, and fiber). Endter-Wada et al.’s (2022) examples speak to the institutional changes needed to move resilient solutions forward. Although the authors looked specifically at integrated land–water solutions, Endter-Wada et al. (2022) show the importance of partnerships and stakeholder engagement to foster institutional transformation that could translate to increasingly complex issues. Recognition of the importance of complexities at the intersection of climate, land use, energy, and water systems (CLEWs) is critical for stretching our analysis and understanding of problems and challenging and enabling us to find appropriate solutions. But it does not negate the need to work at the intersection of land and water. The reason linking land and water remains important is because human interaction with the environment occurs through the processes of using land and water and, increasingly, through processes of large-scale land use change and water manipulation, all of which are driven by social processes. Land changes to the surface of the earth affect the water cycle, especially large-scale urbanization in arid regions and development in flood-prone riparian and coastal areas in humid regions. Similarly, changes to natural water sources and flows affect the land, most dramatically illustrated when water diversions result in desiccated lakes, dry streams, and loss of wetlands, or when water is diverted from basins of origin, often to the detriment of human and ecological communities located on tribal and rural lands. Human changes to land or water without regard to impacts resulting from their linkage are dramatically changing the earth's surface. These changes are resulting in cascading effects on socio-ecological systems and on larger physical and climatic earth system processes. Changes occurring at the interface of land and water policy, planning, and management remain foundational because numerous government agencies have well-established regulatory and management authority over land and/or water as well as deeply rooted professional and institutional cultures where changes are key to societal sustainability transitions. Finally, the authors of the manuscripts and the associate editors of this featured collection suggest the following topics to consider exploring and using in future research and practice. We should strive to create comprehensive open-source data and use exploratory processes and data-driven tools to examine complex issues so that we can learn from each other and provide better decision support, the value of which is illustrated in the articles by Sampson et al. (2022) and Wang and Vivoni (2022). The need to determine metrics to examine water outcome goals and to use these metrics to understand success over time across case studies and contexts was emphasized by Stoker et al. (2022) and suggested in various ways throughout this collection. Developing paths forward to allow for adaptive management in planning, policy, and rulemaking and for institutional transformations rely not only on good analytic and evaluative techniques, but on the ability to build and use interdisciplinary teams, partnerships, and champions of new ideas to work on complex issues, as reinforced in the articles by Turner et al. (2022) and Endter-Wada et al. (2022). Issues at the intersections of climate–land use–energy–water systems are critical, as the questions raised in table 1 by Jacobs et al. (2022) indicate, which highlights why creating frameworks for coordination and integration across scales is so important. As the “Findings Statement and Call to Action” reminds us, integrating equity, health, and safety should be at the heart of every inquiry and practice, and our professions need to commit to guiding principles that help us keep this focus at the forefront of our work. The focus on “Connecting Land and Water for Healthy Communities” in the March/April issue of Water Resource IMPACT, the 2021 specialty conference and resulting “Findings Statement and Call to Action,” and this featured collection of JAWRA all contribute to recognizing land–water disconnections and finding integrated solutions for overcoming them. Much work needs to be done to understand the many dimensions, meanings, and implications of integrating land and water, to promote practices and technologies for facilitating integration, and to evaluate, test, and document the short- and long-term outcomes from integration (Quay et al. 2022). We look forward to land use and water management professionals' joint contributions to this work and to expanding our collective learning and conversations at the second AWRA summer specialty conference on this topic from July 17 to 19, 2023 in Denver, Colorado. Data sharing is not applicable to this article as no new data were created or analyzed in this study.","",https://doi.org/10.1111/1752-1688.13042,"",,
rayyan-210782013,The Impact of Mature National High-Tech Zone Development on Sustainable Smart City Development in China,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"In recent years, the rapid economic development of China's regions has led to a significant increase in urbanization, but this has been accompanied by significant resource consumption and pollutant emissions. So it is crucial to enhance sustainable development while achieving efficient urban development. Also National High-Tech Industrial Development Zones (NHTIDZs) have enhanced regional industrial agglomeration and technological innovation. This paper measured the Sustainable Smart Development level of cities and the development level of NHTIDZs. And using linear regression confirmed that high-tech zone development is closely related to urban development. Then used an Artificial Neural Network model to investigate the deeper correlation between the two. The results demonstrated that. (1) Although National High-tech Zone Index (NHTZI) had a significant effect on Sustainable smart cities index (SSCI), the effect was less than its grading index. (2) The ANN analysis shows that the Scale of the NHTIDZs has the greatest impact on the SSCI and also on the four SSCI classification indicators.","",https://doi.org/10.54691/bcpbm.v24i.1443,"",,

Prospects for the use of artificial intelligence in managing all areas of the city: economic, transport, administrative, social, etc. open the way to the development of smart cities. Smart cities combine a wide variety of technologies and support those innovations that are capable of ensuring sustainable social and economic development of cities. The implementing of sensors for collecting and analyzing data of various areas of the city functioning provides material for statistical analysis that is not subject to human intelligence, but artificial. This information will be useful for the administrative structures to analyze their work done in city management, to track the dynamics of changes in the city, to obtain up-to-date data for researchers. This information is equally important for the urbanists for accurate and rapid calculations, which typically take up a significant portion of design time. The potential for using AI is fully revealed when using accurate statistics and relevant data, AI will be capable of designing urban structures taking into account all the rules, norms and factors. Using of artificial intelligence is not limited to statistics: predicting the outcome of design based on the changes made will help to find mistakes at the design stage by simulating the processes that take place in the city. The potential of using artificial intelligence is being fully exploited when, using accurate statistics and up-to-date data, AI will be able to design urban structures, taking into account all the rules, regulations and factors. With a broader selection of project options, architects and urban planners will be able to choose the one that will meet the needs of all design participants the best.","",https://doi.org/10.31650/2707-403x-2020-14-48-59,"",,
rayyan-210782030,Cognitive Cities: The Synthesis of Artificial Intelligence and The Urban Environment,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Digital transformation and the advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI) are rapidly disrupting many facets of human life through emerging technologies, such as in computer vision, natural language processing, speech recognition, augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR), robotics and autonomous systems. COVID-19, while disrupting entire economies, has also propelled innovation in digital services for employment (remote working), health care (clinical networks), public transportation (self-driving cars), logistics (autonomous systems), and leisure (entertainment platforms) around the world, building upon technological megatrends of the last decades. However, despite this rapid progress, these technological advances have been randomly applied to the improvement of city living and of the human-digital user experience in urban spaces. To respond to this unprecedented advancement of technology and its future integration into the design and management of cities, the cognitive city promises to connect citizens to services more efficiently, increasing the cognition and “learning” of the city itself. Smart cities are fitted with sensors to collect information from citizens and infrastructure that improves efficiency and cost of resources. A cognitive city, however, is more resilient, efficient, and sustainable, able to sense, understand, and respond to challenges in its environment, and to learn and adapt its behaviours, operations, and services based on analysis and contextualization of past experiences.","",https://doi.org/10.55412/05.04,"",,

Growing accessibility to big data and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies have revolutionised many fields and offered great potential for addressing pressing urban problems. However, using these technologies without explicitly considering responsibilities would bring new societal and environmental issues. To maximise the benefits of big data and AI while minimising potential issues, we envisage a conceptual framework of Responsible Urban Intelligence (RUI) and advocate an agenda for action. We first define RUI as consisting of three major components including urban problems, enabling technologies, and responsibilities; then introduce transparency, fairness, and eco-friendliness as the three dimensions of responsibilities which naturally link with the human, space, and time dimensions of cities; and further develop a four-stage implementation framework for responsibilities as consisting of solution design, data preparation, model building, and practical application; and finally present a research agenda for RUI addressing challenging issues including data and model transparency, tension between performance and fairness, and solving urban problems in an eco-friendly manner.","",https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2208.04727,"",,
rayyan-210782042,Urbanization and sustainable urban development in China,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"In China, all of the problems of competitiveness and sustainability are exacerbated by demography. Between 1982 and 2010 China's urban population tripled, with the largest increase being due to temporary migrants from rural areas. These migrants have no permanent status and lack access to basic services such as housing, sanitation, water, schools and health care. They lack skills and are used in the most menial types of work; they are one of the principal problems for urban areas. The situation is magnified by the application of advanced technology such as AI, robots and internet communication. To resolve this problem, Shen argues for a regional approach to planning that will combine improvement of the economic life in smaller cities and towns along with planning for sustainable urbanization. The Hong Konk community of Ma On Shan offers a guide to this approach to the future of China's urban areas.","",https://doi.org/10.4337/9781839107481.00009,"",,
rayyan-210782043,Spatiotemporal characterization of urban activity and environment with imagery and deep learning,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: There are limited data on human activity and the environment needed to inform policies and target infrastructures to improve the health and wellbeing of residents in cities in sub-Saharan Africa, the world's fastest urbanising region. METHODS: We collected a bespoke dataset of 2.10 million images in Accra, Ghana, captured at five-minute internals over ~15 months at 145 representative locations. We retrained a convolutional neural network using a manually labelled subset of images to identify people (including street vendors) and 18 objects – categorised into large vehicles, small vehicles, two wheelers, objects from the market, refuse and animals – that collectively represent important features of human activity and the environment in the city. RESULTS:We identified 23.5 million of these objects in our dataset. Of these, 9.66 million (41%) were humans, followed by cars (4.19 million; 18%). We found strong correlation among the number of people, large vehicles and market-related objects, which were typically captured in the business and commercial core and high-density residential areas; moderate correlation between these three categories and small vehicles; weak correlation with two wheelers; and inverse correlation with refuse and animals which were more common in the peripheral areas of the city. The frequency of objects changed throughout the day with the extent of variation dependent on the type of object and location. There were noticeable reductions in the number of people, vehicles and market related activity in commercial and business areas during the Covid-19 lockdown, but smaller reductions observed in high-density residential areas. CONCLUSIONS:Contextual adaptation of computer vision tools can reduce the global gap in data on cities to advance sustainable and healthy urban development.

The effect of growing population and the challenges regarding urbanization and environmental sustainability have led the European Union to adopt different policies and initiatives to promote this new city model. Nevertheless, such processes use and produce massive amounts of data, which could affect people's privacy. Countries like Spain have begun to invest in smart cities and Artificial Intelligence projects to improve efficiency in the public sector. However, the use of artificial intelligence can generate several problems such as opacity, legal uncertainty, or breaches of personal data protection.

Lagos, Nigeria - Africa’s second most populous megacity- is a prime example. To achieve more sustainable and resilient cities, there is a need for modeling the urban growth patterns of major cities and analyzing their implications.  In this study, the urban growth of Lagos state was modeled using the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network for the transition modeling and the Markov Chain analysis for the change prediction, achieving a model accuracy of 81.8%. An innovative visual validation of the model results using the ArcGIS was combined with kappa correlation statistics. The results show that by 2031, built-up areas will be the most spatially extensive LULC class in the study area with percentage coverage of 34.1% as opposed to 9% in 1986. The coverage of bare areas is also expected to increase by 53% between 2016 and 2031. Conversely, 24.9% and 68.3% loss of forestlands and wetlands respectively, are expected between 2016 and 2031. In view of the 11 th goal of SDGs which focuses on achieving sustainable cities and communities, the objectives of African Union’s Agenda 2063, and based on the urban growth trends observed, the study recommends a prioritization of vertical expansion as opposed to the current horizontal urban growth trends in the study area.","",,"",,

This motivation for a better urban space led to the evolution of sustainable urban development, urban liveability, environmental awareness, inclusivity, and urban governance. Therefore, this research aimed to establish the intricate links between sustainable urban development, urban liveability, and inclusive physical development in selected cities in North-Central Nigeria. The theories examined were Citizen Participation, Dependency, Modernisation, and Infrastructure. The selected cities were Lokoja, Lafia, and Minna, all incidentally equidistant to Abuja, the Federal Capital City of Nigeria. This research employed a mixed-methods approach by collecting both qualitative and quantitative data. These data sets ranged from satellite imageries used for the spatio-temporal analysis and urban growth simulation through ArcGIS, Q-GIS, and the Artificial Neural Network. The extent of infrastructure provision and their methods were appraised using the instrumentality of the nearest neighbour analysis and the partial least square analysis using the SmartPLS. The research also appraised the stakeholders’ perceptions and methods of infrastructure provision through a word cloud analysis using NVivo analytics. In analysing the provision and condition of the infrastructure in North-Central Nigeria, educational infrastructure was found to be inadequate and poorly maintained; inadequate budgetary allocations exacerbated the problem of urban infrastructure overuse; illegal developments often overtook sites reserved for infrastructure; and funding, vandalism, and project continuity were cited as critical factors. The infrastructure that suffered the highest maintenance neglect was the urban water supply, education infrastructure, and the health care facilities. Political motivation and the population played the most significant roles in the region's urban infrastructure or project development. The triad of consumption, access, and equity was used to evaluate Hangwurian City Development's (HCD) proposed sustainable urban infrastructure development plan. Convergent validity was strong in the region, where the AVE was significant at 0.56 or more. A compact development model was found to be a valuable indicator for qualifying the cities. It was found that the challenge of planning regulation and siting of infrastructure could be addressed effectively, however, the public and private sector promoters of projects had to stick to their parts of the bargain. Cities across North-Central Nigeria had to undertake citizen-focused infrastructure planning and development. Therefore, the researcher concluded that city development and urban growth could be moderated through the instrumentality of adequate infrastructure provision and planning to prioritise the needs and desires of residents. This is achievable by adopting the Hangwurian City Development Model, which helps to promote cities without ills.","",https://doi.org/10.29086/10413/22763,"",,

Urban trees also play a key role in climate change mitigation and global warming by capturing and storing atmospheric carbon-dioxide which is the largest contributor to greenhouse gases. Automated tree detection and species classification using aerial imagery can be a powerful tool for sustainable forest and urban tree management. Hence, This study first offers a pipeline for generating labelled dataset of urban trees using Google Map's aerial images and then investigates how state of the art deep Convolutional Neural Network models such as VGG and ResNet handle the classification problem of urban tree aerial images under different parameters. Experimental results show our best model achieves an average accuracy of 60% over 6 tree species.","",,"",,

Timely data are needed to ensure that urban change enhance health, wellbeing and sustainability. METHODS: We characterise, as mutually exclusive clusters, the complex, multidimensional, built and natural environments in cities with high-resolution satellite images and unsupervised deep clustering. We apply our approach to Accra, Ghana, one of the fastest growing cities in the developing world, and contextualise the resultant clusters with demographic and environmental data that were not used for clustering. RESULTS: We show that image-based clusters captured distinct features of the urban built environment (building count, size, density, and orientation; length and arrangement of roads), vegetation, water, and population, either as a unique defining characteristic (e.g., bodies of water or dense vegetation) or in combination (e.g., buildings surrounded by vegetation or sparsely populated areas intermixed with roads). Clusters that were based on single defining characteristics were robust to the spatial scale of analysis and choice of cluster number, whereas those based on a combination of defining characteristics changed based on scale and number of clusters. CONCLUSION: The results demonstrate that satellite data and unsupervised deep learning provide a cost-effective interpretable and scalable approach for real-time tracking of sustainable urban development, especially where traditional environmental and demographic data are limited and not frequently updated. Our approach has multiple urban environmental applications, such as providing ground data for tracking and measuring urban health, air- and noise pollution, urban connectivity and road traffic, as well as city growth in cities across Africa and beyond.

rayyan-210782087,City as a Sensor for Platform Urbanism,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"The data-driven approach to sustainable urban development is becoming increasingly popular among cities across the world. This is due to cities' attention in supporting smart and sustainable urbanism practices. In an era of digitalisation of urban services and processes, that is upon us, platform urbanism is becoming a fundamental tool to support smart urban governance, and helping in the formation of a new version of cities—i.e., City 4.0. This new version utilises urban dashboards and platforms in its operations and management tasks of its complex urban metabolism. These intelligent systems help in maintaining the robustness of our cities, integrating various sensors (e.g., internet-of-things) and big data analysis technologies (e.g., artificial intelligence) with the aim of optimising urban infrastructures and services (e.g., water, waste, energy), and turning the urban system into a smart one. The chapter generates insights from the sensor city best practices by placing some of the renowned projects, implemented by Huawei, Cisco, Google, Ericsson, Microsoft, and Alibaba, under the microscope. The investigation findings disclosed that the sensor city approach: (a) Has the potential to increase the smartness and sustainability level of cities; (b) Manages to engage citizens and companies in the process of planning, monitoring, and analysing urban processes; (c) Raises awareness on the local environmental, social, and economic issues; and (d) Provides a novel city blueprint for urban administrators, managers, and planners. Nonetheless, the use of advanced technologies—e.g., real-time monitoring stations, cloud computing, surveillance cameras—poses a multitude of challenges related to: Quality of the data used; Level of protection of traditional and cybernetic urban security; Necessary integration between the various urban infrastructure; and Ability to transform feedback from stakeholders into innovative urban policies.","",https://doi.org/10.1201/9781003278986-15,"",,

Sustainability could include urban water management to alleviate possible conflict among &amp;amp;#8220;water&amp;amp;#8208;saving&amp;amp;#8221; and &amp;amp;#8220;greening cities&amp;amp;#8221; strategies. Water consumption by urban greenery has a major role in urban water management, particularly in water-scarce regions where green covers are most affected by drought and aridity. More green and blue water resources are required to maintain and expand urban green spaces. Quantifying the water footprint of urban greenery helps to balance greening cities while water saving from both green and blue water resources. We employed remote sensing and artificial intelligence techniques to assess the water consumption and water footprint of a 780&amp;amp;#8208;ha public green space, the Adelaide Parklands in Australia. We estimated the green and blue water footprint of this green space (containing 29 parks) during 2010-2018 on a monthly basis. Our results showed that the mean total water footprint of the Adelaide Parklands was about 7.75 gigaliter per annum over 2010-2018; it varied from 7.19 gigaliter/year in 2018 to 8.45 gigaliter/year in 2012. The blue water footprint was consistently higher than the green water footprint even in wet time of the year. We suggest implementing sponge city and water sensitive urban design (WSUD) techniques to help greening cities while reducing the water footprint of urban green spaces. These approaches have the potential to lessen the pressure on blue water resources and optimise the consumption of green water resources.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu21-100,"",,

However, research on sustainable urban roofscapes is rather focused on their potential and it is hindered by the scarcity of data, limiting our understanding of their current content, spatial distribution, and temporal evolution. To tackle this issue, we introduce Roofpedia, a set of three contributions: (i) automatic mapping of relevant urban roof typology from satellite imagery; (ii) an open roof registry mapping the spatial distribution and area of solar and green roofs of more than one million buildings across 17 cities; and (iii) the Roofpedia Index, a derivative of the registry, to benchmark the cities by the extent of sustainable roofscape in term of solar and green roof penetration. This project, partly inspired by its street greenery counterpart `Treepedia', is made possible by a multi-step pipeline that combines deep learning and geospatial techniques, demonstrating the feasibility of an automated methodology that generalises successfully across cities with an accuracy of detecting sustainable roofs of up to 100% in some cities. We offer our results as an interactive map and open dataset so that our work could aid researchers, local governments, and the public to uncover the pattern of sustainable rooftops across cities, track and monitor the current use of rooftops, complement studies on their potential, evaluate the effectiveness of existing incentives, verify the use of subsidies and fulfilment of climate pledges, estimate carbon offset capacities of cities, and ultimately support better policies and strategies to increase the adoption of instruments contributing to the sustainable development of cities.","",,"",,

The aim of this study is the development and implementation of a composite climate - air quality classification in order to describe and study their combined effects on living conditions and quality of life in urban environments. By employing pollutant observations from surface stations and climatic gridded data from reanalysis databases, the available data will be converted into groups of cases through a process which is based on a non-linear method of clustering and categorization. An artificial neural network methodology and in particular, self-organizing maps will be used to convert non-linear statistical associations of input data into simple geometric relationships of points in a low dimensional map. This method can create classifications of air pollutants and climatic parameters that group days which follow specific patterns, hidden due to non-linear interactions.

Sfide e minacce per le città del ventunesimo secolo,,1,1,,,,,,,,it,,,"[Italiano]:Le numerose e complesse sfide economiche, sociali e ambientali che dovranno essere affrontare nei prossimi decenni nell’ambito del governo delle trasformazioni urbane e territoriali richiederanno l’impiego di nuovi approcci in grado di orientare lo sviluppo dei contesti territoriali verso una sostenibilita sociale, economica e ambientale. Le scelte e gli interventi di trasformazione dovranno garantire un’adeguata qualita della vita ai cittadini e favorevoli condizioni per lo sviluppo delle attivita economiche e sociali. Tra le sfide che le citta dovranno affrontare nei prossimi anni vi e quella della crescita della popolazione urbana. Le proiezioni demografiche prevedono che nei prossimi decenni vi sara un ulteriore incremento della popolazione mondiale che interessera principalmente le aree urbane. Queste previsioni sottolineano ancor di piu la necessita d’intervenire in maniera prioritaria nelle citta al fine di ridurre gli effetti delle possibili minacce che possono verificarsi a seguito di eventi critici improvvisi di natura antropica e naturale. Negli ultimi anni, i governi nazionali e locali hanno programmato d’investire ingenti risorse economiche per lo sviluppo e la realizzazione d’interventi in grado di affrontare alle possibili criticita dei sistemi urbani. Nell’ambito del governo delle trasformazioni urbane uno degli approcci piu utilizzati per migliorare la capacita di risposta dei sistemi urbani al verificarsi di sollecitazioni esterne fa riferimento al paradigma della resilienza intesa come la capacita di un sistema, di una comunita o di una societa esposta a pericoli di resistere, assorbire, adattarsi e riprendersi dagli impatti di un evento calamitoso in modo tempestivo ed efficiente, anche attraverso la conservazione e il ripristino delle sue strutture e funzioni di base essenziali. L’implementazione di soluzioni orientate al miglioramento della resilienza urbana risulta ormai essenziale per ridurre i possibili impatti economici, sociali ed ambientali dovuti ad eventi critici che possono interessare le citta. Inoltre, l’impiego di questo approccio puo offrire una maggiore sicurezza ai cittadini e alle attivita economiche, sia in condizioni ordinarie che in condizioni d’emergenza. Il soddisfacimento di questa esigenza e ormai diventato un elemento fondamentale nella competizione tra i diversi contesti territoriali ed in particolare tra le citta. Gli studi piu recenti sulla competitivita urbana evidenziano come il tema dello sviluppo della resilienza urbana e diventato un aspetto imprescindibile nel valutare le capacita competitive dei diversi contesti territoriali. La messa a punto e l’implementazione d’interventi orientati a rendere le citta resilienti non possono prescindere dall’impiego di soluzioni, fisiche e funzionali, di tipo smart che ormai costituiscono un supporto essenziale nel migliorare la capacita di risposta che le citta e le sue componenti sono in grado di offrire al verificarsi di sollecitazioni interne ed esterne. Rendere una citta resiliente richiede la realizzazione d’interventi, infrastrutturali e organizzativi, complessi che devono considerare la molteplicita e la dinamicita delle componenti urbane coinvolte e che quindi non possono prescindere dall’impiego delle piu recenti tecnologie, hardware e software. Intervenire sulla resilienza urbana puo consentire alle citta di conseguire anche un migliore livello di smartness. ln questo ampio dibattito scientifico si inseriscono gli approfondimenti e le considerazioni raccolte in questo volume. In particolare, la finalita di questo lavoro e approfondire le tematiche connesse alle sfide che le citta dovranno affrontare nei prossimi decenni per garantire un’adeguata qualita della vita ai cittadini, evidenziando come l’impiego di un approccio resiliente puo migliorare la risposta che questi contesti territoriali al verificarsi di situazioni di criticita. Vengono studiati nel dettaglio i temi della competitivita territoriale e della smartness urbana all’interno di un nuovo modo di pensare scientifico, tecnico e culturale che fa della resilienza il paradigma di riferimento primario. Cio al fine di comprendere quanto lo sviluppo resiliente e in grado di supportare sia il miglioramento della capacita di una citta di competere con altri contesti territoriali, sia di favorire il conseguimento di un adeguato livello di smartness urbana. L’obiettivo e quello di mettere a punto un quadro di riferimento scientifico, dettagliato e aggiornato, sulle principali esigenze e criticita che le citta sono chiamate a fronteggiare e sulla necessita di promuovere l’utilizzo di un approccio orientato al miglioramento della resilienza urbana, nell’ottica di affrontare le sollecitazioni e i cambiamenti esterni ed interni che interessano questi contesti territoriali. In altre parole, si mettono in luce le relazioni che si possono instaurare tra lo sviluppo della citta resiliente sia con la capacita di un sistema urbano di competere con altri contesti territoriali che con le potenzialita offerte dall’impego di soluzioni smart, fisiche e funzionali, in ambito urbano.
 ./[English]:The numerous and complex economic, social and environmental challenges that will have to be faced in the coming decades in the context of the governance of urban and territorial transformations will require the use of new approaches, capable of orienting development in a socially, economically and environmentally sustainable way. The choices and initiatives for change must guarantee an adequate quality of life for citizens and favourable conditions for the development of economic and social activities. Among the challenges that cities will have to face in the coming years is that of urban population growth. Demographic projections foresee that in the coming decades there will be a further increase in world population which will mainly affect urban areas. These forecasts further underline the need to intervene above all in cities, in order to reduce the effects of the potential threats that can occur as a result of unexpected critical events, both anthropogenic and natural. In recent years, national and local governments have planned to invest significant economic resources in the development and implementation of strategies capable of addressing possible weaknesses in urban systems. In the context of the governance of urban transformations, one of the most commonly used approaches for improving the capacity of urban systems to respond to external stressors refers to the resilience paradigm, understood as the capacity of a system, community or society to resist, absorb, adapt and recover from the impacts of a calamitous event in a timely and efficient manner, including through the preservation and restoration of its essential basic structures and functions. The implementation of solutions aimed at improving urban resilience is essential to reduce the possible economic, social and environmental impacts owing to the critical events that can affect cities. Furthermore, the use of this approach can offer greater security both to citizens and for economic activities, both in ordinary conditions and emergencies. The satisfaction of this need has now become a fundamental element of the competition between different territorial contexts and in particular between cities. The most recent studies on urban competitiveness highlight how the issue of developing urban resilience has become an essential aspect when evaluating the competitive capabilities of various territorial contexts. The development and implementation of interventions aimed at making cities resilient cannot disregard the use of physical and functional smart solutions, which now constitute an essential support in improving the response capacity of cities and their components to internal and external stresses. Making a city resilient requires the implementation of complex infrastructural and organizational interventions which must take into account the multiplicity and dynamism of the urban components involved, and which therefore must make use of the most recent technologies, hardware and software. Taking action on urban resilience can also enable cities to achieve a better level of smartness. The in-depth analysis and considerations brought together in this work are part of this broad scientific debate. In particular, the purpose of this work is to investigate the issues related to the challenges that cities will have to face in the coming decades in order to ensure an adequate quality of life for citizens, highlighting how the use of a resilient approach can improve the response of these territorial contexts in the event of critical situations. The issues of territorial competitiveness and urban smartness are studied in detail in the context of a new scientific, technical and cultural way of thinking which takes resilience as its primary reference paradigm. This is in order to understand how far resilient development is able both to support the improvement of a city's ability to compete with other territorial contexts, and to favour the achievement of an adequate level of urban smartness. The aim is to develop a detailed and up-to-date scientific reference framework regarding the main needs and critical events faced by cities, and the need to promote the use of an approach aimed at improving urban resilience, in the context of dealing with the external and internal stresses and changes which affect these territorial contexts. In other words, the study illustrates the relationships that can be established between the development of the resilient city and, on the one hand, the ability of an urban system to compete with other territorial contexts, and on the other, the potential offered by the use of smart, physical and functional solutions in an urban setting.","",https://doi.org/10.6093/978-88-6887-088-1,"",,

Smart city research is both fragmented and divergent, as is evident from the extensive literature mapping carried out by Mora, Reid and Angelidou in the first article.This finding is not surprising as there is a variety of stakeholders associated with smart cities (academics, policymakers and practitioners), all with different motives and ways to contribute to smart city development.The authors present five different directions of smart city research -experimental, ubiquitous, corporate, European and holistic.All of these paths reflect the technology orientation of existing smart city research.The corporate path is based on the interest of large ICT companies in promoting their products and services as one-sizefits-all solutions to urban problems, while the European path views ICT solutions as important to mitigate climate change and support sustainable urban development through enhancing energy efficiency and carbon neutrality.The rest of the articles in the first part investigate opportunities for smart cities arising from artificial intelligence and deep learning technologies, facilitation of innovation ecosystems and new knowledge creation in smart cities.While these articles offer important insights into technological development, they all emphasize the need for human and collective intelligence to come up with solutions to the complex challenges emanating from urbanization.The chapter by Schaffers presents living labs, crowdsourcing tools, digital platforms and innovation projects as sources of collecting and combining knowledge innovation.It provides a comparison of best practice from Amsterdam, Thessaloniki, Manchester, Barcelona, Helsinki and Ghent.The author acknowledges many existing challenges that hinder true collaboration among stakeholder groups.The chapter also indicates the need for valid measurement to evaluate the effectiveness and impact of existing digital solutions.The second part of the book introduces key technologies (cloud-of-things, blockchain and big data) that facilitate the connection of city infrastructure and applications with citizens themselves.The article from Vakali and Moustaka demonstrates how user-generated content in social media can support the detection of dense areas and land uses and, for example, enhance urban planning, citizen engagement, tourism, ride and car sharing, advertising and marketing in cities.The article from Tsampoulatidis, Bechtsis and Kompatsiaris introduces blockchain technologies as a way to help government agencies to digitise existing records (e.g., birth, death, marital status, business licensing, property transfers and waste management) to enhance data efficiency and transparency.The article from Zhang, Duarte and Ratti demonstrates how big data may be used to improve early detection of diseases and ways of managing their spread.The article also happens to be relevant to the current coronavirus pandemic.The second part of the book highlights further capabilities of new technologies, but also tackles such challenges as data security, privacy and interoperability issues.","",https://doi.org/10.13169/prometheus.36.4.0406,"",,

rayyan-210782165,A Foreword from the Editor,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Low-carbon and intelligent construction are two of the current research hot spots in the Architecture, Engineering, Construction, and Facilities Management (AEC/FM)&nbsp;field.&nbsp;Green building, smart city, AI, BIM, and sustainable development have become high-frequency words in the field[1]. The lack of the adoption of digital technologies (e.g., BIM, AI, digital twin) will lead to project delays, cost inefficiencies, poor quality, and tedious management[2]. Emerging innovations of those digital technologies are bringing a new evolutionary process of engineering applications towards more sustainable and intelligent development[3-4]. In October 2021, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and Global Alliance for Buildings and Construction (GlobalABC) release the heavyweight report Global Status Report on the Building and Construction Industry 2021[1]. The report states that since the signing of the Paris Agreement&nbsp;in 2015, CO2&nbsp;emissions from the buildings and construction sector have peaked in recent years and subsequently fallen to 2007 levels in 2020. This current decline is due mostly to the COVID-19 pandemic; however, this decline appears to be temporary as emissions pick up again with increasing economic activity. Whereas transformative, long-term progress in sector decarbonizing remains limited[1]. To achieve the Paris Agreement, the global buildings and construction sector must almost completely decarbonize by 2050. Collectively, stakeholders in the sector must seize the opportunity that the COVID-19 economic recovery period offers to foster transformation for decarbonizing the sector. The sector must simultaneously meet a projected near-doubling of global demand for energy services in buildings and at least a doubling of floor space as developing economies continue to respond to the growing demand for building floor space, access to energy services and economic activities. Therefore, to meet the future needs and developments of this fast-growing field, a brand-new journal, Journal of Building Design and Environment (JBDE)&nbsp;has been launched. JBDE is a semi-annual, double-blind peer reviewed, open access journal, dedicated to publishing original research articles/reviews—amongst other submission categories—on the research and application of sustainability and intelligence in the field of construction engineering and design. The scope of JBDE covers (but is not limited to) the following: Civil and Infrastructure Engineering Building and Structural Design Construction Materials Built Environment Construction Engineering and Management Computer Aided-Design and Simulation Energy and Buildings Sustainable Development Urban Planningand Resilience Architectural Aesthetics and Townscape To further encourage research in this area, our publisher, Omniscient Pte. Ltd. has decided to waive article processing charge for the first two issues of the journal’s first volume. Therefore, we strongly welcome all who are interested in building design&nbsp;and environment research to join us authors, reviewers or editorial board members. It is the hope of the entire editorial team of JBDE that this journal will fulfil the needs of those specialising in building design and facilitate discourses and advances in the field.","",https://doi.org/10.37155/2811-0730-0101-1,"",,

Planning interventions are now strongly related to internet connectivity, big data exchange, and management, Artificial Intelligent (AI), Internet of Things (IoT), digital advertising, video surveillance, and analytics. As technologies advance, so does the city’s demand for digital infrastructure or commonly labelled as “smart infrastructure”. Digital infrastructure has changed the configuration of urban infrastructure, altering planning space from heavily relies on physical functions to the world that highly depending on digital systems. It improves the efficiency of decision-making processes in most cities. However, the utility of such new approaches remains the question when it comes to their benefits for urban poor and disadvantaged. Current conditions of hitting the COVID-19 pandemic have paralyzed economic and social joints in nearly every country in the world and have worsened the situations in informal settlements as the most vulnerable areas. In their respective capabilities, the government and many elements of society make every effort to overcome the impacts that have occurred that have become known as an adaptation to the “New Normal” situation, including building resilience for urban poor as the most impacted urban populations. All sectors of the economy, banking, telecommunications, transport, public services, and social services are encouraged to undertake major reforms in the types of activities, budget allocations, and work procedures that are shifting from face-to-face (offline) systems of online (online) systems. Numerous questions have followed the great opportunities and challenges faced during the New Normal. How adaptive and anticipative will it be and which new approaches to adopt? How classic infrastructure issues are addressed in this unprecedented COVID-19 situation given restricted funding and scarce resources? How to promote inclusive and sustainable development by connecting people with different socioeconomic backgrounds and geographic locations in the current global pandemic situations? How residents of informal settlements have responded to the situations, given limited access and capacity to connect with the main formal recovery plans? What should be the focus of policymakers, business actors, and society, in general, is responding to climate change and other environmental issues in the new normal era?

The traditional method of resource use involved extraction, making a product and then disposing of the waste, and, often, ultimately the product itself – referred to as ""take, make, dispose"". The result is inefficient resource utilization and production that leads to environmental degradation. Cities can participate in the creation of an economy that results in a more sustainable utilization of resources through energy management in all buildings, more effective waste management and recycling, more energy efficient approaches to design and construction of buildings, facilities, and transportation equipment and systems. The circular economy is clearly needed as we enter the 21st century in which resource availability and the need to integrate all members of society in consumption of the products that are created with it. Solar and wind power and other renewable energy sources have been the first step in this effort. We how speak of smart cities, robotics and artificial intelligence as components in the creation of the economy that the world needs and cities have a central role to play in its development.","",https://doi.org/10.4337/9781839107481.00016,"",,

The current land cover maps of three different years were extracted based on the 2002, 2010 and 2018 Landsat remote sensing images, and the transfer Matrix model wasutilized to analyze the transformation among types of land. The results showed that from 2002 to 2018, the area of cultivated land and construction land in Xichang increased by 20.26% and 191.71% respectively, while the areas of forest land, unused land, grassland and water decreased by 9.36%, 83.27%, 4.48% and 10.45%, respectively. In terms of spatial pattern, the regions with obvious changes are mainly located around the Anning River Valley and Qionghai Lake. The construction land increased significantly, mainly along the Beijing-Kunming expressway to the north of the new urban area and the cultivated land distribution increased slightly on the slope of some low mountain fallow land. Land cover conversion is quite frequent between cultivated land, forestland and grassland. This study can provide a scientific basis for the sustainable utilization of land resources and ecological construction in Xichang city.","",https://doi.org/10.1088/1755-1315/569/1/012060,"",,

Moreover, advances in the Digital Era may also foster citizenship development as shown in the next paper; but at the same time represent a challenge regarding professional skills needed in particular for startups that are growing rapidly in number and size everywhere; so this is context of the next paper. Next paper is a study on the Quality of Life at work based on Leadership Models that in particular shows the positive impacts of a more Participatory Leadership. Next paper shows, through a survey of 396 companies in Brazil, that only a small number of organizations deal with the process of retaining professionals identified as potential successors that no doubt could be very relevant for the organization. Regarding Human Resources next paper is a study based on a Semantic Analysis about possibilities that are opening already, at the recruitment and selection process, by using Artificial Intelligence. Next paper seeks to find relationships between motivation and engagement and project management by means of a bibliometric analysis. For this purpose, was performed a cluster analysis of 529 articles using VOXviewer indicated that motivation in projects is strongly linked to professional development and growth, with increased interest in sustainability and in the relationship with stakeholders represented by the internal and external community of projects; and regarding Organizational Culture next paper shows, through a survey of 109 Organizations in Brazil, the importance of integrating Cultural Diversity in Organizations that may not only help to improve social conditions but also lead to recruiting better talents and leads to greater customer orientation, greater employee satisfaction and better decision making representing a win-win strategy. Still regarding Organizational Culture, and based on Quinn and Rohrbaugh’s model, next paper focus impacts on Competitive Strategy in the Banking Segment following Quinn and McGrath approach. Next paper is a statistical study regarding Fidelity in the Physical Fitness Business, using Logistic Regression and unidirectional ANOVA, that surprisingly show that frequency of use was the most relevant variable related to customer retention, rather than price and membership length. Today’s economic impacts of COVID-!9 is leading Public Policies in Governments like Brazil to drastically reduce Investments in Science and Technology that may end up decreasing the Human Development Index – HDI, as shown by next paper based on a previous study of the performance indicators in Science, Technology and Innovation CT&amp;I in 14 countries including some like Brazil. Today, 55% of the world's population lives in urban areas, a proportion that is expected to increase to 68% by 2050; as a matter of fact by 2050, two-thirds of all humanity will live in urban areas; and higher changes have actually been in Latin America and the Caribbean with 81.2% of the population already living in urban areas, up from 41.3% in 1950. Hence particularly in these regions sustainable development will become fundamental for the management of cities, so next paper dealing with a small city in southern Brazil may be helping as Best Practice Case. The city was able, through Team Works, to developed a Municipal Goals Plan based on the Sustainable Development Goals - SDG and in less than 4 years (2017-2020) 90% of which were reached through Work Teams driven basically by: The engagement of those responsible for2RISUS – Journal on Innovation and Sustainability, São Paulo, v. 12, n.2, p. 1-3, abr./mai. 2021 - ISSN 2179-3565Administrative Management, The importance of planning, at both strategic and operational levels, and the commitment of the teams in the execution of the actions. Actually, Brazil for some time has being already counting with an Open Sustainable Cities Program that help cities to develop its own strategies accordingly. Next paper is a survey of 48 companies in Brazil that using Crunchbase and Iramuteq technologies found three classes of business blockchain impact on Business models: A distributed value structure, a governance structure and an application structure aimed at encrypted and tokens. Next paper coming from Ukraine shows an approach for modelling a System of Balanced Criteria of Business Process Management (BPM), focused on large data volumes with a basic processes implemented using the cloud computing service — math.semestr, that may be promising in terms of automation of business process management. Last paper comes from Malaysia and deals with a trial on Home Buyers´ Willingness to Pay (WTP), using an on-line survey constructed using the LMA design tool provided in the ‘support.CEs’ package that showed that even a small and diversified sample of 20 respondents dealing with home buyer preferences for sustainable housing and analyzed using the package’s clogit function may give some results even for the measurement of a higher number of variables.","",https://doi.org/10.23925/2179-3565.2021v12i2p1-3,"",,

rayyan-210782196,USING CONTEXTUAL CUES IN UNDERSTANDING URBAN MENTAL WELL-BEING,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract. It is well established that city life can impact on individuals’ mental well-being. Factors associated with modes of transport in a city, such as cycle corridors and the reliability of bus network, and environment factors, such as availability of green spaces, have been shown to relate to individuals’ well-being in the city. Smart cities contain a wealth of digital data which has been used in the management and organisation of cities. Such data is gathered from sensors, networks and systems which contain rich insights on factors associated with city life. Such as, for example, the availability of open spaces in the city, traffic congestion, and air quality levels. We propose that these smart city data sources and data flows can act as contextual cues to indicate the mental well-being of individuals in the city. That is, we propose harnessing indicators and patterns in datasets known to be associated with well-being, and using these as contextual cues for automated city well-being level estimation. In this initial investigation, we focus on contextual cues associated with active travel and transportation, environmental information and green infrastructure. We propose an AI-based system which uses these contextual cues to generate an indicator of mental well-being in the city.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/isprs-archives-xlvi-4-w1-2021-85-2021,"",,
rayyan-210782197,"COVID-19, Urban Transportation, and Air Pollution",,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Urban air pollution has severe negative effects on health and the economy, especially in developing and industrializing countries, such as China and India. Although the transportation sector is widely acknowledged as among the largest contributors to urban air pollution, quantifying its causal effects on air pollution is challenging, as decisions to travel are endogenous with air quality. The spread of COVID-19 offers a unique opportunity for causal identification, as the pandemic directly affects decisions to travel but has little direct effect on air pollution. Leveraging the number of COVID-19 infections and COVID-19-related queries to online search engines as instruments for decisions to travel, controlling for two-way fixed effects, we quantify the effects of three public transportation subsectors (buses, railways, and taxis) and private vehicles on six primary air pollutants (CO, NO2, O3, PM2.5, PM10, and SO2) of 36 central cities of China, using two-stage ridge regression and double/debiased machine-learning models. The results demonstrate that the negative effects of urban transportation on air quality are likely to be significantly underestimated without addressing endogeneity in the observational data. After addressing endogeneity, the findings show that every 1% increase in the passenger volume of public transportation and in the congestion index results in about a 0.039% and 0.368% increase in the synthesized air pollution index. Further, our estimates indicate heterogeneous effects across transportation modes and air pollutants. Notably, our work shows that air pollution shifts the demand from mass transportation (i.e., buses) to taxis, which aggravates pollution further. These findings contribute to the literature on the COVID-19 pandemic, transportation, and air pollution, and have implications for sustainable transportation planning, operation, and policy evaluation.","",https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3859071,"",,
rayyan-210782201,AN INTERACTIVE PLATFORM FOR ENVIRONMENTAL SENSORS DATA ANALYSES,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract. The increased usage of the environmental monitoring system and sensors, installed on a day-to-day basis to explore information and monitor the cities’ environment and pollution conditions, are in demand. Sensor networking advancement with quality and quantity of environmental data has given rise to increasing techniques and methodologies supporting spatiotemporal data interactive visualisation analyses. Moreover, Visualisation (Vis) and Visual Analytics (VA) of spatiotemporal data have become essential for research, policymakers, and industries to improve energy efficiency, environmental management, and cities’ air pollution planning. A platform covering Vis and VA of spatiotemporal data collected from a city helps to portray such techniques’ potential in exploring crucial environmental inside, which is still required. Therefore, this work presents Vis and VA interface for the spatiotemporal data represented in terms of location, including time, and several measured attributes like Particular Matter (PM) PM2.5 and PM10, along with humidity, and wind (speed and direction) to assess the detailed temporal patterns of these parameters in Stuttgart, Germany. The time series are analysed using the unsupervised HDBSCAN clustering on a series of (above mentioned) parameters. Furthermore, with the in-depth sensors nature understanding and trends, Machine Learning (ML) approach called Transformers Network predictor model is integrated, that takes successive time values of parameters as input with sensors’ locations and predict the future dominant (highly measured) values with location in time as the output. The selected parameters variations are compared and analysed in the spatiotemporal frame to provide detailed estimations on how average conditions would change in a region over the time. This work would help to get a better insight into the urban system and enable the sustainable development of cities by improving human interaction with the spatiotemporal data. Hence, the increasing environmental problems for big industrial cities could be alarmed and reduced for the future with proposed work.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/isprs-annals-viii-4-w1-2021-57-2021,"",,
rayyan-210782204,John Loxley: Radical Academic Activist,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"In 2014, John Loxley was called as an expert witness for the plaintiffs in a legal case filed in 2007 by the First Nations Child and Family Caring Society (Caring Society) and the Assembly of First Nations (AFN) against the Government of Canada. The case alleged that the Canadian government's choice to underfund child welfare and other children's services on First Nations reserves and in the Yukon amounted to racial discrimination. Loxley's expertise, in that context, derived from a 2005 report (Blackstock et al., 2005) that he had co-authored which found that, despite their higher needs, First Nations children were being funded at a rate 30 per cent lower than other children in Canada. The report proposed a detailed, needs-based funding approach developed with First Nations experts and informed by a survey of all First Nations child and family service agencies. Importantly, the proposed approach reflected best practices in First Nations child welfare and included data collection to better calibrate the funding approach over time. In an attempt to discredit Loxley's work, the Government of Canada hired the accounting firm KPMG to perform a forensic audit of Loxley's costing work, only to find that KPMG's calculations came within 0.025 per cent of his calculations. The KMPG report was filed as evidence for the plaintiffs. Loxley's testimony and his report, coupled with the testimony of First Nations experts, resulted in a landmark 2016 decision by the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal ordering Canada to immediately cease its discriminatory treatment.1 This anecdote, recounted by Cindy Blackstock (herself a tireless advocate for First Nations children), neatly encapsulates what John Loxley was about. Loxley was an outstanding academic, but he was also a brilliant and committed activist ‘who devoted his life to teaching and research directed to changing lives for the better wherever he was’ (Lawrence, 2020: 469). His life's work reflected an extraordinary combination of world-class scholarship and consistent engagement with progressive movements and campaigns. He was just as likely to be working in the community as in a classroom. Ever the pragmatist, he studied and taught how to design real-life policies to improve the lives of those who are left behind by the status quo. As a heterodox economist, he deeply understood capitalism's many deficiencies and contradictions and, wherever and whenever possible, placed his expertise at the service of marginalized groups and individuals to help them challenge, and sometimes overcome, those aspects of the system that left them powerless and unheard. John Loxley's contributions to research, policy and community-based initiatives, include unique and enduring contributions to community economic development (CED), pivotal contributions to the initiation and development of the community-based ‘Alternative Budgeting’ movement in Canada, the study (and critique) of public‒private partnerships (PPPs) and social impact bonds (SIBs) and, throughout his academic career, a leadership role in a vigorous but informed and measured critique (from the left) of the international financial institutions (IFIs) (the World Bank and International Monetary Fund) and, in particular, their role in Africa. But his impact as an activist went well beyond these endeavours. Loxley's values aligned best with those fighting for social justice on the streets and picket lines, but he did not shy away from corporate boardrooms. At the same time that he was working on the board of the grassroots, non-profit group Ogijiita Pimatiswin Kinamatwin (OPK), an Indigenous organization supporting marginalized Indigenous young adults and their families, he sat on the board of the large, multi-billion-dollar Manitoba Hydro crown corporation. John Loxley's unique gift was to bring together a progressive vision of society, rooted in left-wing and social justice perspectives that sought to advance the agendas of workers, the poor and the marginalized, with a pragmatism that enabled him to work with those that did not necessarily share his ideology. John Loxley grew up in working class Sheffield, England, the son of a mother who raised 12 children and a father who worked in the local steel mill and died relatively young of work-related lung disease. From his early years on a council estate, Loxley moved on to grammar school and then to the University of Leeds — the first in his family to do so. Loxley's individual ability enabled him to defy the odds as one of a very small minority of children growing up on a council estate to graduate from university. However, his accomplishments were made possible by the post-World War II Labour Government's implementation of a welfare state with the ambitious platform to address the five giants: ignorance — through universal secondary and post-secondary education; want — through social insurance and income security; disease — through a universal healthcare system based on need not wealth; squalor — through social housing and urban renewal; and idleness — through a policy of full employment. Loxley's subsequent scholarship, in terms of his self-identification as a Marxist and his preference for more radical approaches to economic problems, was strongly influenced by his understanding of class and social stratification, and a belief that the state had the ability and obligation to create a more just society. If the circumstances of his birth and upbringing in Sheffield shaped his perspective on the world and his preference for more radical approaches, by his own admission (Loxley, 2010a), Loxley's experience in Africa, and especially his experience in Nyerere's Tanzania, was central in shaping his understanding of how the world worked and what he could do, both as an academic and an activist, to advance the cause of the disadvantaged, the disempowered and the dispossessed, wherever he encountered them. Loxley's commitment to CED (and his advancement of convergence theory in that regard) can be traced back to his experience in Tanzania. His promotion and leadership of the alternative budget process and his abiding concern with the role of the Bretton Woods Institutions in shaping the development outcomes of developing countries also found their impetus in a set of experiences deriving from that Tanzanian connection. In 1965, Loxley arrived in Africa to complete his doctoral research on the East African monetary and financial system, under Walter Newyln (who was then Director of Economic Research at the East African Institute of Social Research in Uganda). Loxley received his doctorate in 1966 (from University of Leeds), but he remained in Africa for another eight years. In his first two years in Africa, he taught at Uganda's Makerere University. However, from 1967 to 1974 he worked in various capacities in the Tanzanian public sector — first as Chief Economist of the (newly established and publicly owned) National Bank of Commerce (1967–69), then as Senior Lecturer in Economics at Dar es Salaam University (1969–72), and later as Director, and then Head of the Department of Economics, at the Institute of Finance Management in Dar es Salaam (1972–74). These were all remarkably consequential positions for a young man in his late 20s and early 30s. With these jobs came board membership of some of the other newly nationalized ‘parastatals’ (resulting from the proclamation of the Arusha Declaration in 1967) and, given his training in economic planning, participation in the first attempts at socialist economic planning in the Tanzanian context. In the process, he also worked intimately with the Tanzanian leadership and several foreign advisors, many of whom would become lifelong friends and prominent academics and thinkers in their own right. That group includes: Reginald Green, Gerald Helleiner, Lars Osberg, Cranford Pratt, John Saul and Ann Seidman. In these capacities, Loxley had both a ground-floor view of, and active involvement in, a newly independent developing country's attempt at tackling the tripartite challenges of overcoming the legacies of colonialism, engendering growth and development, and constructing the essential elements of a socialist economy. Even when he moved to Manitoba in 1975 Loxley remained, through his former students and associates, deeply connected to the political and economic activities in Tanzania for some time. The fervour, the successes (however transient) and the painful failures attendant with the Tanzanian experience, stayed with Loxley and informed almost every facet of his academic and activist work thereafter. This broad range of first-hand experiences of ‘development in action’ are reflected in Loxley's writing from the late 1960s and the 1970s. He writes about money and banking, of course, and describes the successes derived from the nationalization of the financial system in Tanzania (and its further development) in terms of both increased efficiency and the ability of the new system to redirect the local surplus, that had previously been transferred to London by the colonial banking system, to local use (Loxley, 1972, 1973, 1978). He describes, more broadly, the planning and the organization of financial resources to successfully effect development plans for a socialist Tanzania, the challenges of developing that system of planning, the limitations in terms of human resources, data and institutions and the difficulty of incorporating the parastatal sector into such a planning framework (Loxley, 1972, 1973; Loxley and Saul, 1975). In our view, it was Loxley's experience of the success of public initiatives and the expansion of possibilities that it portended in Tanzania (which, of course, reinforced the role that the British public sector had played earlier in his life) that informed, later on, his distrust of initiatives such as PPPs and SIBs — ideologically motivated devices that sought, in different ways, to provide profit opportunities for the private sector and, in the process, dilute that vital and potentially transformative role of the public sector. While Loxley expressed admiration for Tanzania's formal commitment to socialism and self-reliance, as expressed in the Arusha Declaration of 1967, and its healthy suspicion of imperialism, he pointed out the failure of the governing party (TANU) to articulate ‘a theory of imperialism’ that involved a clear exposition of the nature and causes of underdevelopment and a well-defined national development strategy for achieving said socialism and self-reliance (Loxley and Saul, 1975: 62). In ‘Monetary Institutions and Class Struggle in Tanzania’ (Loxley, 1978), he pointed out that, while public ownership of the financial sector allowed Tanzania to function more efficiently within the inherited economic framework, it had not reduced the relationship of dependence between Tanzania and international capitalism but, instead, increased it. In his words: ‘There has therefore been little change in the economic structure of Tanzania since 1967 as far as its external ties are concerned. Neither has the country's industrialization policy contributed towards an “auto-centered” (Amin) or “convergence” (Thomas) type of growth around strategic basic industries catering for the consumption needs of the people’ (ibid.: 81).2 Loxley's observation of the tenacity of the relationship of dependence in the absence of direct confrontation would inform his later work in CED. In that context, he ultimately chose C.Y. Thomas's ‘convergence’ approach over Samir Amin's ‘auto-centred’ approach in prescribing a path to greater self-reliance at the community level. However, Loxley's most poignant experience relating to Tanzania would occur after his relocation to Canada. In 1981, he was asked to join a group of fellow economists (consisting of both Tanzanian and foreign advisors) in preparing an alternative to the structural adjustment programme being demanded by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), but found wholly unpalatable by the Tanzanian government. Unfortunately, despite the country's dire economic situation, that alternative programme was also not accepted by the Tanzanian government. The ensuing impasse resulted in five years of economic and social hardship, especially for the poor (as Tanzania was forced to adjust without external support), before the IMF offered an adjustment programme that was felt to be palatable. These years of suffering destroyed domestic support for the government and, ultimately, marked the beginning of the end of Nyerere's socialist project. This was a revealing and distressing experience for Loxley. Revealing in the sense that he was alerted to the power and ubiquity of the IMF and World Bank in delimiting the economic experience of developing countries, for better or, more often, worse. Distressing because he recognized the failure of these institutions, when imposing conditionalities and choosing the level and nature of financial assistance, to take adequate cognizance of differing structural features across developing countries, the distributive impacts of these programmes, or the rights of these countries to choose paths that did not preserve the inherited condition of dependence. As he would attest in his acceptance of the John Kenneth Galbraith Prize in Economics in 2010 (Loxley, 2010a),3 almost all his work in development economics, since that time, sought to address, in some form, the role of IFIs in development. Additionally, his experience in the development of an alternative structural adjustment programme (which he later generalized beyond Tanzania's specific challenges) inspired his later work on the Alternative Budgets in Canada (ibid.). John Loxley's reputation outside of Canada largely rested on his academic and policy contributions as a development economist. However, within Canada, Loxley was better known for his pre-eminent contributions in the areas of CED, the alternative federal budget and, particularly in the last decade, his work on PPPs and SIBs. We will cover Loxley's contributions in those areas (drawing largely on the recollections of his colleagues and co-researchers) and end this section with his work in development economics. Loxley moved from Tanzania to Winnipeg (capital of the province of Manitoba in Canada), lured by the prospect of working with the first social democratic government elected in the province. In 1975, one of his primary responsibilities was to lead the Resources and Economic Development (RED) Committee of Manitoba's New Democratic Party (NDP) cabinet, where he quickly identified parallels between the conditions in Africa and the poorer, more remote, more Indigenous areas of the province. The Northern Manitoba that this government inherited was particularly rife with the contradictions of a peripheral economy. On the one hand, abundant natural resources (minerals, forestry and hydroelectric power) generated considerable wealth. However, the surplus from these extractive industries was transferred outside the region. Nickel, copper, zinc and lumber were exported for processing elsewhere. High-voltage power lines served the mines and larger towns in Northern Manitoba, Southern Manitoba, Ontario, Saskatchewan and the United States, bypassing local communities almost entirely. Most of the jobs were filled by whites, mainly recent migrants from Southern Manitoba and other places. As a result, remote and sparsely populated Indigenous communities in the region suffered high rates of poverty, unemployment and social deprivation. Successive governments and industry had reinforced underdevelopment in Northern Manitoba. They painted it as a poor region and a drag on public resources, despite the considerable wealth exported from the region. Predictably, their ‘blaming the victim’ posture was rooted in racist premises (Loxley, 1981: 154). Loxley's development strategy for Manitoba's northern region was ambitiously named ‘The Great Northern Plan’ (Loxley, 1981). The plan itself, though never implemented, represents an important juncture in Loxley's own development as an economist and an activist. It was his first substantive foray into CED and laid the foundation for more than a generation of progressive praxis. Moreover, in this plan, Loxley made a deliberate attempt to actualize what he argued had been missing in Tanzanian development planning. The Great Northern Plan leads off with an effort to theorize ‘on the causes of underdevelopment’ in the north and then goes on to ‘select a development strategy consistent with this analysis’ (Loxley, 2010b: 109). In trying to unearth the cause of Northern Manitoba's underdevelopment, Loxley rejected the explanations proffered by orthodox theories such as dualism, vicious cycles and what he called the ‘subtraction approach’.4 Opting, instead, for a Marxist analysis, he found greater resonance in Mel Watkins's Marxist interpretation of the staple theory, which explains Indigenous dispossession as essential for providing industrial capital with the clear rights that are considered vital for modern resource-extracting industries (Watkins, 1977). Moreover, the institutional apparatus involved (treaties, the Indian Act etc.) also restricted the basic freedom of Indigenous people to engage in economic activities. To address underdevelopment in that context, Loxley found a modified version of the ‘convergence’ approach proposed by C.Y. Thomas (1974) to be particularly apposite. Thomas's strategy is premised on the belief that development, viewed as a process of economic and social transformation, is dependent on the convergence of the population's needs with the supply of available resources. In this context, it is important to note that ‘needs’ go beyond economic ‘demands’, encompassing the need for better education, health and other social services, and a sustainable environment, as well as the need for well-paying jobs and decent incomes. The Great Northern Plan thus mapped out a strategy for ‘a comprehensive economic and social development project for the northern part of the province aimed at transforming the living conditions of one of the poorest sections of Canadian society’ (Loxley, 1981: 151). It was an expressly radical plan, designed to meet the needs of a small, underdeveloped economy in the transition to socialism (ibid.; Thomas, 1974). Use of the north's resources should be redirected to primarily benefit northerners. Local sawmills would provide lumber for construction and manufacturing, thereby reducing the need for costly imports. Self-sufficiency in basic foodstuffs could be achieved within a decade. The plan set out all the elements to make it possible. Local ownership and participation were fundamental to that strategy. However, the plan was never fully implemented, due to a combination of private sector opposition and lack of political will. Even under the administration of a social democratic government such as Manitoba's NDP, the notion of appropriating resource rents from the privately owned corporations in the mining and forestry sectors, and even from the provincially owned hydro electric utility, for investment in local economic and social development, was a non-starter. Accordingly, such investment was left almost entirely to the provincial government, which was subject to increasing fiscal constraints and, in any case, was not too keen to get involved in transformative socio-economic development initiatives that it regarded as the preserve of the private sector. Ironically, it was the past practice of leaving development to the private sector that had created this situation in the first place. Unlike so many who prefer to blame third parties, Loxley argued that the planning team underestimated the economic and political forces they faced (Loxley, 2010b: 120‒21). Nonetheless, ever the optimist and pragmatist, Loxley remained committed to northern, First Nations and inner-city development. Rather than permanently retreat to the safe confines of academia, to await the great revolution that would sweep away the capitalist economic structures that facilitated dispossession and exploitation, Loxley chose to roll up his sleeves and use his considerable gifts to help bring about at least some small victories, in the immediate term, for the dispossessed and disenfranchised. As an economist and academic, Loxley was committed to developing a theory of CED that would advance its study by academics and its application by policy makers (Loxley, 2007). He was driven by an understanding of how CED could improve people's well-being and strengthen entire communities. In ‘The Inclusive Economy’, Loxley defined CED as the ‘community mobilizing to change its economic base and to provide wellbeing for as many community members as possible’ (MRA, 2018). He acknowledged that CED could deliver two different results: a ‘gap-filling’ support for those who were unable to thrive in a capitalist system; or a means to transition to a new system that better shares wealth while protecting the environment and human dignity. These very different visions of the goals of CED create a very big tent, attracting advocates from across the ideological spectrum, but also mean that people are often talking about different things despite using the same term. A crucial component of Loxley's version of CED was the ‘democratization’ of the economy, by having local community members drive the economic decision-making process in a much more direct and egalitarian manner than ‘the one dollar, one vote’ of consumer choice. For Loxley, CED theorists often downplayed class and social divisions, and their accompanying power relationships, resulting in an analysis of a ‘community’ interest that might not genuinely exist given the different economic interests of different groups. It was these divergent interests that made systemic change so difficult, especially because he understood the need for government intervention to get a CED strategy up and running, and the political challenges in promoting such support (Loxley, 2010b: 245‒51). Loxley argued that gap filling was a crucial intermediate step because it made incremental and important improvements in people's lives and sowed the seeds of ever-broader change. Unsurprisingly, Loxley's views of CED were a continuation of his work on the Great Northern Plan, with its intellectual debt to C.Y. Thomas (1974) and to Mel Watkins's (1977) reprisal of the staple theory of Canadian economist Harold Innis (Lamb, 2007). Loxley advocated a convergence strategy to stop the leakage of profits from the community and make them work locally. A community should produce a range of goods in order to develop as many of Innis's backward, forward and final-demand linkages as possible. These goods should also display high growth income elasticities so that as many jobs as possible are generated and the local economy thrives (Loxley, 1985: 51). An example of how convergence theory with strong economic linkages might be operationalized can be found in the Neechi Principles of CED (see Figure 1), articulated by the Winnipeg-based Neechi Foods Co-op Ltd. The Neechi Principles of Community Economic Development Source: Wray Enns (2018: 5) When the NDP returned to power between 1999 and 2016, it integrated the Neechi Principles in the CED approach that it had incorporated into its policy development process. This government ‘buy in’ was the culmination of several factors, including a long tradition, going back to the 1950s, of government support of CED; the ideological bent of the government of the day; the understanding that some high-level bureaucrats (some of whom had been Loxley's students) had about CED and its practical application; and a strong CED community, including a regional office of the Canadian CED Network. Recognizing the importance of supporting organizations aligning with CED, the Province of Manitoba provided core funding to community groups including Neighbourhood Renewal Corporations (NRCs), which, guided by the Neechi Principles, provided services to low-income communities (Fernandez, 2015). By 2015, there were 13 NRCs in eight towns and cities receiving core funding from the provincial government to leverage community support for social enterprise and build capacity for residents in a variety of ways (ibid.). Loxley was prescient in identifying an important vulnerability in the relationship between CED and the state. While CED requires an interventionist state for its support, that very intervention makes CED vulnerable to the changing priorities of different governments (Loxley, 2010b). The NDP's CED framework did not survive its electoral defeat to the free market-oriented Conservative government in 2016 (Fernandez and MacKinnon, 2019). Core funding for organizations doing CED work was either reduced or eliminated completely. Nonetheless, having developed capacity during the NDP's tenure, some organizations continue to survive through the policies, institutions and complementary legislation that helped the establishment of the province's CED and social enterprise sector (Fernandez, 2015). From 2001 until his passing, Loxley was instrumental in providing CED in Manitoba with an academic and institutional home as Principal Investigator of the Manitoba Research Alliance (MRA), a partnership between academics and community members, funded by four successive Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada awards. The MRA demonstrated Loxley's commitment to praxis, not merely studying CED but enacting it as well. The funding for the MRA flows through the local office of the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives (CCPA), a research institute ‘concerned with issues of social, economic and environmental justice’ (CCPA, 2021), allowing the organization to build capacity. Equally importantly, the MRA insists that research must be driven by, and be at the service of, the local community by partnering with community-based organizations. Many of these partnerships have been collaborations with Indigenous communities including Nisichawayasihk Cree Nation, Fisher River Cree Nation, the Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs and other Indigenous-led organizations. The MRA also returned to Loxley's work in the north of the province by analysing the role of CED in the northern city of Thompson. Of particular concern for Loxley was the role that northern First Nations played, and could further develop, to ensure that resources were owned and operated by those Nations and were used to train and employ First Nations members (Deane and Szabo, 2020). There is no doubt that the long thread of CED, both in theory and practice, in Manitoba can be traced back to John Loxley's intellectual leadership and the great respect he garnered in the academy, the government and the community. Loxley's work on alternative budgets began in Winnipeg in the early 1990s as a key member of CHO!CES, a progressive civic coalition that took on many progressive fiscal causes. His contribution to that initiative was facilitated by his experience of actual budget creation processes in Tanzania and the development of an alternative to IMF structural adjustment programmes, but it was crystallized by the recession and austerity budgets of the late 1980s and the1990s in Canada (Loxley, 2010a; Stanford, 2005). This work started small, in his home city of Winnipeg, but was then taken up by progressive coalitions and campaigns across Canada and in other countries, culminating in his Alternative Budget presentations at the United Nations. Loxley's expert input to these alternative budget programmes, and the public credibility which he brought (as a respected economist) to the project, were important. But Loxley's contribution was more than an intellectual understanding of the role that government could play in helping people to improve their circumstances. It was even more than a political understanding of how to challenge the dominant narrative of austerity and cutbacks in the name of fiscal probity. In his fierce commitment to a participatory, democratic process in developing these budgets, Loxley was adamant about listening to the voices of people who were most impacted by the politics of austerity. After all, if the goal of this movement was to empower communities’ capacities to set their own priorities and make their own economic decisions, a process dominated by experts (even progressive ones), in his view, could not fulfil that goal. This insistence on humility — listening to those who were often left out — was fundamental to how alternative budgets were constructed. Loxley worked successfully to balance his own important intellectual and technical contributions to the initiative while developing the confidence and capacities of the broader movement. He summed up this approach in an introduction he wrote for a ‘how-to’ manual on alternative budgeting for CHO!CES: ‘Opening up the [budgeting] process enables people to see how budgets are put together, how trade-offs are made, and to appreciate the real versus imagined budgetary constraints that governments have to work within’ (Loxley, 1998: 7). To mobilize grassroots opposition to fiscal restraint, and to show that viable budgetary alternatives existed, CHO!CES organized community and advocacy organizations to develop their own, alternative city budgets. This strategy allowed the coalition to go beyond merely resisting cutbacks to, instead proposing a complete and comprehensive alternative vision for the city's finances. The strategy was successful in showing that credible alternatives to harsh fiscal austerity were viable — and in demonstrating that community organizations, advocates and ordinary citizens could contribute credibly to budget processes. Soon the practice was replicated at a provincial level (with progressive groups proposing an alternative provincial budget for Manitoba) and for Canada as a whole.

A complex model of a pilot region (Combeima in Ibague, Colombia) has been developed, and the model results are few into equations to estimate fluctuations of SDGs in the region. Running this complex model in real-time, for a mobile application, requires an extensive high-performance computing system linked to large and complex network setup. To solve this problem, a fast yet accurate surrogate model is proposed.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Therefore, this study contemplates an analysis of methods to forecast sustainable development indicators evaluated through climate change scenarios for a period between 1989-2039. The proposed scenarios associated the public health, livestock, agriculture, engineering, education and environment sectors with climate variables, climate change projections, land cover and land use, water demands (domestic, agricultural and livestock) and water quality (BOD and TSS). Generating the possibility that each player can make decisions that represent the actions that affect or contribute to the demand, availability and quality of water in the region.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Consequently, a set of indicators were selected to recreate the dimensions of each sector and reflect its relationship with the Sustainable Development Objectives, as opposed to the decisions made by each player. In addition, three categories were considered for the levels of sustainability: low (0.0 - 0.33), medium (0.34 - 0.66) and high (0.67 - 1.0) for the calculated SDG values.&amp;amp;#160;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Self-learning techniques have been employed in the analysis of decision-making problems. In this study, the nearest K neighbours (k-NN) and a multilayer perceptron network (MLP) were used. Through an analysis based on the responses of the players and sustainability indexes, a multiple correlation analysis was developed in order to consolidate the learning dataset, which was randomly partitioned in proportions 0.7 and 0.3 for the training and test subsets respectively. Subsequently, the model fit and performance was carried out, analysing the MSE error metric and confusion matrix.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Finally, the results of this study will allow to determine the potential of supervised learning models as a decision-making tool for the evaluation of sustainable development, as well as to obtain a better abstraction and representation of the water resource to the challenges related to climate adaptation and water sustainability measures of citizen action, besides generating new approaches for the use of artificial intelligence in land use planning and climate adaptation processes.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu21-13929,"",,

While achieving remarkable economic growth, Vietnam has faced considerable challenges in environmental and resources management. The rapid growth of urbanization and industrialization has placed an increase in pressures on the environments and available resources, through excessive exploitation and use. Further, the utilization, management and use of environment and natural resources have increasingly drawn much attention from both researchers and managers under the effects of global climate change impacts. The application of advance technologies and management practices have become a vital of concern in the age of the 4 th industrial revolution with an emerging of advance technologies. We would like to welcome you to the International Conference on Environment, Resources and Earth Sciences (ICERES 2020) in associated with the National GIS Conference 2020 (GIS for Smart Cities towards Sustainable Development) which the will be held during 1 – 5 December 2020 at Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology (HCMUT), Vietnam National University Ho Chi Minh City. ICERES 2020 is co-organized by HCMUT, Nong Lam University (NLU) and Esri Vietnam in which. The Conference is financially supported by Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology, Vietnam National University Ho Chi Minh City, Nong Lam University and Esri Vietnam. The main objective of the conference is to provide a platform for researchers, academicians, engineers, businessmen, managers, and postgraduate students in the field of environmental and resources management, geospatial technologies, and earth sciences to present their recent studies and latest research results. In addition, this conference aims to provide a setting environment for scientists and managers to exchange new ideas, innovative thinking, and to explore applicable experiences via face-to-face discussions, as well as establishing collaborative research projects or business relations, and to enable partners for their future collaborations. The conference program was organized into ten (10) sessions covering topics of environment and natural resources management, geospatial technologies, and earth sciences, imcluding: Smart Cities, Digital Twin Cities (Cyber Cities), Smart Building; (ii) Application of GIS in State Management; (iii) Disaster Reduction and Risk Management; (iv) Environment, Natural Resources Management and Sustainable Development; (v) 3D GIS, Laser Scanning, and Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR); (vi) Digital Imagery Processing (Satellite, UAV, Air plane); (vii) IoTs, AI, and Big Data for WebGIS; (viii) Integration of Lidar and GIS; (ix) Building Information Model (BIM) Technology; and (x) Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS). Overall, the conference has attracted more than 138 papers, and among them, 46 high-quality papers were recommended to submit for the IOP Conference Series: Earth and Environmental Science proceedings book for peer-reviewing. Then, the double-blind review process was carried out for the 46 papers, in which each paper has been reviewed for its merit and novelty by at least two reviewers and one editor by matching the content areas. As a result, a total of 25 papers have been finally selected for this proceedings book. We believe that this proceedings book provides a broad overview of recent advance studies in the fields of environment, natural resources, disaster reduction and risk management, sustainable development, geospatial technologies (GIS and remote sensing) and earth resources for readers.

rayyan-210782273,Deep Human-guided Conditional Variational Generative Modeling for Automated Urban Planning,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Urban planning designs land-use configurations and can benefit building livable, sustainable, safe communities. Inspired by image generation, deep urban planning aims to leverage deep learning to generate land-use configurations. However, urban planning is a complex process. Existing studies usually ignore the need of personalized human guidance in planning, and spatial hierarchical structure in planning generation. Moreover, the lack of large-scale land-use configuration samples poses a data sparsity challenge. This paper studies a novel deep human guided urban planning method to jointly solve the above challenges. Specifically, we formulate the problem into a deep conditional variational autoencoder based framework. In this framework, we exploit the deep encoder-decoder design to generate land-use configurations. To capture the spatial hierarchy structure of land uses, we enforce the decoder to generate both the coarse-grained layer of functional zones, and the fine-grained layer of POI distributions. To integrate human guidance, we allow humans to describe what they need as texts and use these texts as a model condition input. To mitigate training data sparsity and improve model robustness, we introduce a variational Gaussian embedding mechanism. It not just allows us to better approximate the embedding space distribution of training data and sample a larger population to overcome sparsity, but also adds more probabilistic randomness into the urban planning generation to improve embedding diversity so as to improve robustness. Finally, we present extensive experiments to validate the enhanced performances of our method.","",https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2110.07717,"",,
rayyan-210782413,Regional studies and conceptual fuzziness: A critical review,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Regional and spatial studies, such as urban planning, energy planning, and sustainable development, address the complexity of the inter-disciplinary relationship between subsystems and their components. Such studies require multidisciplinary concepts, varied lenses, and differentiating approaches and models to address the conflict between contextual sensitivity and universal applicability. This paper reviews the debate on the research approaches adopted in regional studies and initiated by researcher Ann Markusen, followed by a review of contemporary literature on the concept of fuzziness in the qualitative research. Markusen evaluated the conceptual fuzziness, empirical evidence, and policy dimensions of regional studies. The argument was based on three fundamental aspects of regional and urban development studies; strong contestation of phenomena, empirical evidence to support the concept, and collective action to deal with the problems under investigation. A conceptual fuzziness and the methodological weaknesses in the qualitative research, highlighted by Markusen almost two decades ago, persist in interdisciplinary qualitative research. In this study, we have dissected the concept of fuzziness to distinguish between Inherited fuzziness derived from the configurational complexity of a case and bequeathed fuzziness that could be transferred ahead due to a researcher’s methodological and perceptual weaknesses. Despite efforts made to address the relevance, reliability, validity, and replicability of the qualitative research, the field is still facing challenges from conceptual bias, methodological and operational constraints, empirical weakness, and prejudiced interpretation.","",https://doi.org/10.25082/ree.2021.01.005,"",,
rayyan-210782415,Sustainable mobility and economic sustainability: the case of the new trolleybus line in Genoa,,1,1,,,,,,,,it,,,"With over 3.5 billion people currently residing in major cities around the world, the issue of urban mobility is a current issue and is particularly important in European countries where over 75% of the population is concentrated in urban areas. Even today, many of the daily journeys depend on cars and other private motorized vehicles, with a strong impact in terms of air pollution, noise and climate change as in the European Union transport is responsible for a quarter of greenhouse gas emissions. Reducing private transport and making urban transport systems greener and more efficient therefore has important benefits: for the health, climate and prosperity of cities. New models of transport and urban accessibility, increasingly oriented towards environmental sustainability, must therefore be adopted; the choice of the transport solution must be made in relation to not only technical but also economic, social and environmental feasibility. Taking a cue from the Call issued in 2018 by the Ministry of Infrastructure and Transport for the selection of urban mobility proposals that can access the economic resources intended for the enhancement and implementation of rapid mass transport systems provided for by Law no. 232/2016, this contribution deals with the evaluation of three transport proposals hypothesized for the connection between the city center of Genoa (Brignole station) and the district of Prato, along the Bisagno Valley, developed according to the indications contained in the Urban Mobility Plan of the Municipality. In particular, a Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) is developed according to the indications given in the Notice and in the Guidelines of the Ministry of Infrastructure and Transport for the evaluation of investments in public works. The objective is to verify the applicability of the CBA tool for assessing the economic and financial sustainability of the solutions analyzed - also in relation to the indications given in the legislation, the transport scenarios configured and the reliability of the results obtained, for the the choice of the transport solution to be adopted. Con oltre 3,5 miliardi di persone che risiedono attualmente nelle grandi città del mondo, il tema della mobilità urbana è una questione attuale ed è particolarmente importante nei paesi europei dove nelle aree urbane si concentra oltre il 75% della popolazione. Ancora oggi, molti degli spostamenti quotidiani dipendono dalle auto e da altri veicoli motorizzati privati, con un forte impatto in termini di inquinamento atmosferico, sonoro e sul cambiamento climatico visto che nell’Unione europea i trasporti sono responsabili di un quarto delle emissioni di gas serra. Ridurre il trasporto privato e rendere i sistemi di trasporto urbani più ecologici e più efficienti presenta quindi dei vantaggi importanti: per la salute, il clima e la prosperità delle città. Nuovi modelli di trasporto e di accessibilità urbana, sempre più orientati verso la sostenibilità ambientale, devono quindi essere adottati; la scelta della soluzione trasportistica deve essere fatta in relazione alla fattibilità non solo tecnica ma anche economica, sociale ed ambientale. Prendendo spunto dal Bando emesso nel 2018 dal Ministero delle Infrastrutture e dei Trasporti per la selezione delle proposte di mobilità urbana che possono accedere alle risorse economiche destinate al potenziamento e alla realizzazione di sistemi di trasporto rapido di massa previste dalla Legge n. 232/2016, il presente contributo tratta della valutazione di tre proposte trasportistiche ipotizzate per il collegamento tra il centro della città di Genova (Stazione Brignole) e il quartiere di Prato, lungo la Val Bisagno, sviluppate secondo le indicazioni contenute nel Piano Urbano di Mobilità del Comune. In particolare è sviluppata l’Analisi Costi-Benefici (ACB) secondo le indicazioni riportate nel Bando e nelle Linee Guida del Ministero delle Infrastrutture e Trasporti per la valutazione degli investimenti in opere pubbliche. L’obiettivo è quello di verificare l’applicabilità dello strumento dell’ACB per la valutazione della sostenibilità economica e finanziaria delle soluzioni analizzate anche in relazione alle indicazioni riportate nella normativa, agli scenari trasportistici configurati e all’attendibilità dei risultati ottenuti, ai fini della scelta della soluzione trasportistica da adottare.","",https://doi.org/10.48264/vvsiev-20212906,"",,
rayyan-210782416,CHAIR-consortium: A collaboration for air pollution research across India,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Ambient air pollution levels in India are among the highest in the world and contribute to climate change and poor health. Despite extreme levels of air pollution and increased frequency and intensity of heat waves in India, current Indian public policy to reduce emissions has been inadequate and lacked a coordinated and sustained effort. Planned coal power plants will additionally contribute to both more CO2 and air pollution emissions. Moreover, lack of monitoring in rural areas has contributed to a belief that air pollution is only an urban problem. To address this we have developed an exposure assessment methodology employing machine-learning methods and multiple data sources including monitoring data, satellite data, meteorology and land-use data to make reliable high resolution predictions of particulate matter <2.5 µm in diameter (PM2.5) and temperature in areas with sparse monitoring. We will develop a nation-wide exposure model for daily ambient PM2.5 and ambient temperature from 2008-2020 at a spatial resolution of 1 km x 1 km and locally at 200 m x 200 m in India. Our aim is to link our national estimates of PM2.5 and temperature to health data to quantify the associations between PM2.5 and ambient temperature, independently and jointly on major public health endpoints. Our specific intention is to make the exposure model an open resource to accelerate environmental epidemiology and build capacity around the many existing health studies in India to which the exposure model can be applied. We will develop an online interactive environmental database and a strategy for stakeholder communication to significantly facilitate decision-making and increase public awareness and engagement. Successful fulfillment of our aims in India will significantly contribute to sustainable development benefitting not only the very large Indian population but also the global community.","",https://doi.org/10.1289/isee.2020.virtual.o-sy-1428,"",,
rayyan-210782417,Covid-19 Pandemic Changes the Recreational Use of Urban Parks in Space and Time: Outcomes from Crowd-Sourcing and Machine Learning,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"The role of urban green spaces for human well-being and health has become crucial during the COVID-19 pandemic. Lockdown measures had a strong impact on the recreational use of urban green spaces. A limited access to urban parks during lockdown decreased the supply and increased the demand in recreational services. However, the effect of COVID-19 pandemic on the spatial-temporal patterns of recreational use within the parks with different landscape structure remains overlooked. In this study, the inter-relationships between landscape structure and changes in recreational use imposed by COVID-19 were investigated for the three different parks in Moscow (Russia). We used machine-learning to analyze social media photos collected for the periods prior, during and after the lockdown (2019 and 2020). Prior pandemic, different spatial (within a park) and temporal (during a year) patterns of photos were mainly explained by landscape structure and availability of infrastructure and facilities. During the pandemic, lockdown was the main factor, distinguishing temporal dynamics in the number of photos with clear minimums during the lockdown and a gradual increase within a month after the lockdown was lifted. In result, the visitation flow restored completely, and the total monthly number of photos after the lockdown was significantly higher than before it. However, the spatial patterns changed, including a higher distance between the photosâ€™ locations and an increased number of photos related to nature observation. These findings demonstrate the crucial role of urban nature as a source of resilience in turbulent times which may have implications in decision-making processes of urban planning","",https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4038022,"",,
rayyan-210782420,Analysing the Pollutants Dispersion in Erbil City-Kurdistan with Support of Statistical Analysis.,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Most of the countries in the world are suffering from the air pollution problem, including both developed and developing countries, due to their urban expansion and overpopulation. Erbil has seen a significant expansion in its population. This was complemented by significant progress in a variety of sectors. The increase in numbers of power generators and increasing the number of cars lead to an increase in the number of pollutants emitted into the atmosphere. This study is concerned with the analyses and evaluation of our air quality in gaseous Pollutants such as CO, NO, NO2 O3, and SO2, then compare the concentrations of these gases with the allowable limits issued by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The dependence of ground-level ozone levels was modelled using statistical analysis and the multiple linear regression approach. The data were obtained from the Board of Environmental Protection and Improvement, Erbil-government-office for 2015 to 2018, which includes the concentration of the pollutants mentioned above and metrological conditions such as (wind direction, wind speed, temperature, air pressure, the relative humidity for the same period. The results show there was some increase in air pollutants. The best prediction equation (R2 = 0.671) presents the dependence of ozone concentration in Erbil city depending on data for two years (2015 and 2016) by utilizing multiple linear regression analysis. The following software was used to analyze and plot the data (Microsoft Excel 2013, WRplot V.7.0.0 and SPSS version 14). References ABDUL-WAHAB, S. A., BAKHEIT, C. S. &amp; AL-ALAWI, S. M. 2005.

rayyan-210782436,Design for the change before behaviour,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Local governments around the world are spending millions to monitor, analyse and visualise air pollution using smart technologies; however, data and visualisations can only be effective if equally strong actions are taken to improve air quality. This thesis critically analyses the often reductionist technological approaches to, and narratives of, smart cities which are aimed at addressing air pollution and mitigating the effects of climate change, with a focus on two main areas. First, it offers evidence-based practical alternatives to these approaches and suggests how future work in this field might expand this narrow design space. Second, it examines and applies in practice a number of social psychology and behaviour change insights, to understand the most appropriate ways of helping people transition to zero- and low-pollution lifestyles through the design of new technology enablers and through collective action.

Mitigation-focused actions will not be enough to address the complexity and severity of the air pollution challenge alone. This enquiry focuses on using design research practices to develop a set of technology experiments or enablers that could shift the focus from pollution monitoring (measuring pollution that has already been produced) to pollution prevention (pre-empting pollution before it is produced). Current sensing and data visualisation projects in the fields of design for behaviour change, human-computer interaction (HCI) and persuasive technologies often either focus on 1) the behaviour while it is being performed or 2) reporting about the behaviour that has already been performed. The prevention-focused technology design experiments in this PhD set out to understand the moment or space right before a behaviour occurs. Through this enquiry, it is argued that a technology enabler can be designed to address
this moment or space and intervene to gain time for and enable a deliberate pause between people’s ‘auto-pilot’ behaviours and more effortful considerations of their day-to-day activities; their usual behaviour can be disrupted and shifted to a new behaviour. But this shift is only possible if 1) the right advice is designed and delivered at 2) the right time with 3) the right frequency, and in 4) the right place and context. Moreover, while it is difficult to identify and address all the reasons for the discrepancy between people’s values and intentions and their actual behaviours or actions, this thesis also argues that technology enablers could help in efforts of closing the ‘value-action’ gap and deliver feedback to a space where it was previously missing. 

In alignment with these findings, and because of their widespread use in people’s homes, this thesis tests current home artificial intelligence (AI) assistants and applies them to deliver a set of behavioural and psychological insights in practice. The four design experiments described in this thesis offer new socially and environmentally minded adaptations to these assistants. They shed light on potentially more meaningful types of interactions with these technologies, demonstrating how they could engender a more proactive role for citizens in enabling positive social and environmental change.

In the first two experiments, a new skill is applied to an existing AI assistant technology. In the second, the author takes on the role of an AI assistant, to better understand her participants’ view on air pollution, the climate crisis and sustainability in general: what they value and prioritise in their daily lives, social practices and behaviours, and what activities they might be willing to change. In the third experiment, a new design method and custom-built, digital assistant or social companion known as Climate Pal (CP) is developed with a group of participants. This demonstrates the potential role of home assistant technologies to increase the degree of participation in pre-empting pollution in cities and help people articulate their own agency in complex environmental matters. The final experiment offers a new alternative to further increasing people’s agency by connecting them through a network of home assistant
devices to a group of like-minded people, so they could enable and take collective social and environmental action together. This new approach tests whether the social aspect of the intervention makes participants’ engagement and the changes in their behaviour more durable than if the intervention were to be focused solely on individual action. The outcomes point to the need for new technology designs that account for and support participants’ core values and desire for social connection and belongingness, for being challenged by, and learning from, others; for doing good for other people; working towards a shared goal; and becoming part of something greater than themselves.

This PhD sets out to design technologies that increase people’s agency in taking meaningful social and environmental action, individually as well as collectively. The aim of this is to overcome the perception that small changes by individuals are somewhat futile when it comes to the inaction of a whole world of other people. The four design research experiments result in a new set of technology design principles for others to use. By moving beyond passive observation of pollution and energy use through air quality sensing technologies, clean air route-finder apps and smart metres, this set of design principles aims to enhance people’s agency and establishes a new, prevention-focused technology design approach that can help reduce polluting and energyintensive behaviours before they even happen. The work has value for those designing for agency and behaviour change, as well as governments and local authorities interested in improving pollution, and for designers involved in developing emerging AI technologies and
improving human-computer interaction.","",,"",,
rayyan-210782438,Using Numerical Simulation and Artificial Neural Networks to Investigate the Influence of Flood Control Infrastructures,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"In recent years, global warming has increased the frequency and severity of extreme storm events, super typhoons, and short-duration and high-intensity rainfall events. Along with the growing awareness of sustainable development, Low Impact Development (LID) techniques are advocated to mitigate the impact on the environment to reduce surface runoff and to reduce the heat island effect. The main purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of different stormwater facilities for different storm sizes on urban areas. The study areas are the flood-prone areas of Tu-Cheng downstream. In this study, four different cases are designed for comparison with the LID approach, including non-stormwater facilities, drainage channels with lower (silty loam) or higher (sandy clay load) infiltration rates, and drainage channels with lower infiltration rates and retention storage ponds. The FLO-2D model is applied for two-dimension flood distribution on the study areas of different designed cases, and Self-Organizing Map (SOM) is used to categorize the simulation data into a meaningful and visible inundation topology for displaying the regional flood inundation extents and severity of these four cases.Keywords:Artificial Neural Networks, Self-Organizing Map (SOM), Numerical Simulation, FLO-2D, Flood mitigation facilities, Flood InundationOverview:1. IntroductionAbout three to four typhoons hit Taiwan every year and the average annual rainfall is about 2,500 mm. The rainfall is concentrated in May to November each year which brings abundant water to Taiwan. However, due to the high development of Taiwan's cities, the buildings are so dense that the impervious areas are almost covered. In the whole city, the land use has exceeded the load of the natural environment, the soil permeability is poor and the surface runoff has greatly increased, resulting in insufficient drainage facilities to discharge and cause flooding. Therefore, how to increase the urban water retention rate and reduce the impact of urban development on the environment becomes one of the major issues for water resources management.2. PurposeTaking the flooding in the Tu-Cheng area as the research object, the numerical software FLO-2D is used to establish the flooding situation generated by different combinations of Low Impact Development facilities and to explore the best flood reduction effect by LID facilities. In addition, Self-Organizing Map (SOM) is used to carry out the cluster analysis to explore the correlation characteristics of flood mitigation factors with flooding conditions. Finally, it is expected that the results of this analysis can effectively solve the problem of urban flooding.3. Study areaTu-Cheng district is a municipal district of New Taipei City, with a population of about 240,000 and an area of about 30 square kilometers. It is located in the southwest corner of the Taipei Basin, and the northeast corner is adjacent to Banqiao District. The Southeast is backed by mountains and faces the water. Its location map is listed as vulnerable to flooding. Due to the highly developed and densely populated areas, the loss of flooding can be quite heavy.4. Methodology4.1 FLO-2DThis model is a two-dimensional flood disaster simulation model developed by an American company. It uses a one-dimensional variable flow model and a two-dimensional overland flow model to simulate one-dimensional flow, street flow, and two-dimensional overland flow. When the overflow occurs, the interaction mechanism between the channel outside the embankment and the surface of the embankment can be calculated which can effectively simulate the flooding situation. The model channel calculation method is to use the continuous equation and the dynamic wave model to simulate the finite difference method, simulate the speed and depth of fluid flow and estimate the reasonable submerged area as a flood disaster prediction tool.4.2 Self-Organizing Map (SOM)The SOM, introduced by Kohonen (1982), is a useful clustering method that can classify a large set of high-dimensional data to form a meaningful topological map derived from the low-dimensional (usually two-dimensional) output layer of the network. The topological map can be used to visibly conduct an assessment of the behavior of input variables and the multi-relations among variables through the constructed clusters. The SOM has advantages of information extraction and visualization and has been widely used in water resources problems. 4.3 Low Impact Development (LID)The main purpose of LID is to apply flood retention, infiltration and evaporation that are common in current drainage design and planning, and to increase urban park green space, so as to delay the flood peak when floods come and reduce flood volume to maintain the hydrological state before land development as much as possible.5. Expected resultsThis study is to collect the elevation date distributed in the Tu-Cheng urban area, the rainfall data from the Tu-Chung rainfall stations, and the satellite imagery to build houses, roads and channels. Besides, the purpose is to explore the effect of different flood mitigation facilities on urban flooding. Taking the flooding situation in the downstream easily flooded area of Tu-Chung district as the research object, the numerical software FLO-2D simulated the flooding situation of different flood mitigation facilities. The flood reduction effect of the combination of LID facilities, and use the SOM to conduct cluster analysis to observe the interactive relationship between the trend of flooding and the factors of flood mitigation facilities, and provide the lowest environmental damage and can improve its maximum reduction. 6.

rayyan-210782454,Global contribution of JAR to a more disaster‐resilient society,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"In recent years, Japan has been repeatedly exposed to natural disasters such as extremely large and violent typhoons (tropical cyclones), torrential rain, etc. Western Japan was hit by torrential storms in 2018, and eastern and northern Japan in 2019. These brought record-breaking rainfall and winds to multiple areas, causing landslides, flash flooding, inundation, etc. An event that a Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) official describes as “heavy rain at a level we have never experienced” repeats every year! They are the worst rain disasters we have seen, causing the highest death tolls due to rainfall in the last three decades or more in Japan. This also left a large number of people without electricity and communication. Even a high-rise tower condominium in the urban center continued to experience electricity and water outages for a long time after the storm because the electrical systems in the basement had been damaged by flooding. As global warming progresses, Japan is likely to face more frequent heavy rains. Huge earthquakes of the same level as the 2011 Great East Japan earthquake have been also another critical threat to Japan. Scientists and citizens are apprehensive about predictions of a super-huge Nankai Trough earthquake expected in the mid-2000s. As has been well recognized, disasters evolved over time. The evolution of modern cities creates convenient and efficient human lifestyles but it may also create unexpected vulnerability to disasters, which we may be suddenly exposed to. Natural hazards are inevitable, but their impacts can be mitigated through proactive and reactive approaches. In the earthquake engineering community that I have been deeply involved with, various, long, and extensive efforts have been made such as the development and revision of seismic codes for building construction, seismic evaluation and rehabilitation techniques for existing buildings, and development and practical application of innovative technologies for both, etc. In addition to these conventional efforts, modern society existing under complex social systems with advanced technologies may also need immediately applicable research outputs as well as fundamental researches to make society really disaster-resilient and to minimize the disruption of societal activities after an event. To this end, comprehensive researches under industry-academia-government cooperation are ongoing in Japan. They are utilizing cutting-edge technologies from various related fields such as ICT, AI, satellites and drones, sensing, high-performance computing as well as the most updated scientific knowledge. The Cross-ministerial Strategic Innovation Promotion Programs (SIP and SIP2) that were launched to contribute to a safer and more resilient society for future generations is one such research effort. Another key factor is not falling into the so-called technological “valley of death” due to a gap between academic research and societal implementation. These problems and the proposed solutions to make society more disaster-resilient are not local to Japan and should, therefore, be shared among related countries and regions. In recent years, more efforts have been increasingly directed toward mutual understanding and knowledge sharing through international collaboration and joint researches between developed and developing countries. The best solution in one area may not always be so in another area and it may often need to be customized to fit the needs and availability of each societal environment. As has been noted in the earlier Editorial, the Japan Architectural Review: the International Journal of the Japan Architectural Review for Engineering and Design is an open access journal. Your articles published in the journal undoubtedly contribute to solving such global issues. All AIJ members are therefore strongly encouraged to submit your articles to JAR and to share your research outputs and ideas with the world.","",https://doi.org/10.1002/2475-8876.12145,"",,
rayyan-210782456,"Aplicaciones de Copernicus para ciudades verdes, saludables y resilientes en el contexto de la emergencia climática",,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"espanolLas ciudades tanto en Europa como a nivel global se encuentran actualmente en un contexto de profundos retos socioeconomicos y ambientales. Son una de las principales fuentes de emisiones y presiones sobre el medio ambiente, a la vez que sufren tambien en un alto grado las consecuencias de la contaminacion y degradacion ambiental asi como los efectos del cambio climatico. Esta situacion requiere como respuesta unas politicas de mitigacion y adaptacion que deben basarse en evidencias cientificas y propuestas tecnicas complejas, como pueden ser soluciones basadas en la naturaleza que pueden mejorar la calidad del aire o proteger contra inundaciones u olas de calor. Las evidencias cientificas a su vez se basan en la toma y analisis de datos. La toma de datos homogeneos y estandarizados es un reto tecnologico que muchas administraciones publicas tienen que afrontar sin los recursos suficientes. Para paliar esta situacion han ido surgiendo soluciones de toma, analisis y sintesis de datos provenientes de la teledeteccion. En particular, destaca Copernicus, el programa de Observacion Terrestre de la Comision Europea, que proporciona datos satelitales y servicios especificos, de forma gratuita y abierta. Esta comunicacion cientifica presentara diferentes aplicaciones de Copernicus que ayudan a apoyar politicas de mitigacion y adaptacion al cambio climatico, y de creacion de ciudades saludables. Tambien, se presentaran los servicios de Copernicus sobre Cambio Climatico (C3S), Atmosfera (CAMS) y Cobertura Terrestre (CLMS) que estan a disposicion de usuarios publicos y privados para crear aplicaciones y soluciones tecnologicas sostenibles. Adicionalmente, se llevara a cabo, una revision de casos de exito de dichas aplicaciones en ciudades espanoles. Este trabajo tendra como objetivo mostrar las posibilidades que ofrece la informacion generada por el programa Copernicus, las aplicaciones que actualmente se estan desarrollando y su potencial para el diseno de herramientas que ayuden en el diagnostico y solucion de los complejos problemas que afectan las areas urbanas y territorios adyacentes por la expansion urbana. Finalmente, esta comunicacion ofrece una vision sobre desarrollos tecnologicos emergentes en este contexto como el uso de Big Data e Inteligencia Artificial en datos satelitales. EnglishCities in Europe and globally are dealing with a context of profound socio-economic and environmental challenges. They are an important source of emissions and environmental 139 pressures, but, at the same time, suffer from the consequences of pollution and environmental degradation as well as the effects of climate change. As a response, this situation requires mitigation and adaptation policy-making, based on scientific evidence and complex technical proposals, such as nature-based solutions, to improve air quality or prevent flooding and heat waves. The scientific evidence is based on data collection and analysis. The homogeneous and standardized collection of data is a technological challenge that face many public authorities in times of scarce resources. Different solutions of data collection, analysis and synthesis from Earth Observation have been developed to ease this situation. Particularly, Copernicus, the European Space Programme, offers a wealth of satellite data and thematic services for this context with a free and open data policy.

rayyan-210782465,A method for calibrating measurement data of micro air quality monitor based on MLR-BRT-ARIMA combined model,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract In recent years, air pollution has become an increasingly important issue in the sustainable development of cities. Monitoring air pollutants is of great significance for government departments to effectively control air pollution. The development of micro air quality monitors provides the possibility for grid monitoring and real-time monitoring of air pollutants. However, affected by many factors, the measurement accuracy of the micro air quality monitors need to be improved. In this paper, a combined prediction model of Multiple Linear Regression, Boosted Regression Tree and AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average model (MLR-BRT-ARIMA) is proposed to calibrate the measurement data of the micro air quality monitor. First, the multiple linear regression model is used to find the linear relationship between the concentration of various pollutants and the measurement data of the micro air quality monitor and obtain the predicted value of the concentration of various pollutants. Second, take the measurement data of the micro air quality monitor and the prediction value of the multiple regression model as the input, and use the boosted regression tree to find the nonlinear relationship between the concentrations of various pollutants and the input variables. Finally, the autoregressive integrated moving average model is used to extract the information hidden in the residual sequence, and finally the establishment of the MLR-BRT-ARIMA model is completed. This combined model combines the advantages of multiple linear regression and boosted regression trees. It can not only give the quantitative relationship between the explained variables and their influencing factors, but also the prediction accuracy is higher than the multiple linear regression and boosted regression tree models alone. Using the ARIMA model to correct the residuals can further improve the prediction accuracy of the model. Root mean square error, mean absolute error and relative mean absolute percent error are used to compare the calibration effect of MLR-BRT-ARIMA model and other commonly used models such as multilayer perceptron neural network, support vector regression machine and nonlinear autoregressive models with exogenous input. The results show that no matter what kind of pollutant, the MLR-BRT-ARIMA combined model proposed in this paper has the best performance in the three indicators. Using this model to calibrate the measurement value of the micro air quality monitor can improve the accuracy by 82.4%~95.4%.","",https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-2150617/v1,"",,
rayyan-210782478,Advancing terrestrial biodiversity monitoring with satellite remote sensing in the context of the Kunming-Montreal global biodiversity framework,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract Satellite remote sensing (SRS) provides huge potential for tracking progress towards conservation targets and goals, but SRS products need to be tailored towards the requirements of ecological users and policymakers. In this viewpoint article, we propose to advance SRS products with a terrestrial biodiversity focus for tracking the goals and targets of the Kunming-Montreal global biodiversity framework (GBF). Of 371 GBF biodiversity indicators, we identified 58 unique indicators for tracking the state of terrestrial biodiversity, spanning 2 goals and 8 targets. Thirty-six shared enough information to analyse their underlying workflows and spatial information products. We used the concept of Essential Biodiversity Variables (EBV) to connect spatial information products to different dimensions of biodiversity (e.g. species populations, species traits, and ecosystem structure), and then counted EBV usage across GBF goals and targets. Combined with published scores on feasibility, accuracy, and immaturity of SRS products, we identified a priority list of terrestrial SRS products representing opportunities for scientific development in the next decade. From this list, we suggest two key directions for advancing SRS products and workflows in the GBF context using current instruments and technologies. First, existing terrestrial ecosystem distributions and live cover fraction SRS products (of above-ground biomass, ecosystem fragmentation, ecosystem structural variance, fraction of vegetation cover, plant area index profile, and land cover) need to be refined using a co-design approach to achieve harmonized ecosystem taxonomies, reference states and improved thematic detail. Second, new SRS products related to plant physiology and primary productivity (e.g. leaf area index, chlorophyll content &amp; flux, foliar N/P/K content, and carbon cycle) need to be developed to better estimate plant functional traits, especially with deep learning techniques, radiative transfer models and multi-sensor frameworks. Advancements along these two routes could greatly improve the tracking of GBF target 2 (‘improve connectivity of priority terrestrial ecosystems), target 3 (‘ensure management of protected areas’), target 6 (‘control the introduction and impact of invasive alien species’), target 8 (‘minimize impact of climate change on biodiversity’), target 10 (‘increase sustainable productivity of agricultural and forested ecosystems’) and target 12 (‘increase public urban green/blue spaces’). Such improvements can have secondary benefits for other EBVs, e.g. as predictor variables for modelling species distributions and population abundances (i.e. data that are required in several GBF indicators). We hope that our viewpoint stimulates the advancement of biodiversity monitoring from space and a stronger collaboration among ecologists, SRS scientists and policy experts.","",https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.04.25.489356,"",,

rayyan-210782518,Design culture for Sustainable urban artificial intelligence: Bruno Latour and the search for a different AI urbanism,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract The aim of this paper is to investigate the relationship between AI urbanism and sustainability by drawing upon some key concepts of Bruno Latour’s philosophy. The idea of a sustainable AI urbanism - often understood as the juxtaposition of smart and eco urbanism - is here critiqued through a reconstruction of the conceptual sources of these two urban paradigms. Some key ideas of smart and eco urbanism are indicated as incompatible and therefore the fusion of these two paradigms is assessed as an unstable basis for shaping sustainable AI urbanism. The concepts in question - modernity, science and nature – are subsequently redefined following Latour’s philosophical perspective, in an attempt to define a different theoretical basis for a sustainable AI urbanism in the Anthropocene. Finally, the principles of a design philosophy shaped by Latour are used to change the design culture that informs AI urbanism towards a more sustainable practice. This paper constructs and promotes a dialogue between the disciplines of philosophy and urban theory with urban design in the conviction that the principles produced by the former and the practices carried out by the latter must start a biunivocal relationship. The paper reveals that in order to change design culture in the field of AI urbanism, it is necessary to rethink some of the key ideas that inform the Western and modern worldview through novel philosophical reflections.","",https://doi.org/10.1007/s10676-024-09752-y,"",,

This study focuses on the construction process data of key landscape nodes along Nanjing’s urban rivers. By employing a whole life cycle emergy approach and carbon emission method, the sustainable changes in the landscape system are quantitatively assessed. Furthermore, artificial neural networks have been used to conduct long-term sustainability analysis and predictions for the landscape system. The research findings reveal that over time, the maintenance investment in landscape projects gradually becomes dominant, increasing from 2% in the first year to approximately 75% after 30 years. This phenomenon signifies a decline in the efficiency of the landscape system. Sustaining the ecological balance of the landscape system necessitates continuous inputs of material flow, energy flow, and information flow. The major contributors to carbon emissions in the landscape engineering system are diesel fuel, cement, and steel. This highlights opportunities for sustainable improvement from a low-carbon perspective. To enhance the ecological sustainability of urban waterfront landscapes, three measures are proposed: sponge city construction concepts, coupled sewage treatment systems, and information flow monitoring systems. The effectiveness of these measures was preliminarily validated.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/buildings14020386,"",,

rayyan-210782572,AI-Driven Approach for Enhancing Sustainability in Urban Public Transportation,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"The functioning of modern urban environments relies heavily on the public transport system. Given spatial, economic, and sustainability criteria, public transport in larger urban areas is unrivaled. The system’s role depends on the quality of service it offers. Achieving the desired service quality requires a design that meets transport demands. This paper uses a data-driven approach to address headway deviations in public transport lines and explores ways to improve regularity during the design phase. Headway is a critical dynamic element for transport organization and passenger quality. Deviations between planned and actual headways represent disturbances. On lines with headways under 15 min, passengers typically do not consult schedules, making punctuality less crucial. Reduced headway regularity affects the average travel time, travel time uncertainty, and passenger comfort. Ideally, the public transport system operates with regular headways. However, disturbances can spread and affect subsequent departures, leading to vehicle bunching. While previous research focused on single primary disturbances, this study, with the help of AI (reinforcement learning), examines multiple primary disturbances in the cities of Belgrade, Novi Sad, and Niš. The goal is to model the cumulative impact of these disturbances on vehicle movement. By ranking parameter influences and using the automatic optimization of static line elements, this research aims to improve headway regularity and increase system resilience to disturbances. The results of this research could also be useful in developing adaptive public transport management systems that leverage AI and IoT technologies to continuously optimize headway regularity in response to real-time data, ultimately enhancing service quality and passenger satisfaction.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/su16177763,"",,

Thus, using a deep learning approach that considers morphological variables, this study predicts UHI intensity in 69 European cities from 2007 to 2021 and projects UHI impacts for 2050 and 2080. The research employs Artificial Neural Networks, Deep Neural Networks, and Gated Recurrent Units, combining high-resolution 3D urban models with environmental data to analyze UHI trends. The results indicate strong associations between urban form, weather patterns, and UHI intensity, highlighting the need for customized urban planning and policy measures to reduce UHI impacts and foster sustainable urban settings. This research enhances understanding of UHI dynamics and serves as a valuable tool for urban planners and policymakers to address the challenges of climate change, urbanization, and air pollution, ultimately aiding in the improvement of health outcomes and building energy consumption. Moreover, the methodology effectively demonstrates the ability of the GRU to link its scores with UHI projections, offering crucial insights into potential health impacts.","",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.uclim.2024.102061,"",,

Although previous research has mainly focused on changes in ecological service value caused by land use, a comprehensive understanding of ecology–economy harmony and ecological compensation remains elusive. To address this, we employed a coupled deep learning model (convolutional neural network-gated recurrent unit) to simulate the ecological service value of the Wuwei arid oasis over the next 10 years. The ecology–economy harmony index was used to determine the priority range of ecological compensation, while the GeoDetector analyzed the potential impact of driving factors on ecological service value from 2000 to 2030. The results show the following: (1) The coupled model, which extracts spatial features in the neighborhood of historical data using a convolutional neural network and adaptively learns time features using the gated recurrent unit, achieved an overall accuracy of 0.9377, outperforming three other models (gated recurrent unit, convolutional neural network, and convolutional neural network—long short-term memory); (2) Ecological service value in the arid oasis area illustrated an overall increasing trend from 2000 to 2030, but urban expansion still caused a decrease in ecological service value; (3) Historical ecology–economy harmony was mainly characterized by low conflict and potential crisis, while future ecology–economy harmony will be characterized by potential crisis and high coordination. Minqin and Tianzhu in the north and south have relatively high coordination between ecological environment and economic development, while Liangzhou and Guluang in the west and east exhibited relatively low coordination, indicating a greater urgency for ecological compensation; (4) Geomorphic, soil, and digital elevation model emerged as the most influential natural factor affecting the spatial differentiation of ecological service value in the arid oasis area. This study is of great significance for balancing economic development and ecological protection and promoting sustainable development in arid areas.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/rs15163927,"",,
rayyan-210782627,A Hybrid Approach Based on GAN and CNN-LSTM for Aerial Activity Recognition,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), known as drones, have played a significant role in recent years in creating resilient smart cities. UAVs can be used for a wide range of applications, including emergency response, civil protection, search and rescue, and surveillance, thanks to their high mobility and reasonable price. Automatic recognition of human activity in aerial videos captured by drones is critical for various tasks for these applications. However, this is difficult due to many factors specific to aerial views, including camera motion, vibration, low resolution, background clutter, lighting conditions, and variations in view. Although deep learning approaches have demonstrated their effectiveness in a variety of challenging vision tasks, they require either a large number of labelled aerial videos for training or a dataset with balanced classes, both of which can be difficult to obtain. To address these challenges, a hybrid data augmentation method is proposed which combines data transformation with the Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based feature augmentation method. In particular, we apply the basic transformation methods to increase the amount of video in the database. A Convolutional Neural Network–Long Short-Term Memory (CNN-LSTM) model is used to learn the spatio-temporal dynamics of actions, then a GAN-based technique is applied to generate synthetic CNN-LSTM features conditioned on action classes which provide a high discriminative spatio-temporal features. We tested our model on the YouTube aerial database, demonstrating encouraging results that surpass those of previous state-of-the-art works, including an accuracy rate of 97.83%.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/rs15143626,"",,

Using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) based urban growth simulation model and landscape metrics, this study aims to evaluate the spatial extent and direction of urban growth and demarcate an Urban Growth Boundary (UGB) by examining the future contiguous expansion of the city for implementing effective land use provision. Utilizing data on biophysical, proximity, neighborhood, and market factors over the past twenty years, the neural network with Markov chain model allocates the land demand for buildup area by 2020 and 2030, concerning twelve explanatory variables. The simulated map of the urban area is further used by landscape metrics to quantify local-level urban patch information viz. landscape pattern, size, aggregation, etc. The compact patch characteristics are mostly found under the Kotwali thana, while, fragmented and unstructured patches are prevailing between urban–rural interfaces. Finally, there has around 95 km2 gap between the existing service provided by KCC and the future demand of Khulna city, creating an imbalance between the supply and demand of urban services. Hence, restricted urban growth would make government investment in service facilities cost-effective and enable planners and decision-makers to intend a feasible trade-off between future land demand and the protection of natural resources.","",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2023.e16272,"",,

To that end, two LULC scenarios known as business as usual (BAU) and protection-based (PB) plan were applied for 2028, using the Markov Artificial Neural Network and Multi-objective land allocation (MOLA) models. The results show that rapid urbanisation, caused by the expansion of human settlements and industrial areas, has led to a decline in the ESs in the region. Compared to the ESs in 2017, the service of water yield increases as urban expansion increases, whereas food production and recreation services decrease as urban expansion increases, under the BAU scenario. On the other hand, in the PB scenario, relatively better conditions can be observed for all three ESs. Considering that the ecological structures of this region have been severely affected by rapid urban expansion, the results of this research will be useful for maintaining the existing ESs and can greatly affect planning and decision-making regarding future development towards urban sustainability.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/land12020291,"",,

The urban population has been severely affected by this viral pandemic and the ensuing lockdowns, resulting in increased poverty and inequality, slowed economic growth, and a general decline in quality of life. This paper proposes a framework to evaluate the effects of the pandemic by combining agent-based simulations-based on Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) model-with a hybrid neural network. A baseline agent-based model (ABM) incorporating various epidemiological parameters of a viral pandemic was developed, followed by an additional functional layer that integrates factors like agent mobility restrictions and isolation. It is inferred from the results that low population densities of agents and high restrictions on agent mobility could inhibit the rapid spread of the pandemic. This framework also envisages a hybrid neural network that combines the layers of convolutional neural network (CNN) and long-short-term memory (LSTM) architecture for predicting the spatiotemporal probability of infection spread using real-world pandemic data for future pandemics.

However, traditional on-site waste characterization techniques require specialized professionals, who are exposed to biological, chemical, and physical risks. In this sense, the use of artificial neural networks (ANN) in models for characterizing municipal solid waste has been discussed, especially after the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic. Predictions made by ANN can be carried out with little or no handling of waste, making the process faster, cleaner, and safer. However, ANN models rely on datasets often provided by third parties, so they require diligent monitoring to ensure that an updated dataset is available at the appropriate regularity. This study presented two standard ANN models that were not available due to a lack of up-to-date datasets and demonstrated that dataset interchangeability may be critical for the long-term use of ANN developed to achieve SDG. Furthermore, interchangeability led to the formulation of a hypothesis about the relevance of the variable associated with basic sanitation in the greater assertiveness of one of the models during the pandemic period, resulting in the identification of abnormal patterns relating to the disposal of textiles and sanitary papers in the years 2020 and 2021. Additionally, this study can be the starting point for the development of more sophisticated interchangeable models developed with alternative datasets, meticulously chosen to reduce the effective error of the desired predictions by reducing the amplitude of the intersection set formed by different models.","",https://doi.org/10.1590/s1413-415220230085,"",,

The radical digitization of the AEC industry, enabled by BIM and AI, has contributed to the emergence of “smart cities”, which uses information technology to improve urban operational and sustainable efficiency. Few studies have investigated the roles of AI and BIM in AEC from the perspective of sustainable buildings in assisting designers to make sustainable decisions at building and city levels. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to explore the research status and future development trends in the relationship between AI and BIM-aided sustainable building in the context of the smart city to provide researchers, designers, and technology developers with potential research directions. This paper adopted a macro and micro bibliographic method, which is used to map out the general research landscape. This is followed by a more in-depth analysis of the fields of sustainable design, sustainable construction, sustainable development, and life cycle assessment (LCA). The results show that the combination of AI and BIM helps to make optimal decisions on materials, cost, energy, construction scheduling, and monitoring and promotes the development of sustainable buildings in both technical and human aspects so to achieve Sustainable Development Goals 7 (ensuring access to affordable, reliable, and sustainable modern energy for all), 9 (building resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industries, and foster innovation), 11 (building inclusive, safe, risk-resilient, and sustainable cities and human settlements), and 12 (ensuring sustainable consumption and production patterns).

However, informal housing being used as temporary housing by low-income families (especially in megacities) has resulted in informal settlements that are usually densely populated, dilapidated, and disorganized. Identifying targets based on deep learning and single very high-resolution images remains a challenging task. Here, we used multi-source geographic information data and machine-learning methods to identify and compare the distribution of densely populated‒informal settlements (DPISs) and measured population ratios within the urban areas of three Chinese first-tier cities: Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou. Our results indicate that DPISs occupy 1.98%, 0.67%, and 3.95% of the total area in these study regions, with population densities of 42,800 people/km2, 7,100 people/km2, and 20,800 people/km2, respectively. Further, significant variability existed in the distribution of DPISs, population ratios, and composition of the study areas. DPISs reflected the rapid urbanization process in China and the planning of the city, which can be used as an indicator of sustainable urban development in China.","",https://doi.org/10.1080/15481603.2023.2249748,"",,

These impacts can be comprehended by estimating land surface temperature (LST), as it is vital for evaluating urban climate, particularly to explain the intensity of urban heat islands and to define the health and welfare of the planet as well as the living beings. Urbanization-driven landscape changes severely disrupt comfortable living in almost every city, necessitating monitoring and modelling historical, current, and likely future LSTs. This research article proposes two forecasting techniques: Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models. These models have been widely accepted for the efficient prediction of climatic parameters, including LST, over an urban area. The landscape, elevation, and LST trend served as input to the models for an accurate prediction of LST. The analysis was performed over the Kolkata Metropolitan Area (KMA) with an additional 10 km buffer to understand urban growth and its effect on the LST of the entire region. The two developed models (MLR and ANN) effectively anticipated the LST over the KMA region. A continual increment in the surface temperatures ranging from 1 °C to 4 °C, over existing and likely-predicted urban areas was comprehended. It was anticipated that the regions near the urban areas will also experience severe discomfort and heat waves without proper mitigation measures.

This study addresses this gap by examining the planning context of Busan Metropolitan City (BMC) and analyzing the paradoxical objectives within the city’s 2040 Master Plan and the subordinate 2030 Busan Master Plan for Parks and Greenbelts. Although the plans advocate for increased green areas to enhance urban sustainability and social wellbeing, they simultaneously support policies that may lead to a reduction in these areas due to urban development. Using the CA-ANN model in the MOLUSCE plugin, a deep learning-based LULC change analysis, we forecast further urban expansion and continued shrinkage of natural green areas. During 1980–2010, Busan Metropolitan City (BMC) underwent high-speed urban expansion, wherein the urbanized areas almost doubled and agricultural lands and green areas, including forests and grassland, reduced considerably. Forecasts for the years 2010–2040 show continued further expansion of urban areas at the expense of areas for agriculture and green areas, including forest and grasslands. Given the master plans, these highlight a critical tension between urban growth and sustainability. Despite the push for more green spaces, the replacement of natural landscapes with artificial parks and green areas may threaten long-term sustainability. In view of these apparently conflicting goals, the urban planning framework for BMC would have to take up increasingly stronger conservation policies and adaptive planning practices that consider environmental preservation on a par with economic development in the light of the planning context and trajectory of urbanization.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/f15101681,"",,

We used cellular automata to model and simulate urban wetland changes in Bogota, Colombia. The study applied the coupled Markov-Future Land Use Simulation (FLUS) model to simulate and analyze land use/land cover (LULC) change over 20 years. First, we used an orthomosaic (1998) and two WorldView-2 satellite images (2004 and 2010), to detect land cover changes.

A comprehensive exploration into the influence of artificial intelligence on urban pollution emissions has emerged as a pivotal current concern. This study meticulously curated panel data encompassing 279 cities in China from 2005 to 2020, facilitating a quantitative analysis of the effects and underlying mechanisms of artificial intelligence on urban pollution emissions. The findings affirm that the progression of artificial intelligence has effectively curbed urban pollution emissions, assuming the role of a significant ""speed bump"". Rigorous robustness testing corroborated this conclusion. Mechanism testing unveiled that the evolution of artificial intelligence mitigates pollution by enhancing production efficiency, minimizing energy consumption, fostering innovation in green technologies, and optimizing industrial transformation and upgrades. Heterogeneity analysis underscored substantial variances in the impact of artificial intelligence on urban pollution emissions, influenced by pollutant types, regional disparities, and urban scale differentials. Further scrutiny exposed that while the application of artificial intelligence technology does not entirely mitigate the ""local neighbor"" effect, it does ameliorate the ""boundary effect"", subsequently reducing pollution emission intensity in cities straddling provincial administrative boundaries.","",https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4603505,"",,

Besides the existing rainfall measurement systems, citizen science can offer unconventional methods to provide complementary rainfall data for enhancing spatial and temporal data coverage. This demand for accurate rainfall data is particularly crucial in the context of smart city innovations, where real-time weather information is essential for effective urban planning, flood management, and environmental sustainability. Therefore, this study provides proof-of-concept for a novel method of estimating rainfall intensity using its recorded audio in an urban area, which can be incorporated into a smart city as part of its real-time weather forecasting system. This study proposes a convolutional neural network (CNN) inversion model for acoustic rainfall intensity estimation. The developed CNN rainfall sensing model showed a significant improvement in performance over the traditional approach, which relies on the loudness feature as an input, especially for simulating rainfall intensities above 60 mm/h. Also, a CNN-based denoising framework was developed to attenuate unwanted noises in rainfall recordings, which achieved up to 98% accuracy on the validation and testing datasets. This study and its promising results are a step towards developing an acoustic rainfall sensing tool for citizen-science applications in smart cities.

In Iran, particularly in Tehran, recurring flood events underscore the urgent need for robust urban resilience strategies. This paper explores flood resilience models to identify the most effective approach for District 6 in Tehran. Through an extensive literature review, various resilience models were analyzed, with the Climate Disaster Resilience Index (CDRI) emerging as the most suitable model for this district due to its comprehensive resilience dimensions: Physical, Social, Economic, Organizational, and Natural Health resilience. Although the CDRI model provides a structured approach to resilience measurement, it remains a static model focused on spatial characteristics and lacks temporal adaptability. An extensive literature review enhances the CDRI model by integrating data from 2013 to 2022 in three-year intervals and applying machine learning techniques to predict resilience dimensions for 2025. This integration enables a dynamic resilience model that can accommodate temporal changes, providing a more adaptable and data driven foundation for urban flood resilience planning. By employing artificial intelligence to reflect evolving urban conditions, this model offers valuable insights for policymakers and urban planners to enhance flood resilience in Tehrans critical District 6.","",https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2412.06205,"",,

At the community level, fostering quality through a socially sustainable perspective (SSP) is a pivotal strategy for people-oriented urban regeneration. Nonetheless, explorations of community quality assessments grounded in an SSP have been notably scarce in recent scholarly discourse. This study pioneers a multidimensional quantitative model (MQM) for gauging community quality, leveraging diverse geospatial data sources from the SSP framework. The MQM introduces an evaluative framework with “Patency, Convenience, Comfort, and Safety” as primary indicators, integrating multi-sourced data encompassing the area of interest (AOI), Point of Interest (POI), Weibo check-ins, and Dianping data. The model’s efficacy is demonstrated through a case study in the Gusu district, Suzhou. Furthermore, semantic analysis of the Gusu district’s street view photos validates the MQM results. Our findings reveal the following: (1) AI-based semantic analysis accurately verifies the validity of MQM-generated community quality measurements, establishing its robust applicability with multi-sourced geospatial data; (2) the community quality distribution in Gusu district is notably correlated with the urban fabric, exhibiting lower quality within the ancient town area and higher quality outside it; and (3) communities of varying quality coexist spatially, with high- and low-quality communities overlapping in the same regions. This research pioneers a systematic, holistic methodology for quantitatively measuring community quality, laying the groundwork for informed urban regeneration policies, planning, and place making. The MQM, fortified by multi-sourced geospatial data and AI-based semantic analysis, offers a rigorous foundation for assessing community quality, thereby guiding socially sustainable regeneration initiatives and decision making at the community scale.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/ijgi13050167,"",,

New approaches to measure and assess the sustainability of cities can support the development of actions to improve the different dimensions of sustainability. The research aims to propose an urban sustainability index and a maturity model to evaluate the sustainability of cities and monitor it over time. To achieve this objective, a maturity model was developed based on three different techniques: Data Envelopment Analysis, Artificial Neural Networks, and Analysis of Variance. The proposed index and the maturity model were applied to evaluate a sample of 504 Brazilian cities. The main results observed are: (a) the presence of five distinct levels of city performance (maturity), grouped via machine learning and validated via inferential statistics; (b) no city was considered fully sustainable and only 4.76% of the cities studies are at the highest level of urban sustainability maturity; (c) from a joint application of the three quantitative techniques and specific targets for each indicator could be identified, and the performance of cities classified over time. Based on the results, it is hoped that policy makers will have more objective and standardized tools to collect useful information and be able to reinforce critical strategies or chart new policies towards sustainable urban development. It is also hoped that the joint application of the techniques can shed light on new urban sustainability assessment models.","",https://doi.org/10.1002/sd.3120,"",,
rayyan-210782743,A Historical–Projected Analysis in Land Use/Land Cover in Developing Arid Region Using Spatial Differences and Its Relation to the Climate,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Land resources are under relentless pressure from metropolitan regions, pollution, and climate shifts. The urge to monitor Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) and climate changes based on technology and sustainable management are addressed. This study analyzes the historical land cover maps to calculate growth patterns for the years 1985–2022 and uses Logistic Regression (LR) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to project future dynamics forecasts for the years 2030–2040 in the Amman-Zarqa Basin (AZB). The state of the climate and the extreme indices projections of CMIP5 under RCP8.5 are linked to the corrected historical LULC maps and assessed. Given greater dry covering of large surface runoff, little rainfall, and high evapotranspiration rates, the state of the climate across the AZB notably showed instability in key climatic indices and a major exacerbation of warmth and drier soil in the basin. Both climate change and land use are contributing dynamics, but land-use alterations are much more dramatic changes than climate changes. Since the effects of climate alterations are mostly identifiable through land cover forms, land use practices put the phase that may be influenced by climate change. The results revealed that the daily extremes in 1992 are aligned with the corresponding increase of barren lands and diminished the half area of forest, cultivated, rainfed, and pasture lands in 1995. Rainfed regions were converted to agriculture or shrubland with an accuracy of 0.87, and urban encroachment caused the acreage of woodland, cultivated, rainfed, and grazing fields to decrease by almost half. Predicted land cover maps were created using LR in 2030 (Kappa = 0.99) and 2040 (Kappa = 0.90), in contrast to the ANN approach (Kappa = 0.99 for 2030 and 0.90 for 2040). By combining ANN and LR, decreasing bare soil was anticipated between 325 km2 and 344 km2. As a result, 20% of the total area of the major AZB cities’ urban areas will be doubled. More subjective analysis is required to study and predict drought in the future to improve the resilience of various LULC types.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/su15032821,"",,

Urban waterlogging is seriously spreading in China, resulting in a high level of vulnerability in urban societies and economies. It has been urgent for regional sustainable development to effectively identify and analyze the risk factors behind urban waterlogging. A novel model incorporating satellite image semantic segmentation into extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) is employed for identifying and forecasting the urban waterlogging risk factors. Ground object features of waterlogging points are extracted by the satellite image semantic segmentation, and XGBoost is employed to predict waterlogging points and identify the primary factors affecting urban waterlogging. This paper selects the coastal cities of Haikou, Xiamen, Shanghai, and Qingdao as research areas, and obtains data from social media. According to the comprehensive performance evaluation of the semantic segmentation and XGBoost models, the semantic segmentation model could effectively identify and extract water bodies, roads, and green spaces in satellite images, and the XGBoost model is more accurate and reliable than other common machine learning methods in prediction performance and precision. Among all waterlogging risk factors, elevation is the main factor affecting waterlogging in the research areas. For Shanghai and Qingdao, the secondary factor affecting waterlogging is roads. Water bodies are the secondary factor affecting urban waterlogging in Haikou. For Xiamen, the four indicators other than the elevation are equally significant, which could all be regarded as secondary factors affecting urban waterlogging.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/su15086434,"",,

Massive multi-source and multi-scale data include mobile phone signaling data (500 m × 500 m), aerial images (0.49 m × 0.49 m), night light satellite data (500 m × 500 m), land use data (street-block), and POIs data. Methods of convolutional neural network, guided gradient-weighted class activation mapping, bivariate local indicator of spatial association, Elbow and K-means are jointly applied. It is found that the recovery in central areas was slower than in suburbs, especially in terms of working and night-life activities, showing a donut-shaped spatial pattern. Residential areas with mixed land uses seem more resilient to the pandemic shock. More than 60% of open spaces are highly associated with recovery in areas with high-level pre-pandemic social-economic activities. POIs of sports and recreation are crucial to the recovery in all areas, while POIs of transportation and science/culture are also important to the recovery in many areas.

In this study, with a systematic review of 125 scientific documents and reports, which were extracted and refined from the literature based on the PRISMA flowchart, and their inductive content-coding with MaxQDA software, the researchers initially classified AI applications in building climatically resilient cities to three levels of urban governance, planning, and design, and the considerations into two categories: basic requirements and implementation challenges. The findings indicate that the most crucial applications of AI in the mentioned area at the governance level are service monitoring, infrastructure management, citizens engagement, and resource management. At the planning level, AI can supplement cities' robustness and adaptability by promoting emergency response, environmental protection, and traffic and land use planning. Urban designers can also utilize AI for site analysis, design simulation, and building optimization. The results also demonstrate that despite the multiple applications of AI in the development of climatically resilient cities, planners must consider some ethical and technical concerns, such as privacy, data security, and model calibration. Hence, this chapter, in addition to developing an application framework as the basis for planners to employ AI in decision-making processes to build climatically resilient cities, provides recommendations for solving the cited considerations.","",https://doi.org/10.1201/9781003581246-3,"",,

This research, focusing on Silchar City, a non-attainment city under the National Clean Air Program (NCAP), leverages these advanced technologies to understand the urban microclimate and its implications on the health, resilience, and sustainability of the built environment. The rise in land surface temperature (LST) and changes in land use and land cover (LULC) have been identified as key contributors to thermal dynamics, particularly focusing on the development of urban heat islands (UHIs). The Urban Thermal Field Variance Index (UTFVI) can assess the influence of UHIs, which is considered a parameter for ecological quality assessment. This research examines the interlinkages among urban expansion, LST, and thermal dynamics in Silchar City due to a substantial rise in air temperature, poor air quality, and particulate matter PM2.5. Using Landsat satellite imagery, LULC maps were derived for 2000, 2010, and 2020 by applying a supervised classification approach. LST was calculated by converting thermal band spectral radiance into brightness temperature. We utilized Cellular Automata (CA) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to project potential scenarios up to the year 2040. Over the two-decade period from 2000 to 2020, we observed a 21% expansion in built-up areas, primarily at the expense of vegetation and agricultural lands. This land transformation contributed to increased LST, with over 10% of the area exceeding 25 °C in 2020 compared with just 1% in 2000. The CA model predicts built-up areas will grow by an additional 26% by 2040, causing LST to rise by 4 °C. The UTFVI analysis reveals declining thermal comfort, with the worst affected zone projected to expand by 7 km2. The increase in PM2.5 and aerosol optical depth over the past two decades further indicates deteriorating air quality.

We evaluated the performance of the SCRF model and compared the results of other models, including neural network (BPNN), gradient boosting (GBDT), and random forest (RF) models. The results show that compared with the other models, the improved SCRF model performs best. The coefficient of determination (R2) and root mean square error (RMSE) are 0.83 and 9.87 µg/m3, respectively. Moreover, we discovered that the characteristic variables AOD and air temperature (TEM) data improved the accuracy of the model in Shandong Province.

However, their full potential remains unused due to uncertainties surrounding their positioning, measurement quality, and reliability. This study investigates the potential of machine learning (ML) methods serving as a parallel quality control system, using data from amateur and professional weather stations in Brno, Czech Republic. The research aims to establish a quality control framework for measurement accuracy and assess ML methods for measurement labelling. Utilizing global model data as its main feature, the study examines the effectiveness of ML models in predicting temperature and wind speed, highlighting the challenges and limitations of utilizing such data. Results indicate that while ML models can effectively predict temperature with minimal computational demands, predicting wind speed presents greater complexity due to the higher spatial variability. Hyperparameter tuning does not significantly influence model performance, with changes primarily driven by feature engineering. Despite the improved performance observed in certain models and stations, no model demonstrates superiority in capturing changes not readily apparent in the data. The proposed ensemble approach, coupled with a control ML classification model, offers a potential solution for assessing station quality and enhancing prediction accuracy. However, challenges remain in evaluating individual steps and addressing limitations such as the use of global models and basic feature encoding. Future research aims to apply these methods to larger datasets and automate the evaluation process for scalability and efficiency to enhance monitoring capabilities in urban areas.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/su16135713,"",,

The primary objective of this research was to assess the changes in land use and cover and forecast future trends in Lagos for the sustainable development of urbanization. The study utilized remote sensing and GIS technologies to monitor and identify the land use and cover of Lagos from 2000 to 2020. The CA Markov artificial neural network technique for cellular automata was employed to predict changes in land use and cover from 2020 to 2030. In addition, the post-classification comparison method was used to detect changes in classified classes in land use and cover. The study classified satellite images for 2000, 2010, and 2020 to develop land use and cover maps using ERDAS Imagine. The classification was based on six categories, namely 1) water bodies, 2) built-up, 3) bare land, 4) forest, 5) vegetation, and 6) wetlands. The results showed that: 1) the vegetation cover, wetlands, built-up areas, forests, and bare land have undergone significant changes over the past two decades. Built-up areas, wetlands, and forests have increased by 33.57%, 1.01%, and 21.37%, respectively, while vegetation, bare land, and water have decreased by 21.77%, 5.14%, and 17.13%, respectively. 2) Moreover, during 2020-2030, it is projected that 19.18% of forests and 16% of vegetation will decline, while 5.27% of barren land, 0.82% of wetlands, and 15.83% of water will increase. The urban area will be expanded by 42.44%. 3) The simulated results showed that the correction percentage was 82.43%, and the global kappa value was 0.85.

RFR is proposed as it is able to capture the existing and potential interactions between the LULC intensity and their nonlinear interactions with the change-driving factors. For LULCC forecasting, the driving factors comprised physiographic variables (elevation, slope and aspect) and proximity-neighborhood factors (distances to water bodies, roads and urban areas). In simulating the historical LULC (1986–2019) at 5-year time steps, RFR outperformed ANN-CA and LR-CA models with respective percentage accuracies of 84.9%, 62.1% and 60.7%. Using the RFR model, the predicted LULCCs were determined as vegetation (−8.9%), bare soil (+8.9%), built-up (+2.49%) and cropland (−2.8%), with water bodies exhibiting insignificant change.

Specifically, data-driven AI models can analyze large, interconnected databases to develop joint environmental actions. Air quality plays a pivotal role in both climate action and the development of sustainable cities, but developing countries face challenges due to insufficient monitoring stations and limited access to air quality data sets. This study builds upon the MoreAir project, which established a low-cost air pollution monitoring system and provided the first air quality data set from Morocco. We first exploit and delve into the details of the obtained dataset. Subsequently, we conduct a multi-level comparison of data-driven forecasting models, specifically focusing on short-term forecasting of Particulate Matter concentrations. Four forecasting frameworks are explored, using different combinations of exogenous data and spatio-temporal information. Our findings highlight that Machine Learning models, particularly LightGBM and CatBoost, outperform other models. Overall, our study demonstrates that the inclusion of the spatial dimension along with the diverse exogenous features enhances the models' predictive performance, and provides valuable insights.","",https://doi.org/10.1109/access.2023.3331565,"",,

An excellent fire safety management policy can obtain the basic data of fire safety, analyze the existing problems and potential safety hazards, and provide targeted measures for urban fire safety management. At present, the traditional fire safety management policy has exposed many shortcomings, such as the lack of technical support for firefighting means, inaccurate fire data analysis, etc., which ultimately led to low fire extinguishing efficiency and wasted some human and material resources. In the context of smart cities, big data (BD) and artificial intelligence (AI) have gradually integrated into various fields of urban development. This paper studied the fire safety management policies of smart cities based on BD analysis method. First, it summarized the relationship among BD, AI and smart cities, then analyzed the limitations of traditional urban fire safety management models, and finally proposed new fire safety management methods based on BD, AI and sustainable development. This article analyzed the urban fire protection situation from January to June 2022 in Nanchang, and verified the effectiveness of the method proposed in this article. Research has shown that the new fire safety management policy has reduced the number of fires, improved fire extinguishing efficiency by 9.07%, reduced property damage and casualties, and has a high recognition of the method. This also provides a reference for the next step of BD's application in smart cities.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/abstract&gt;","",https://doi.org/10.3934/mbe.2023758,"",,

The proliferation of bike-sharing systems, characterised by their wide availability and high usage rates, has made cycling in urban areas more accessible and convenient for individuals. While the existence of a relationship between cycling behaviour and the built environment has been established, few studies have specifically examined this connection for weekdays and weekends. With the emergence of new data sources, new methodologies have become available for research into this area. For instance, bike-sharing spatio-temporal datasets have made it possible to precisely measure cycling behaviour over time, while street-view images and deep learning techniques now enable researchers to quantify the built environment from a human perspective. In this study, we used 139,018 cycling trips and 14,947 street-view images to examine the connection between the built environment consisting of urban greenways and cycling behaviour. The results indicated that the greenness and enclosure of the level of greenway were positively correlated with increased cycling on both weekdays and weekends. However, the openness of the greenway appears to have opposing effects on cycling behaviour depending on the day of the week, with high levels of openness potentially promoting cycling on weekends but hindering it on weekdays. Based on the findings of this study, policymakers and planners should focus on the cycling environment and prioritise improving its comfort and safety to promote green transportation and bicycle-friendly cities.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/land12030619,"",,

In this study, both the Driving Force-Pressure-State-Impact-Response (DPSIR) framework and the BP neural network were innovatively adopted to construct a comprehensive urban resilience evaluation model. Prefecture-level cities in Hubei Province were examined for empirical analysis. The results showed that: (1) Urban resilience is a dynamic process of change. The resilience level of cities in Hubei Province was influenced primarily by two major factors: driving force and response. (2) The urban resilience of cities in Hubei Province had been improving steadily from 2015 to 2021, but there was a spatial negative correlation among them. Owing to uneven development within Hubei Province, it can be apparently seen that Wuhan, the provincial capital, holds a dominant position. (3) Resource and environmental pressure has become the main obstacle to the construction of resilient cities in Wuhan. The primary limiting factors for other cities are the degree of socioeconomic growth and the capacity of the government to handle affairs. This study not only enriched the theory and methods of urban resilience evaluation, but also had important reference value for the government to formulate effective urban sustainable development strategies.","",https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-4978441/v1,"",,
rayyan-210782841,A spatial hierarchical learning module based cellular automata model for simulating urban expansion: case studies of three Chinese urban areas,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Understanding the spatio-temporal evolution of urban expansion is essential for urban planning and sustainable development. Recently, cellular automata (CA)-based models have emerged as highly effective and widely utilized approaches for simulating urban expansion. However, they suffered from complex structural information inherent in neighborhood effects, including spatio-temporal dimension disjunction and neighborhood sensitivity. To address these issues, herein, we propose a spatial hierarchical learning module based cellular automata model (SH-CA). Specifically, to tackle the spatio-temporal dimension disjunction, we take spatial dependence and historical expansion trends into consideration. We redefine the neighborhood structure and introduce lightweight convolutional neural networks to capture the complex spatio-temporal interaction in neighborhood effects. For the neighborhood sensitivity, we develop a gate filter to aggregate multiscale neighborhood effects for ensuring the synthesis of diverse neighborhood effects disparities. The proposed SH-CA model was implemented to simulate urban expansion in three distinct main urban areas of Beijing, Guangzhou, and Chengdu in China during 2010–2015. The results showed that the proposed SH-CA greatly improves the figure of merit and simulates the most real land-use patterns compared with other four sophisticated CA models. Moreover, the hierarchical learning module effectively modeled spatio-temporal interaction in neighborhood effects, mitigated neighborhood sensitivity, and showed a strong scalability to existing popular CA-based models.","",https://doi.org/10.1080/15481603.2023.2290352,"",,

The research methodology explores the relevance of art and design projects using recycled or waste materials in landscape park architecture for sustainability, helping to preserve natural resources and protect the environment. Additionally, designing a landscape park in Al-Ahsa Governorate using recycled waste materials will educate society about sustainability via artistic creativity. The applied side, designing a group of artworks, was completed using computer graphic programs and AI systems to improve the visual landscape’s architectural aesthetics through sculpture parks, public sets, etc. The result provides evidence that parks in Al-Ahsa lack artwork, color, and the application of recycled materials in landscape facilities which make a negative contribution to the quality of life of society. Using recycled and waste materials in artwork will contribute to a healthy ecological system and preserve natural resources.

Measuring and understanding urban land surface temperatures (LST) and their influencing factors is important in addressing global climate change and enhancing the well-being of residents. However, due to limitations in data precision and analytical methods, existing studies often overlook the microscale examination closely related to residents’ daily lives, and lack a deep exploration of the spatial heterogeneity of the influencing factors. This leads to these results being ineffective in guiding the planning and construction of cities. Taking Shenzhen as a case study, our study investigates the effects of various microscale build environment characteristics of LST using street view images and machine learning. A convolutional neural network model adopting the SegNet architecture is used to perform semantic segmentation on street view images, extracting features of the microscale urban-built environment. The LST is inverted through the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. By using Multiscale Geographically Weighted Regression (MGWR) models, our study reveals the comprehensive impact of the urban-built environment on LST and its significant spatial heterogeneity. The findings indicate that the proportions of sky, roads, and buildings are positively correlated with LST, while trees have a significant cooling effect. Although earth and water can reduce LST, their overall contribution is minimal due to limitations in their area and distribution patterns. This study not only reveals the key factors affecting urban LST at the microscale but also emphasizes the necessity of considering the spatial heterogeneity of these factors’ impacts. This suggests the need for targeted strategies for different areas to effectively improve the urban thermal environment and achieve sustainable urban development.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/atmos15050549,"",,

Therefore, creating new technology to manage water resources is crucial. To create a sustainable urban and ecological environment, a water level and water quality control system implementing artificial intelligence is presented in this research. The proposed smart monitoring system consists of four sensors (two different liquid level sensors, a turbidity and pH sensor, and a water oxygen sensor), a control module (an MCU, a motor, a pump, and a drain), and a power and communication system (a solar panel, a battery, and a wireless communication module). The system focuses on low-cost Internet of Things (IoT) devices along with low power consumption and high precision. This proposal collects rainfall from the preceding 10 years in the application region as well as the region's meteorological bureau's weekly weather report and uses artificial intelligence to compute the appropriate water level. More importantly, the adoption of dynamic adjustment systems can reserve and modify water resources in the application region more efficiently. Compared to existing technologies, the measurement approach utilized in this study not only achieves cost savings exceeding 60% but also enhances water level measurement accuracy by over 15% through the successful implementation of water level calibration decisions utilizing multiple distinct sensors. Of greater significance, the dynamic adjustment systems proposed in this research offer the potential for conserving water resources by more than 15% in an effective manner.

Timely data are needed to ensure that urban change enhances health, wellbeing and sustainability. We present and evaluate a novel unsupervised deep clustering method to classify and characterise the complex and multidimensional built and natural environments of cities into interpretable clusters using high-resolution satellite images. We applied our approach to a high-resolution (0.3 m/pixel) satellite image of Accra, Ghana, one of the fastest growing cities in sub-Saharan Africa, and contextualised the results with demographic and environmental data that were not used for clustering. We show that clusters obtained solely from images capture distinct interpretable phenotypes of the urban natural (vegetation and water) and built (building count, size, density, and orientation; length and arrangement of roads) environment, and population, either as a unique defining characteristic (e.g., bodies of water or dense vegetation) or in combination (e.g., buildings surrounded by vegetation or sparsely populated areas intermixed with roads). Clusters that were based on a single defining characteristic were robust to the spatial scale of analysis and the choice of cluster number, whereas those based on a combination of characteristics changed based on scale and number of clusters. The results demonstrate that satellite data and unsupervised deep learning provide a cost-effective, interpretable and scalable approach for real-time tracking of sustainable urban development, especially where traditional environmental and demographic data are limited and infrequent.","",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.164794,"",,

However, it remains unclear how to quantify the constraining effect of UGBs on urban sprawl and the degree of fragmentation after UGBs constrain urban sprawl. Here, we proposed a UGBs extraction method to explore the spatial evolution of UGBs in the rapidly expanding megacity Beijing from 2000 to 2020. We also quantitatively investigated the role of UGBs in constraining urban sprawl and measured the degree of fragmentation of the UGBs after constraining urban sprawl with the help of the constraint assessment index, the Urban Annual Ring model, and the landscape pattern index. Results showed that: (1) Beijing's UGBs area showed a ""V""-shaped trend of first decreasing and then increasing from 2000 to 2020, decreasing from 332.61 km2 in 2000 to 303.41 km2 in 2015, and then increasing to 369.42 km2 in 2020, which is equivalent to about 54 Beijing Olympic Forest Parks.

A Comparison Analysis for Spatio-temporal Mapping of Mesoscale Urban Air Temperature",,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract Fine-resolution spatio-temporal maps of near-surface urban air temperature ( T a ) provide crucial data inputs for sustainable urban decision-making, personal heat exposure, and climate-relevant epidemiological studies. The recent availability of IoT weather station data allows for high-resolution urban T a mapping using approaches such as interpolation techniques or machine learning (ML). This study is aimed at executing these approaches and traditional numerical modeling within a practical and operational framework and evaluate their practicality and efficiency in cases where data availability, computational constraints, or specialized expertise pose challenges. We employ Netatmo crowd-sourced weather station data and three geospatial mapping approaches: (1) Ordinary Kriging, (2) statistical ML model (using predictors primarily derived from Earth Observation Data), and (3) weather research and forecasting model (WRF) to predict/map daily T a at nearly 1-km spatial resolution in Warsaw (Poland) for June–September and compare the predictions against observations from 5 meteorological reference stations. The results reveal that ML can serve as a viable alternative approach to traditional kriging and numerical simulation, characterized by reduced complexity and higher computational speeds within the domain of urban meteorological studies (overall RMSE = 1.06 °C and R 2 = 0.94, compared to ground-based meteorological stations). The results have implications for identifying the urban regions vulnerable to overheating and evidence-based urban management in response to climate change. Due to the open-sourced nature of the applied predictors and input parsimony, the ML method can be easily replicated for other EU cities.","",https://doi.org/10.1007/s10666-023-09943-9,"",,
rayyan-210782883,A comparative analysis of surface and canopy layer urban heat island at the micro level using a data-driven approach,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"The Urban Heat Island (UHI) phenomenon, which is defined as the temperature differential between inner cities and surrounding areas, has been extensively studied over the past few years to unravel its mechanism and develop mitigation strategies. Nonetheless, two distinct types of temperature can be used to measure UHI, namely, (1) air temperatures, which refer to air temperatures at the canopy layer (CUHI), and (2) surface temperature, which refers to the temperatures at the surface layer (SUHI). The two types of UHI can have different deriving mechanisms and any effective mitigation strategies should be able to mitigate both concurrently. While efforts have been made to compare these two types of UHI, the studies so far seldom used consistent data. This is because SUHI is mostly based on remote sensing data, whereas CUHI commonly requires field measurements. These data are often not consistent with respect to spatial resolution, frequency, and accuracy. To address this gap, the present research aims to perform a comprehensive comparative analysis of CUHI and SUHI using data collected by a tailor-made mobile data collection unit at a high frequency and resolution at the micro-level (i.e., street-level). Data was collected from a fixed 8 km-long route in the city of Apeldoorn, the Netherlands, for the period of one year. Two different machine learning techniques, i.e., random forest and neural network, were used to study SUHI and CUHI. The results indicated a considerable variability between air and surface temperatures during the data collection campaign. Air temperatures ranged from -0,3 to 35,3°C, while surface temperatures fluctuated over a wider range, from -12,0 to 48,4°C at a micro-level. This variability of temperatures translated into an average of 0,10°C for CUHI, and -0,48°C SUHI. More importantly, however, the results highlighted the importance of investigating simultaneously the two types of UHI. This is because while urban features do not change dramatically in short periods of time, the impact of these same features on the CUHI and SUHI is different, therefore urban-heat resilience strategies planned for one type of UHI alone could have a different impact on the other type.","",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scs.2023.104944,"",,

At the heart of our hypothesis is the integration of earth-bound materials and bioreceptive surfaces through metabolic exchanges that can be directly monitored via bioelectricity using advanced computational models and cooperative governance structures. This innovative approach that links the living world with natural materials and digital computing, aims to foster sustainable urban development that dynamically and meaningfully responds to ecological shifts, thereby enhancing social sustainability and environmental resilience. Founded on an active relationship with Earth Based Materials (EBMs) our work operationalises the foundational link between organic life and inorganic matter, e.g., minerals, to establish a dynamic relationship between building materials, and ecological systems drawing on the foundational metabolisms of microbes. To enable this ambitious synthesis, our work builds upon and diverges from traditional foundations by operationalizing actor-network theory, new materialism, and regenerative design principles through the application of bioelectrical microbes to “living” materials and digital twins. We propose a novel resilience framework that not only advocates for a symbiotic relationship between human habitats and natural ecosystems but also outlines practical pathways for the creation of adaptive, self-organizing built environments that are informed by data collection and metabolic feedback loops. These environments are fundamentally regenerative, dynamic, and environmentally responsive in ways that can be understood and engaged by human engineers and designers, transcending current sustainability and resilience targets through a methodology rooted in interdisciplinary collaboration. We address challenges such as regulatory barriers, lack of standardization, and perceptions of inferiority compared to conventional materials, proposing a new standardization framework adaptable to the unique properties of these materials. Our vision is supported by advanced predictive digital modelling techniques and sensors, including the integration of biofilms that generate action potentials, enabling the development of Digital Twins that respond to metabolic signals to enhance sustainability, biodiversity, and ultimately generate environmentally positive socio-economic outcomes. This paper reviews existing methodologies to establish an overview of state-of-the-art developments and offers a clear, actionable plan and recommendations for the realization of regenerative and resilient systems in urban development. It contributes a unique perspective on sustainable urban development, emphasizing the need for a holistic approach, which integrates the foundational metabolism of microbes, assisted by big biological data and artificial intelligences that act in concert to respect both the environment and the intricate dynamics of living systems.","",https://doi.org/10.3389/fbuil.2024.1385116,"",,

This study investigates remote sensing research on SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities) from 2016 to 2023, highlighting the growing interest in the field. By evaluating a large number of selected articles (6820) using a specialized keyword selection strategy and various filters, a significant increase in publication frequency was observed. Remote Sensing and Sustainability were found to be the most relevant journals. A trend towards research addressing urban ecological quality, changes in land use patterns, and the impact of impervious surfaces was found in domain-specific citations. Semi-niche motor themes encompass deep learning, feature extraction, and semantic segmentation. Simultaneously, remote sensing, machine learning, and change detection serve as foundational motor themes, merging elements of both basic and motor themes. The introduction of new analytical methods (e.g., new indices), together with the use of open data and crowdsourcing, has gained great interest. While there has been a strong focus on land cover, urban expansion, and land surface temperature, the main gaps were identified in regional development, disaster, resilience, natural and cultural heritage, housing, and inclusiveness. The findings show the significance of remote sensing research and its practical applications for shaping urban policy, planning strategies, and sustainable urban development. By extracting research patterns using centrality and density analyses and identifying underexplored areas, valuable insights into relationships, significance, and developmental progress within SDG 11-related remote sensing research were gained and may contribute to future planning and informing policymaking decisions.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/su152216094,"",,

rayyan-210782898,Computer Vision and Machine Learning-Based Predictive Analysis for Urban Agricultural Systems,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Urban agriculture presents unique challenges, particularly in the context of microclimate monitoring, which is increasingly important in food production. This paper explores the application of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to forecast key sensor measurements from thermal images within this context. This research focuses on using thermal images to forecast sensor measurements of relative air humidity, soil moisture, and light intensity, which are integral to plant health and productivity in urban farming environments. The results indicate a higher accuracy in forecasting relative air humidity and soil moisture levels, with Mean Absolute Percentage Errors (MAPEs) within the range of 10–12%. These findings correlate with the strong dependency of these parameters on thermal patterns, which are effectively extracted by the CNNs. In contrast, the forecasting of light intensity proved to be more challenging, yielding lower accuracy. The reduced performance is likely due to the more complex and variable factors that affect light in urban environments. The insights gained from the higher predictive accuracy for relative air humidity and soil moisture may inform targeted interventions for urban farming practices, while the lower accuracy in light intensity forecasting highlights the need for further research into the integration of additional data sources or hybrid modeling approaches. The conclusion suggests that the integration of these technologies can significantly enhance the predictive maintenance of plant health, leading to more sustainable and efficient urban farming practices. However, the study also acknowledges the challenges in implementing these technologies in urban agricultural models.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/fi16020044,"",,

This study examines the spatio-temporal effects of land use and land cover changes on the provision and monetary value of above- and below-ground carbon sequestration and storage during 2011, 2019, and the simulated year 2027 in Noida. The Google Earth Engine-Random Forests (GEE-RF) classifier, the Cellular Automata Artificial Neural Network (CA-ANN) model, and the InVEST-CCS model are some of the software tools applied for the analysis. The findings demonstrate that the above- and below-ground carbon storage for Noida is 23.95 t/ha. Carbon storage in the city increased between 2011 and 2019 by approximately 67%. For the predicted year 2027, a loss in carbon storage is recorded. The simulated land cover for the year 2027 indicates that if the current pattern continues for the next decade, the majority of the land will be transformed into either built-up or barren land. This predicted decline in agriculture and vegetation would further lead to a slump in the potential for terrestrial carbon sequestration.

This intricacy amplifies the impacts of natural disasters such as urban flooding, presenting unprecedented challenges in risk management and disaster responsiveness. To address these challenges, this study defines the concept of urban flood resilience and outlines its practical applications in flood risk management, proposing an integrated resilience governance framework. The framework systematically enhances urban flood management by combining structural flood mitigation methods with advanced technologies, including the Internet of Things (IoT) and non-structural decision-support tools powered by Machine Learning Algorithms (MLAs). This integrated approach aims to improve early flood warning systems, optimize urban infrastructure planning, and reduce flood-related risks. The case study of the Cypress Creek watershed validates the framework’s effectiveness under specific scenarios, achieving reductions of 25% in inundation area, 30% in peak flow, and 20% in total flood volume.

However, uncontrolled urban development in some regions has resulted in urban environmental problems arising from an imbalance between supply and demand. This study aims to develop an integrated model for evaluating and prioritizing the management of hazardous urban sprawl in the Bandung metropolitan region of Indonesia. The novelty of this study lies in its pioneering application of long-term remote sensing data-based and machine learning techniques to formulate an urban sprawl priority index. This index is unique in its consideration of the impacts stemming from human economic activity, environmental degradation, and multi-disaster levels as integral components. The analysis of hazardous urban sprawl across three distinct time periods (1985–1993, 1993–2008, and 2008–2018) revealed that the 1993–2008 period had the highest increase in human economic activity, reaching 172,776 ha. The 1985–1993 period experienced the highest level of environmental degradation in the study area. Meanwhile, the 1993–2008 period showed the highest concentration of multi-hazard locations. The combined model of hazardous urban sprawl, incorporating the three parameters, indicated that the highest priority for intervention was on the outskirts of urban areas, specifically in West Bandung Regency, Cimahi, Bandung Regency, and East Bandung Regency. Regions with high-priority indices require greater attention from the government to mitigate the negative impacts of hazardous urban sprawl. This model, driven by the urban sprawl priority index, is envisioned to regulate urban movement in a more sustainable manner.

This paper systematically looks at the Greater Bay Area (GBA) and the Poyang Lake Region (PLR) in China to examine the spatial processes for insights into cities and urbanization, balancing the environmental and socio‐economic dimensions. A total of 226 805 cells are analyzed to unveil the relationship between sustainability changes in 2015–2019 period and urban form indicators, considering sociodemographic variables, geographical features, and city size as control variables. Two tree‐based machine learning models (Random Forest and XGBoost) are developed. This study provides evidence that a monocentric urban form and a high share of small activity clusters are not good for sustainability. For each urban form indicator, there is a non‐linear relationship with sustainability. The results of the machine learning models reconfirm the sustainability benefits of having a strong second activity cluster comparable to the largest one. When planning cities, some forms of land use buffering are desirable. There is also support for developing relatively large activity nodes and promoting compactness in urban form. Beyond urban form characteristics, the levels of urbanization, economic development, and population are still highly relevant.","",https://doi.org/10.1002/adsu.202300401,"",,

Recent initiatives show that when predictive analysis, AI-driven solutions, and innovative indices are integrated, a substantial percentage of climate-related events can be avoided. These digital tools empower coastal urban communities to construct preemptive barriers, devise effective mitigation strategies, and navigate challenges with resilience. The transformative impact is not just theoretical; it's quantifiable, with numbers indicating that a significant portion of potential crises can be averted through proactive measures informed by predictive analytics. This groundbreaking approach, where digital solutions are seamlessly integrated into anticipatory humanitarian action, transforms coastal urban communities from mere responders to architects of their climate destinies. The narrative, rooted in real-world examples and bolstered by numerical evidence, showcases the tangible benefits of technology. The path forward involves AI, predictive analysis, and innovative indices as indispensable tools in scripting resilience stories. As we explore the depths of climate-induced insecurities across diverse regions, the abstract underscores the pivotal role of AI, coupled with innovative indices like INFORM Climate Change, in guiding coastal urban communities towards a future where climate challenges are met with informed, proactive, and resilient responses. 1https://drmkc.jrc.ec.europa.eu/inform-index/INFORM-Climate-Change","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu24-20281,"",,

To assess disparities in heat vulnerability and its environmental justice implications, we model supply-demand mismatches for the ecosystem service (ES) urban temperature regulation. We integrated remote sensing, health, and socio-demographic data with Artificial Intelligence for Environment and Sustainability (ARIES) and geographical information system tools. We computed composite indicators at the census tract level for urban cooling supply, and vulnerability to heat as a measure of demand. We do so in the context of the mid-size city of Vitoria-Gasteiz, Basque Country (Europe). We mapped relative mismatches after identifying and analysed their relationship with socio-demographic and health factors. Our findings show disparities in heat vulnerability, with increased exposure observed among socio-economically disadvantaged communities, the elderly, and people with health issues. Areas associated with higher income levels show lower ES mismatches, indicating higher temperature regulation supply and reduced heat vulnerability. The results point at the need for nature-based heat mitigation interventions that especially focus on the more socio-economically disadvantaged communities.","",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.171215,"",,

It represents a new concept of advancement and mirrors the increasing aspirations of the populace for an improved standard of living. In this context, the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in promoting sustainable development cannot be overemphasized. This paper explores how AI technologies can drive the transition to a green, low-carbon and circular economy. We have established an index system to measure the development level of the artificial intelligence industry and the high-quality development of the economy, which is relevant to the current state of the artificial intelligence industry and the advancement of the economy. Panel data from 2008 to 2017 has been utilized for this purpose. Global principal component analysis method and entropy value method are employed in the evaluation. Through in-depth analysis of the application of artificial intelligence and environmental protection in various provinces and cities, we clarify that artificial intelligence promotes innovation, saves resources, and is conducive to the development of green economy in the new era.","",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-59968-7,"",,

Especially satellite imagery is a potential data source for studying sustainable urban development. However, a comprehensive dataset in the United States (U.S.) covering multiple cities, multiple years, multiple scales, and multiple indicators for SDG monitoring is lacking. To support the research on SDGs in U.S. cities, we develop a satellite imagery dataset using deep learning models for five SDGs containing 25 sustainable development indicators. The proposed dataset covers the 100 most populated U.S. cities and corresponding Census Block Groups from 2014 to 2023. Specifically, we collect satellite imagery and identify objects with state-of-the-art object detection and semantic segmentation models to observe cities' bird's-eye view. We further gather population, nighttime light, survey, and built environment data to depict SDGs regarding poverty, health, education, inequality, and living environment. We anticipate the dataset to help urban policymakers and researchers to advance SDGs-related studies, especially applying satellite imagery to monitor long-term and multi-scale SDGs in cities.","",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-023-02576-3,"",,
rayyan-210782945,Neural embeddings of urban big data reveal spatial structures in cities,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract Over decades, many cities have been expanded and functionally diversified by population activities, socio-demographics and attributes of the built environment. Urban expansion and development have led to the emergence of spatial structures of cities. Uncovering cities’ spatial structures is critical to understanding various urban phenomena such as segregation, equity of access, and sustainability. In this study, we propose using a neural embedding model—graph neural network (GNN)—that leverages the heterogeneous features of urban areas and their interactions captured by human mobility networks to obtain vector representations of these areas. Using large-scale high-resolution mobility data sets from millions of aggregated and anonymized mobile phone users in 16 metropolitan counties in the United States, we demonstrate that our embeddings encode complex relationships among features related to urban components (such as distribution of facilities) and population attributes and activities. The clustered representations of urban areas show the shared characteristics among urban areas in the same cluster. We show that embeddings generated by a model trained on a different county can capture 50% to 60% of the spatial structure in another county, allowing us to make cross-county comparisons and inferences. The findings reveal complex relationships among urban components in cities. Since the identified multifaceted spatial structures capture the combined effects of various mechanisms, such as segregation, disparate facility distribution, and human mobility, the findings could help identify the limitations of the current city structure to inform planning decisions and policies. Also, the model and findings set the stage for a variety of research in urban planning, engineering and social science through an integrated understanding of how the complex interactions between urban components and population activities and attributes shape the spatial structures in cities.","",https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-024-02917-6,"",,

Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 11 explains Sustainable Cities and Communities' concern for society. Rapid urbanisation and accommodating the masses, which started shifting from rural to urban society, brought the construction of cities in full swing. This study reviewed the publication and citation trends, sources, trending topics, thematic evolution and thematic map (niche, motor, basic and emerging or declining themes) through metadata extracted from the Scopus database using the Biblioshiny (R-tool) version 4.2.3 open-access software tool. After applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria, only 537 metadata appeared sufficient for the final analysis. This research answered various research questions, an eye-opening lesson in the present scenario, where every country is marching towards achieving the SDG 2030 agenda. Major publications appeared after the launch of the SDG 2030 agenda, i.e., in 2015. Citations also increased after 2016 and reached their peak in 2021 with 1808 citations. Sustainable development goals and sustainability appeared as the most trending topics, whereas, recently, some topics have also emerged which can play a significant role in achieving the SDG 2030 agenda. Various themes such as sustainable development goals, remote sensing, machine learning and Ethiopia have emerged recently that need to be focused on by future researchers to understand this growing concern better, along with the policy development and strict practice approach. More focus is required on the emerging themes, which can be helpful to progress towards SDG 11. More research, and mega-cities with a sustainability approach, can be a milestone in attaining the SDG 11 target.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/engproc2023059125,"",,
rayyan-210782947,Humanizing Smart Cities: A Preconception to a Better Life for All,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"As cities face the challenge of conceiving new and more competitive and sustainable development models, there has been an emergence of introducing technology to cities to enhance the quality of life it provides to the citizens. The ""Smart City"" was proposed as a new prototype of technology-based urban development. These smart cities witness the emergence of the metaverse and platform societies, machine learning and artificial intelligence (ML/AI), big data, the Internet of Things (IoT) systems, and many other innovative and advanced technologies. However, the idea of the Smart City has developed in such a form that cities have started to encounter the risks of losing social inclusiveness and connection with the human dimension. This research tries to tackle one of the main challenges of urbanism, which is shifting smart city development to be more humanized and people-centered. It also maps the broader approaches and perspectives while reviewing smart cities and addressing their challenges, contributing to the reconceptualization of the Smart City notion. This research also aims to introduce an integrated conceptual framework shifting the experience of smart cities through humanizing the technology to be more human-compatible smart cities. This study tends to help the decision-makers and urban planners build upon the outcome of this research through further exploration of implementation processes toward humanizing future smart cities.","",https://doi.org/10.1109/smartcities4.056956.2023.10525807,"",,
rayyan-210782948,Urban-Rural Geographies of Political Violence in North and West Africa,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"ABSTRACTThis paper assesses the relationship between population density and political violence within North and West Africa. We find that while most violence currently occurs in rural areas, it also exhibits a classic distance-decay effect, commonly occurring near urbanized places. Regional differences are evident as Jihadist-led violence is increasingly rural in West Africa while urban violence was more common in North Africa. Important difference in states with major conflict are also present, exemplified by urbanized violence in Nigeria and rural violence in Mali. Our findings therefore provide mixed evidence for the typical “urbanization of conflict” discourse in the literature.KEYWORDS: citiesconflictNorth and West Africapolitical violenceurbanization Disclosure statementNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s).DisclaimerThe views expressed in this manuscript are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the official policy or position of the United States Air Force Academy, the Air Force, the Department of Defense, or the U.S. Government.Notes1.

The smart city and AI perspective has gained significant attention in urban policy circles, yet many initiatives have faced challenges due to narrow, technology-centric approaches. In response, this paper advocates for a “green AI” approach that prioritises sustainability and equity alongside efficiency in urban development. Through a comprehensive analysis of AI and smart city literature, practices, trends, and applications, this review identifies critical research gaps, stressing the need for AI systems that promote sustainability, efficiency, and fairness in urban contexts. In light of pressing issues like climate change, overpopulation, and resource depletion, the urgency of AI-driven urban solutions is evident. The article examines Smart Cities in Spain and compares them to conventional cities, offering insights into strategic technological measures across areas such as economics, sustainability, transportation, governance, population management, and quality of life. It underscores AI’s potential to transform traditional cities into smart, sustainable urban hubs, contributing to the broader discourse on AI’s role in shaping the cities of tomorrow.","",https://doi.org/10.1051/e3sconf/202454008014,"",,
rayyan-210782950,Designing More-than-Human Smart Cities,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract Climate change, rapid urbanisation, pandemics, as well as innovations in technologies such as blockchain, artificial intelligence (AI), and the Internet of Things (IoT) are all impacting urban space. One response to such changes has been to make cities ecologically sustainable and ‘smart’. From real-time bus information, autonomous electric vehicles, smart parking, and smart street lighting, such initiatives are often presented as a social and environmental good. Critics, however, increasingly argue that technologically driven, and efficiency-led approaches to sustainability in the smart city are too simplistic and leave little room for participation and citizen agency despite government efforts to integrate innovative technologies in more equitable ways. This has prompted a growing awareness that a human-centred notion of cities, in which urban space is designed for, and inhabited by, humans only, is no longer tenable. Within the age of the Anthropocene, increasing numbers of scholars and practitioners are acknowledging the entanglements between human and non-human others (including plants, animals, insects, as well as soil, water, and sensors and their data) in urban life. In Designing More-than-Human Smart Cities, renowned researchers and practitioners from urban planning, architecture, environmental humanities, geography, design, arts, and computing critically explore smart cities beyond a human-centred approach. They respond to the complex interrelations between human and non-human others in urban space. Through theory, policy, and practice (past and present), as well as thinking speculatively about how smart cities may evolve in the future, the book makes a timely contribution to lively, contemporary scientific and political debates on what it means to design genuinely sustainable smart cities.","",https://doi.org/10.1093/9780191980060.001.0001,"",,

Using a combination of several measurement models such as the BCG (Boston Consulting Group) matrix, ESDA (Exploratory Spatial Data Analysis), MLR (Machine Learning Regression), GWR (Geographically Weighted Regression), and GeoDetector, this paper presents an empirical study on the changes in Urban Park Green Areas (UPGAs) in the Grand Canal of China. By quantitatively measuring the spatio–temporal evolution patterns of UPGAs, this study reveals the driving mechanisms behind them and proposes policy recommendations for planning and management based on performance evaluation. The spatio–temporal evolution of UPGAs and their performance in China’s Grand Canal are characterized by significant spatial heterogeneity and correlation, with diversified development patterns such as HH (High-scale–High-growth), HL (High-scale–Low-growth), LH (Low-scale–High-growth), and LL (Low-scale–Low-growth) emerging. The evolution performance is dominated by positive oversupply and positive equilibrium, where undersupply coexists with oversupply. Therefore, this paper recommends the implementation of a zoning strategy in the future spatial planning of ecological green areas, urban parks, and green infrastructure. It is also recommended to design differentiated construction strategies and management policies for each zoning area, while promoting inter-city mutual cooperation in the joint preparation and implementation of integrated symbiosis planning. Furthermore, the spatio–temporal evolution of the UPGAs in the Grand Canal of China is influenced by many factors with very complex dynamic mechanisms, and there are significant differences in the nature, intensity, spatial effects, and interaction effects between different factors. Therefore, in the future management of ecological green areas, urban parks, and green infrastructure, it is necessary to interconnect policies to enhance their synergies in population, aging, industry and economy, and ecological civilization to maximize the policy performance.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/land13010042,"",,

In fact, there hasn't been much focus on the spatial patterns of urbanization and how they affect the environment and agricultural resources, especially in Oman. It may be possible to better understand the connection between spatial growth patterns and its effects on agricultural production by predicting urban growth in Sohar City. This study aims to analyze spatiotemporal dynamics of land use/land cover (LULC) for the last six years (2017–2022) and its impacts especially on the reduction of agricultural land. The spatiotemporal data was obtained from Sentinel-2 with a cell size of 10 meters which was then cropped using the vector boundaries of Sohar city. Part of the data was labelled manually which was used to train supervised machine learning technique for classifying the data into different land covers such as water bodies, trees, crops, etc. Accuracy assessment was carried out by com-paring the automatic classification results with ground truth and an accuracy of 93.4% was obtained. It has been found that built up area is increasing rapidly while hugely affecting the arable land. It's also interesting to see that during the COVID19 pandemic, this urban growth was stopped as evident from the satellite data. The results of this study could address the dangers and declines of urban sustainability for Sohar city, as well as provide geographical guidelines for observing future changes in LULC dynamics. The national strategy for future urban development in Oman also benefits from identifying regions of bare soil and vegetation that are amenable to urbanization.","",https://doi.org/10.1109/acit58888.2023.10453845,"",,

City logistics aim at balancing the economic growth and the environmental sustainability of cities. City logistics have three goals: mobility, sustainability, and liveability. We face difficult and complicated issues, such as higher logistics costs, traffic congestion, air pollution, noise, crashes, and higher energy consumption associated with urban freight transport. To solve these problems, emerging technologies including ITS (Intelligent Transport Systems), ICT (Information and Communication Technology), IoT (Internet of Things), big data, AI (Artificial Intelligence), and robots are useful. Collaboration and coordination among stakeholders who are involved in city logistics are essential to successfully implement schemes to improve sustainability. UFT operations are carried out by private logistics companies but public–private partnerships are needed to totally optimise urban freight transport systems. Understanding stakeholder behaviour is important for modeling city logistics.","",https://doi.org/10.4337/9781800370173.00016,"",,

The advancement of deep neural networks has significantly improved forecasting performance. However, a notable challenge lies in the ability of these models to generalize well to out-of-distribution (OOD) time series data. The inherent spatial heterogeneity and domain shifts across urban environments create hurdles that prevent models from adapting and performing effectively in new urban environments. To tackle this problem, we propose a solution to derive invariant representations for more robust predictions under different urban environments instead of relying on spurious correlation across urban environments for better generalizability. Through extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world data, we demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms traditional time series forecasting models when tackling domain shifts in changing urban environments. The effectiveness and robustness of our method can be extended to diverse fields including climate modeling, urban planning, and smart city resource management.","",https://doi.org/10.1145/3589335.3651897,"",,

Monitoring changes in LULC using geospatial techniques can help to identify areas at risk for indefensible land use, low-grade environment, and especially for sustainable urban planning. This study aims to analyze the changing pattern, dynamics, and alteration of LULC using Google Earth Engine (GEE) and Machine Learning Applications for the years 1991, 2001, 2011, and 2022 in the Varanasi City Development Region (VCDR). The LULC classification was divided into seven classes using random forest classification, and Landsat-5(TM) and 9(OLI-2) satellite data were used. Saga GIS has been utilized for the detection of LULC change during the 1991-2022 period. For validation of classification results, accuracy assessment was estimated using error matrices and through user, producer, and overall accuracy estimation. The Kappa statistics were applied for the reliability of the accuracy assessment result. As a result, the built-up area increased by 507.8 percent, and other classes like agricultural, barren, fallow land, and vegetation cover rapidly declined and altered into concrete areas over the period. Water bodies and river sand classes have been slightly converted into different classes. The finding explains that 114.8 km2 of fertile agricultural land, 14.81 km2 barren land, and 12.93 km2 of vegetation cover transformed into impervious surface, which is unsustainable and causes various problems like food scarcity, environmental degradation, and low quality of urban life.

In this paper, we propose a novel methodological framework that combines deep learning and eye-tracking to investigate the relationships between landscape elements, features, visual focus and public ecosystem aesthetic perceptions of UGSs. Our Public Ecosystem Aesthetic Perceptions (PEAP) model emphasises interactions between ecosystem quality and landscape aesthetic quality. To validate the model, we conducted a study in Shanghai, China, where we selected 54 representative UGSs for photography, perception surveys, and image processing. The results demonstrated that visual focus acts as a mediator between landscape stimuli (landscape elements and features) and perceptions of ecosystem aesthetics. Notably, we found that natural elements elicited significantly stronger visual focus than artificial elements.

Furthermore, we examined the spatial and temporal variations and evolution of urban ecological resilience through measures such as kernel density estimation, Theil index, and the center of gravity standard deviation ellipse. We employ obstacle degree and back-propagation (BP) neural network models to identify the primary barriers and conduct dynamic simulations. Our findings revealed that, from an evolutionary resilience perspective, urban ecological resilience is an inherent characteristic of urban ecosystems. It consistently possesses the dynamic ability to defend against disturbances, respond promptly when interference occurs, and continually learn and innovate, regardless of the urban ecology's state of disturbance. Urban ecological resilience in Guangdong Province has steadily improved with minimal fluctuations, establishing a trend characterized by low concentration and high convergence. Regarding barrier factors, the disposal rate of domestic waste, number of college students per 10,000 people, number of R&D personnel per 10,000 labor force, and per capita park green space area are the primary constraints on urban ecological resilience in Guangdong Province. Dynamic simulations from 2022 to 2030 suggest that urban resilience will experience gradual development with a decreasing overall resilience level. Areas with lower and median resilience values will predominate, while the number of cities with higher resilience levels will see a reduction.

However, the currently accessible GDP gridded datasets are limited in number and resolution. Furthermore, high-resolution GDP mapping remains a challenge due to the complex sectoral structure of GDP, which encompasses agriculture, industry, and services. Meanwhile, multi-source data with high spatial resolution can effectively reflect the level of regional economic development. Therefore, we propose a multi-scale fusion residual network (Res-FuseNet) designed to estimate the GDP grid density by integrating remote sensing and POI data. Specifically, Res-FuseNet extracts multi-scale features of remote sensing and POI data relevant to different sectors. It constructs a joint representation of multi-source data through a fusion mechanism and accurately estimates GDP grid density for three sectors using residual connections. Subsequently, the high-resolution GDP grid data are obtained by correcting and overlaying grid density for each sector using county-level statistical GDP data. The 100-meter gridded GDP map of the urban agglomeration in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River in 2020 was successfully generated using this method. The experimental results confirm that Res-FuseNet outperforms machine learning models and baseline model significantly in training across different sectors and at the town-level. The R2 values for the three sectors are 0.69, 0.91, and 0.99, respectively, while the town-level evaluation results also exhibit high accuracy (R2=0.75).

However, decision-making often favours specific NBS designs, leading to uneven benefits distribution. Whereas human-centric NBS design relies on convenience, financial sustainability, historical aspects, and amenity increase through NBS technical solutions, flora- and fauna-centric (or eco-centric) design targets spatial connectedness of blue-green spaces, increase in species richness, and habitat within urban centres. Both approaches can shape the urban biodiversity landscape, yet; they often clash around planning priorities. Recent advances in AI offer potential for AI-centric urban planning, though its role remains unclear.

rayyan-210783018,A Comprehensive Overview Regarding the Impact of GIS on Property Valuation,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"In the face of pressing global challenges such as climate change, socioeconomic inequalities, and rapid urbanization, ensuring sustainable development in the regions has become essential. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted how vulnerable cities are to unforeseen crises and underscored the urgent need for proactive urban planning strategies capable of navigating dynamic and unpredictable futures. In this context, the use of geographic information systems (GIS) offers researchers and decision makers a distinct advantage in the study of spatial data and enables the comprehensive study of spatial and temporal patterns in various disciplines, including real estate valuation. Central to the integration of modern technology into real estate valuation is the need to mitigate the inherent subjectivity of traditional valuation methods while increasing efficiency through the use of mass appraisal techniques. This study draws on extensive academic literature comprising 103 research articles published between 1993 and January 2024 to shed light on the multifaceted application of GISs in real estate valuation. In particular, three main areas are addressed: (1) hedonic models, (2) artificial intelligence (AI), and mathematical appraisal models. This synthesis emphasizes the interdependence of numerous societal challenges and highlights the need for interdisciplinary collaboration to address them effectively. In addition, this study provides a repertoire of methodologies that underscores the potential of advanced technologies, including artificial intelligence, GISs, and satellite imagery, to improve the subjectivity of traditional valuation approaches and thereby promote greater accuracy and productivity in real estate valuation. By integrating GISs into real estate valuation methodologies, stakeholders can navigate the complexity of urban landscapes with greater precision and promote equitable valuation practices that are conducive to sustainable urban development.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/ijgi13060175,"",,

To communicate the potential of a territory, innovation-design processes are used to develop new products and services and are increasingly able to facilitate territorial mobility. This ensures citizens a high quality of life through technological and sustainable services that are perfectly integrated with each other. Digital is also revolutionizing metropolitan areas, pushing the market toward radical transformations, such as autonomous vehicles used for public passenger transport. Given the many positive impacts of AI in new product development, especially for sustainable urban mobility, this chapter demonstrates, through the development of AI-based innovation in the context of Turin’s smart city, the clear improvement in both the transition toward ecological and responsible progress as well as the well-being of citizens. This chapter analyzes the case of the electric minibus, Olli, and illustrates how it represents an innovative product/service from the technological point of view, and how design can be the engine of innovation.","",https://doi.org/10.4337/9781839106750.00014,"",,
rayyan-210783022,Changes in human settlement environments and their drivers in valley cities located in arid and semi-arid regions: A case study of Lanzhou in Western China,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Development of urban human settlement environments (HSEs) is an integral part of promoting high-quality and sustainable regional development and constructing a beautiful China. The city of Lanzhou, located at the geometric center of China, is the only provincial capital traversed by the Yellow River. Given the constraints posed by the valley topography and the need for economic development, the development of this HSE, which is located within an arid region, poses considerable challenges. Evidently, an understanding of the evolution of HSEs and drivers of changes in them contributes to high-quality, sustainable urban development in arid and semi-arid regions. An analytical model was developed using the parameters of relief degree of land surface, human comfort days, the land cover index, nighttime light index, and precipitation. This model was used in combination with population density and the gross domestic product to analyze the spatial distribution of Lanzhou's HSE and its drivers. The results showed that landscapes in Lanzhou underwent significant changes between 2000 and 2022, with an increase in building-up land (+0.946%), cultivated land (+0.134%), and forest land (+0.018%) and a decrease in grassland (−1.10%). There was significant outward expansion of the main urban zone of Lanzhou and of various county towns, with the increase in building-up land being most prominent. During this period, there were significant changes in the periphery of the core urban area and county towns in Lanzhou, with decreases moving from the urban center (the highest value) to the surrounding areas (Yongdeng County had the lowest value). The correlation between the HSE and population density grew stronger in Anning and Chengguan Districts but became weaker in Xigu and Qilihe Districts. Spatiotemporal variations in the HSE were primarily caused by climate change, followed by human activities, and were also influenced by the valley topography. Overall, the spatial distribution of population density and the HSE in Lanzhou demonstrated good consistency under the influence of economic development and urbanization.","",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rcar.2024.06.001,"",,
rayyan-210783029,Wetland Mapping and Landscape Analysis for Supporting International Wetland Cities: Case Studies in Nanchang City and Wuhan City,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"As the second batch of international wetland cities, Wuhan and Nanchang, both provincial capital cities in China, have abundant wetland resources. An important sign of the achievement of protecting urban wetland areas is the international wetland city designation. Understanding the growth and changes of wetlands in international wetland cities is necessary for wetland protection and management. Thus, it is crucial to conduct proper wetland mapping in these international wetland cities. By studying wetland cities, sustainable planning can be provided to promote the coordinated development of wetlands and cities. In this research, Google Earth Engine and random forest machine learning were used. According to the ""Data-Information-Knowledge-Wisdom"" research framework, we carried out mapping of diverse wetlands in Wuhan and Nanchang with a resolution of 10 m in 2015 and 2020. Then, using the findings of wetland mapping, we examined changes in the wetland landscapes of the two cities. Finally, this study examined changes in international wetland city indicators over this time frame. The research results showed that (1) our wetland mapping results in 2015 and 2020 achieved good accuracy, with overall accuracy over 0.90 and kappa coefficient over 0.85. (2) The total wetland area in both cities increased. Nanchang grew by 91.11 km2, while Wuhan grew by 290.68 km2. Most restored wetland areas were far from urban construction areas. In the two cities, the fragmentation of wetlands decreased, the diversity of wetlands increased, and the growth rate of wetlands was high. (3) Wetland rates rose from 17.79 to 19.07% in Nanchang and from 19.74 to 23.12% in Wuhan, according to mapping results between 2015 and 2020. The wetland protection rate in Nanchang remained unchanged, but the wetland protection rate in Wuhan decreased. Wuhan needs to strengthen the protection of increased wetlands. In addition, the study found that most of the increased areas of wetlands were previously cultivated land. The international wetland mapping framework of this study can be easily implemented in other regions of the world.","",https://doi.org/10.1109/jstars.2023.3302031,"",,

This study aimed to identify suitable sites for eco-friendly and safe building complexes amidst complex geophysical, geoecological, and socio-economic factors, integrating natural hazards assessment and risk management. Employing the Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (Fuzzy-AHP), the study constructed a suitability model incorporating sixteen parameters. Additionally, a Deep Neural Network (DNN) based on eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) conducted sensitivity analyses to assess the parameters’ influence on optimal location decision making. The results reveal slope as the most crucial parameter (22.90%), followed by altitude and land use/land cover (13.24%), emphasizing topography and environmental considerations. Drainage density (11.36%) and rainfall patterns (9.15%) are also significant for flood defense and water management. Only 12.21% of the study area is deemed “highly suitable”, with “no-build zones” designated for safety and environmental protection. DNN-based XAI demonstrates the positive impact of variables like the NDVI and municipal solid waste generation on site selection, informing waste management and ecological preservation strategies.

Nighttime light (NTL) data can capture the lighting signal of ground objects. However, most built-up area extraction is conducted on public limited coarse spatial resolution NTL images. The Sustainable Development Science Satellite-1 (SDGSAT-1) provides 10 m spatial resolution panchromatic NTL images, making it possible to map detailed urban lighting structures. In urban extraction, the boundaries of urban areas are easily confused with background objects due to the similar spectral and textual features. To address this problem, we proposed a multi-task deep learning model, CG-CFPANet, to extract illuminated built-up areas by synthesizing SDGSAT-1 NTL data and optical remote sensing images. In CG-CFPANet, a convolutional feature pyramid attention (CFPA) module for better contextual recognition and a concatenation group (CG) module to merge the two remote sensing images are developed. Our proposed CG-CFPANet achieved 1.3% higher precision in built-up area extraction than ten other recently proposed network structures: UNet, UNet++, PSPNet, DeeplabV3, FCN, ExtremeC3Net, SegNet, BiseNet, Res2-UNet, and CBRNet.

rayyan-210783045,Segmenting Urban Scene Imagery in Real Time Using an Efficient UNet-like Transformer,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Semantic segmentation of high-resolution remote sensing urban images is widely used in many fields, such as environmental protection, urban management, and sustainable development. For many years, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been a prevalent method in the field, but the convolution operations are deficient in modeling global information due to their local nature. In recent years, the Transformer-based methods have demonstrated their advantages in many domains due to the powerful ability to model global information, such as semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, and object detection. Despite the above advantages, Transformer-based architectures tend to incur significant computational costs, limiting the model’s real-time application potential. To address this problem, we propose a U-shaped network with Transformer as the decoder and CNN as the encoder to segment remote sensing urban scene images. For efficient segmentation, we design a window-based, multi-head, focused linear self-attention (WMFSA) mechanism and further propose the global–local information modeling module (GLIM), which can capture both global and local contexts through a dual-branch structure. Experimenting on four challenging datasets, we demonstrate that our model not only achieves a higher segmentation accuracy compared with other methods but also can obtain competitive speeds to enhance the model’s real-time application potential. Specifically, the mIoU of our method is 68.2% and 52.8% on the UAVid and LoveDA datasets, respectively, while the speed is 114 FPS, with a 1024 × 1024 input on a single 3090 GPU.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/app14051986,"",,

Human activity indicators were constructed based on the data of POI points, OSM road network, and residential areas. Machine learning models such as support vector regression machine, extreme gradient boosting regression, polynomial regression, and random forest regression were combined with remote sensing images to construct an urban ecological environment indicator system. These models were used to conduct regression analysis of urban ecological environment indicators and human activity indicators in Chengdu, China. The research shows that the three indicators of human activities all show a trend of increasing in the center and gradually decreasing in the surrounding areas, while the sustainable urban ecological environment indicators show the opposite trend. On the relationship between urban ecological environment and human activities, XGB has the best effect; the correlation between the street vitality index and the urban function mixing index and the sustainable urban ecological environment is stronger, and the correlation between the walkability measure index of the residential area and the sustainable urban ecological environment is even worse.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/su15054340,"",,

However, the spatial pattern and distribution of urban farms and their consequential implications for climate change adaptation have received limited attention in both theory and practice. The study employed a mixed-methods research approach. Geospatial data was collected using the Global Positioning System. The average nearest neighbour (ANN) ratio analysis was done to determine the spatial distribution pattern of urban farms and was supplemented with 12 key informant interviews. The results showed that the rearing of animals—cattle, goats, sheep, and poultry—is clustered across the urban neighbourhood. Also, while keeping animals in open spaces distribution is dispersed, keeping animals in walls roofed with zinc and wooden structures roofed with zinc are clustered within the urban space. Interestingly, the distribution of urban farm sizes portrayed a clustered pattern across space. The results imply that the spatial pattern and distribution of urban farms are influenced by climate change adaptation measures, leading to potential shifts in agricultural practices, land use, and resource allocation within urban areas. Knowledge of the characteristics and distribution of urban farms is pertinent for policymakers and practitioners to focus attention on addressing climate change adaptation strategies and promoting sustainable development.

To conduct our investigation, we utilized the urbanization cube theory, satellite-derived gridded datasets, and the self-organizing map. Our findings show that eastern China has higher levels of integrated transformation and coupling compared to western China.

Cities hold large potential to reduce energy demand and emissions from mobility through encouraging shorter travel distances and sustainable travel modes. In European cities however, personal cars still dominate travel, facilitating continued growth of transport emissions and having negative implications for numerous other dimensions of sustainability. A growing body of research investigates linkages between urban form and mobility, mostly using aggregate data in multiple cities, or disaggregated data for individual cities. Here, we compare urban travel patterns and influences of urban form at spatially disaggregated scale across nineteen cities in four European countries using statistically advanced methods. We enrich travel survey data with metrics describing local urban form. We compare car ownership and travel patterns across cities and use supervised machine learning to explore influences of urban form and other features on mode choice, car ownership, and trip distances. Residential proximity to the city center is the greatest enabler of sustainable urban mobility. Future residential development should be concentrated near to urban centers. Overall city size is important, as occupants of small and medium-sized cities have higher car ownership and use than large cities, motivating increased attention on sustainable mobility transitions outside of large cities.

A growing amount of waste has become a major concern for municipal authorities and local governments due to the limited availability of suitable land. Geospatial techniques, such as Geographic Information Systems (GISs) and remote sensing, combined with machine learning, play a crucial role in identifying suitable sites for urban waste management. These techniques assist planners in making well-informed decisions that strike a balance between environmental preservation and urban expansion by examining spatial data on land use, population density, and environmental concerns. Geospatial tools provide a data-driven basis for policy and urban planning, ensuring effective land use, reducing ecological hazards, and promoting sustainable urban growth for municipalities such as English Bazar and Old Malda. It can also pose serious threats to the environment, public health, and communities. Focusing on the English Bazar and Old Malda Municipalities in India, this paper examines the use of geospatial technologies to identify suitable sites for waste disposal. The research aims to address the complex processes of waste generation, collection, and disposal in urban environments. Using GIS and a Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) approach, the study employs the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) alongside the Random Forest (RF) model and a machine learning (ML) technique to identify potential waste disposal sites within the English Bazar and Old Malda Municipalities in the Malda district. Eight key criteria were considered in the site selection process: land elevation; distances from surface water, roads, railways, and urban areas; groundwater depth; land use and land cover; and distance from sensitive and restricted areas. AHP analysis showed that 8%, 26%, and 27% of the sites were categorized as very highly suitable, moderately suitable, and unsuitable, respectively. Meanwhile, 38%, 17%, and 13% of the areas were classified as unsuitable, moderately suitable, and very highly suitable according to the RF model.

Many of the strategies that have been proposed for this purpose promote the creation of green infrastructures. The Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with chemistry (WRF-Chem) is used to analyze the behavior of the most common pollutants and how they are dispersed as a result of different meteorological conditions. To also consider the impact of including green infrastructures on urban morphology, the BEP/BEM (Building Effect Parameterization/Building Energy Model) multi-layer urban scheme is also included in the system. Using the city of Barcelona as a case study, this paper confirms that the modeling methodology used up to now needs to be reviewed for the design of green cities. Certain limitations of the WRF-Chem+BEP/BEM coupled model when applied in urban resolution are discussed, as well as the reasons for such limitations, being the main contribution of this paper to show that an alternative paradigm such as Machine Learning techniques should be considered to address this challenge.","",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jocs.2024.102289,"",,

rayyan-210783096,Feeding the cities: Urban agriculture for food security and sustainability of urban areas,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract With the increasing migration of people to urban areas, the demand for extra, fresh, and healthy food in cities has escalated manyfold. Further, anthropogenic activities, high rise buildings, and unplanned construction in urban areas are increasing urban heat. Therefore, the objective of this study is to review the salient features and constraints of urban agriculture, in addition to illustrating traditional and modern approaches, and policies used worldwide to promote the urban agriculture (UA). Urban agriculture is a key component of sustainable urban development that plays a pivotal role in combating food security and malnutrition in peri-urban and urban areas by growing different fruits, vegetables, mushrooms, herbs, flowering and ornamental plants in urban dwellings for food and aesthetic purposes. UA often combines with other functions like urban greening, biodiversity, waste recycling, environmental disaster reduction, CO 2 absorption, urban heat island reduction, recreational benefits, contributing to the circular economy and UN sustainable development goals (SDGs). Plants in UA are grown in vacant open spaces, rooftops, balconies and containers, resulting in urban organic harvest by fostering income and health improvement. The concept of UA is being utilized efficiently in many countries. However, there is still a need to promote UA by arranging community gatherings and school students, creating awareness and capacity building through education and training. Growers need to be connected to land and open spaces, enhancing value addition in UA and formulating supportive policies to foster Agri-tourism in urban farms to making it a successful initiative. Recent innovative research ideas and new technological developments such as artificial intelligence (AI), internet of things (IoT), automation and mechanization in UA are opening new avenues for quality food production in urban areas for sustainable cities.","",https://doi.org/10.1079/cabireviews.2024.0053,"",,

Previous studies, due to their lack of direct spatial alignment and attention to a human-scale perspective, struggled to comprehensively measure urban GS exposure. To address this gap, our study introduces a novel GS exposure assessment framework, employing machine learning and street view images. We conducted a large-scale, fine-grained empirical study focused on downtown Shanghai. Our findings indicate a pronounced hierarchical structure in the distribution of GS exposure, which initially increases and subsequently decreases as one moves outward from the city center. Further, from both the micro and macro perspectives, we employed structural equation modeling and Geodetector to investigate the impact of the urban built environment on GS exposure. Our results highlight that maintaining an appropriate level of architectural density, enhancing the combination of sidewalks with GSs, emphasizing the diversity of regional characteristics, and avoiding excessive concentration of functions are effective approaches for increasing urban GS exposure and promoting human wellbeing.

rayyan-210783119,Examining the effect of urbanization on various land cover classes and environmental quality using remote sensing and GIS methods,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract It is vital for public awareness and decision-makers to investigate the impact caused by changes in urban land use and land cover on ecosystem service values (ESVs) in order to promote sustainable urban development, protect the environment, protect public health, and ensure communities’ long-term well-being. Changes in ecosystem services brought on by changes in land use and cover (LULC) are a crucial early indicator and warning sign of ecological shifts. Using remote sensing and GIS tools, this study examined the shifting dynamics of ESVs in the Haridwar district in Uttarakhand state, India. The evaluation of land use land cover (LULC) changes was carried out by analyzing satellite images of the research region from 2001 to 2021. In addition, we examined changes in ecosystem services according to the study area’s LULC classifications. Using a random forest machine learning classifier, satellite images were classified into five categories of land cover: water bodies, forests, built-up areas, agricultural land, and bare land. The findings showed that from 2001 to 2021, forest cover and water bodies fell by 15.35% and 41.50%, respectively, while urban area and agricultural area rose by 69.24% and 12.31%, respectively. Due to increased urbanization and degradation of water bodies and forest areas, ESV fell from 103.19 USD ha −1 year −1 in 2001 to 70.53 USD ha −1 year −1 in 2021. The combination of LULC with the value of ecosystem services may improve our knowledge of several difficulties in an urban ecosystem. As a result, we advocate for the incorporation of LULC and ESVs as a tool that might be useful to urban planners and land managers in the future for sustainable development of natural resources.","",https://doi.org/10.1088/2631-8695/ad5c2c,"",,

Focusing on six diverse cities, the research employed supervised machine learning to classify street networks into gridiron, organic, hybrid, and cul-de-sac patterns with the street-based local area (SLA) as the unit of analysis. Utilising quantitative street metrics and GIS, the study analysed the urban form through the random forest method, which reveals the predictive features of urban patterns and enables a deeper understanding of the spatial structures of cities. The findings showed distinctive spatial structures, such as ring formations and urban cores, indicating stages of urban development and socioeconomic narratives. It also showed that the unit of analysis has a major impact on the identification and study of street patterns. Concluding that machine learning is a critical tool in urban morphology, the research suggests that future studies should expand this framework to include more cities and urban elements.

This study employs deep neural network (DNN) models: multilayer perceptron (MLP), and long short-term memory (LSTM), to analyze the effect of the transportation infrastructure-based accessibility on the prevalence of MLU patterns, based on the following data: infrastructure-based accessibility measures represented by the logsum (or transport supply), MLU patterns at the parcel level, and floor space prices by space type, for the years 2012 and 2015. Furthermore, the proposed methods are applied to the Jiang’an District of the city of Wuhan, China, at the parcel level as the case study. The study results reveal that MLU is predominantly accessible in areas close to the city center, characterized by a high density, and is relatively scarce on the city outskirts. Notably, parcels exhibiting mixed residential–commercial and residential land-use patterns underwent significant changes between 2012 and 2015, particularly in regions with robust accessibility via non-motorized modes and public transit, specifically in the central and southern parts of Jiang’an District. This transition is evident under scenario 3 (walk, bike, bus, subway) and scenario 6 (walk, bus, car) considered in this study. Furthermore, the study observed a substantial expansion in mixed commercial–residential and commercial districts, significantly near the high-transit accessibility area of subway line 1, as demonstrated in scenario 7 (bike, subway, taxi). The results from the MLP models show a mean relative error (MRE) of 4.7–14.08% for the MLU, and the LSTM models show an MRE of 3.74–10.38% for the MLU. More importantly, both the training and forecasting errors of the above models are lower, in most cases, than those reported in the literature. Moreover, these results indicate that the transportation supply or the infrastructure-based accessibility (represented by logsum) significantly influences MLU patterns.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/su152115470,"",,

We studied spatiotemporal trade and shopping patterns in the city of Tabriz using data generated by customer purchase transactions obtained from 5200 stores, shopping, business and service centres. We employed time series transaction data collected from the points of sale in stores, shopping, service and business centres located in different areas of the city. We applied four well known geospatial big data driven approaches including machine learning nearest neighbour, kernel density estimation, space–time pattern mining and spatiotemporal coupling tele-coupling for detecting and mapping of spatial trade hotspot patterns. The results of this study indicated the potential of GIScience methods for the explicit spatial mapping of trade and shopping patterns. The results revealed that the city centre, particularly the Bazaar of Tabriz, acts as the city's heart of trade, and we identify additional major business hotspots. Furthermore, the results allow for studying the impacts of unbalanced urban development in Tabriz, where the wealthy suburbs with high quality of life, such as Valiasr and Elguli, host the major shopping hotspots. The spatial patterns obtained enable local stakeholders, decision makers and authorities to develop strategic plans for urban sustainable development in Tabriz. The geospatial big data approach used can stimulate novel and progressive research. Results of this study demonstrate methodological advancements in GIScience by 'spatializing' individual purchase data and therefor proposing an explicit geospatial big data analysis approach.","",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jag.2024.103764,"",,

In this context, the development of an AI-powered energy forecasting tool is a viable way to addressing the complex difficulties of urban energy management. This research focuses on explaining the technique and critical components of such a tool, which is critical in providing exact projections for energy generation in urban areas. The major focus is on the use of solar and wind energy for hydrogen synthesis. The creation of this AI tool necessitates a careful data processing approach that includes the acquisition and analysis of a full 12-month dataset including all seasons. This information is critical since it serves as the foundation for assuring the accuracy of energy availability projections. It compensates for variations in solar irradiation, which is crucial for solar energy, and wind speed, which is critical for wind energy. The program can offer realistic estimates that account for the intermittent nature of renewable energy sources by including these dynamic characteristics. This enables urban planners to make well-informed judgments about maximizing energy consumption, resulting in a more sustainable and efficient urban energy environment. The synthesis of hydrogen using proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzers is one of the principal uses of the AI-driven instrument. As renewable energy sources such as sun and wind vary, excess energy may be transferred to PEM electrolyzers, where water is electrolyzed to produce hydrogen. The quantity of hydrogen generated by a hybrid solar and wind energy system is expected to be 3.5 kg/day to 21 kg/day. This sustainable hydrogen generation provides a possible method for efficiently storing and using excess renewable energy, hence boosting energy sustainability in urban settings.","",https://doi.org/10.1109/icodt259378.2023.10325817,"",,

The availability of open-access Sentinel-2 data from the Copernicus program presents an opportunity to create a comprehensive global map of human settlements, offering a detailed view of built areas on a large scale. This study estimates large-scale built-up fractions using encoder-decoder deep learning architectures like U-net, Res-U-net, and Attention-U-net in the large and complex urban area of Delhi, India. Openly available datasets like Open Street Map (OSM) and Microsoft building footprint datasets are used to derive built-up fractions at 10×10m resolution cells for over 34,000 km2. Our results show that Attention-U-net with the Huber loss function performs the best in different built-up densities (i.e., urban, semi-urban or rural) with an R2 score of 0.631, while Res-U-net and U-net obtained an R2 score of 0.623 and 0.612, respectively. The investigated networks significantly improve the accuracy over the latest Global Human Settlement Layer product (GHSL-S2), which uses a deep-CNN and reaches an R2 of 0.387 in our case study area.

rayyan-210783163,Role of Satellite Precipitation Products in Real-Time Predictions of Urban Rainfall-Runoff by Using Machine Learning Modelling,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"The accurate prediction of runoff features such as water level and flow is valuable for planning and operation of urban drainage systems (UDS), especially for appropriately acting as flood control mechanisms during extreme rainfall events which are constantly impacted by climate change variables [1]. In addition, cost-effective design, and operation of flood control measures such as smart UDS require highly accurate rainfall predictions across the catchment area, i.e., intensity and duration [2]. Furthermore, sufficient lead time is needed to activate the control mechanisms on the UDS without affecting the accuracy of the predictions. It seems that the emerging use of satellite precipitation products (SPPs) is promising for obtaining predictions with longer lead times [3]. Hence, more exploration of potential runoff predictions by using SPPs is worth investigating to achieve a more accurate and longer lead time.This study employs a type of SPPs i.e., global precipitation measurement-integrated multi-satellite retrieval product (GPM-IMERG) to predict rainfall-runoff duration, peak and volume, as well as changes in flow over the course of the event at 30-minute intervals. In order to train and validate the machine learning model, the data from GPM-IMERG V06 was merged with ground data from the catchment precipitation gauge and flow sensor. The methodology is demonstrated by its application to the rainfall-runoff modelling of a real-world small urban sub-catchment area and its performance is evaluated by comparing it with the runoff predictions from physically based simulation models [4].Results show that while using SPPs solely can provide accurate predictions, significant improvement can be obtained when this data is integrated with ground monitoring data. The model output can be utilised for better design, planning and management of UDS technologies as flood control tools and consequently real-time operation of UDS in urban flooding.[1] Ferrans, P., Torres, M., Temprano, J., S&amp;#225;nchez, J., (2022).

rayyan-210783166,Exploring the non-linear impacts of urban features on land surface temperature using explainable artificial intelligence,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"High land surface temperatures (LST) have emerged as crucial threats to urban ecosystems and sustainable urban development. To better understand and mitigate their impacts, it is essential to analyze the contributing urban features. Against this background, we developed a random forest model enhanced by Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) to analyze the impact features of LST in Beijing, China. By applying the XAI method, our results suggest that the major impact features of LST in Beijing are elevation (44.19%), compactness of impervious surface (17.27%), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (11.12%), proportion of impervious surface area (8.04%), and tree height (3.83%). Compactness of impervious surface exhibited an overall cooling effect, which became weaker at high values. LST increased with building height, and the trend became weaker as building height reached 5 m. The most important features impacting LST in the inner city are the proportion and height of buildings, whereas in the outer city these features are tree height and the compactness of impervious surfaces. The study applies XAI to explain the non-linear interactions between LST and urban features, offering innovative insights to policy-makers to develop sustainable urban planning strategies. Our findings suggest that increasing green spaces and water bodies as well as controlling building density and height can effectively mitigate heat in dense urban areas and enhance cooling effects.","",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.uclim.2024.102045,"",,

The distribution of flood risks is heterogeneous, so it is crucial to allocate emergency resources reasonably. This article develops an analytical framework to evaluate the effect of urban flooding on emergency responses based on social sensing data. Initially, we designed a Weibo search pattern and used natural language processing technologies to get high‐risk flood points. Then, assuming that such high‐risk flood points can disrupt traffic, we assessed urban emergency shelter accessibility after flooding events. Finally, we carried out an evaluation of spatial fairness between population and emergency shelter accessibility through spatial correlation analysis. We analyzed the urban area of Nanjing as a case study, extracting 37 high‐risk flood points from the past 5 years. The results highlight that existing emergency shelters fall short in accommodating the needs of urban residents under disaster conditions. This disparity is notably amplified in high‐risk flood points. By measuring the impact of flooding quantitatively, we expect to promote a more comprehensive management on urban flood risks.","",https://doi.org/10.1111/tgis.13127,"",,
rayyan-210783171,Green Urban Scenarios: A Framework for Digital Twin Representation and Simulation for Urban Forests and Their Impact Analysis,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract Background Trees are a critical part of urban infrastructure. Cities worldwide are pledging afforestation objectives due to net-zero targets; however, their realisation requires a comprehensive framework that combines science, policy, and practice. Methods The paper presents the Green Urban Scenarios (GUS) framework for designing and monitoring green infrastructures. GUS considers weather, maintenance, tree species, diseases, and spatial distributions of trees to forecast their impacts. The framework uses agent-based modelling (ABM) and simulation paradigm to integrate green infrastructure into a city’s ecological, spatial, economic, and social context. ABM enables the creation of digital twins for urban ecosystems at any level of granularity, including individual trees, to accurately predict their future trajectories. Digital representation of trees is created using a combination of datasets such as earth observations from space, street view images, field surveys, and qualitative descriptions of typologies within existing and future projects. Machine learning and statistical models calibrate biomass growth patterns and carbon release schemes. Results The paper examines various green area typologies, simulating several hypothetical scenarios based on Glasgow’s urban forests. It exhibits the emergence of heterogeneity features of the forests due to interactions among trees. The growth trajectory of trees has a non-linear transition phase toward stable growth in its maturity. Reduced maintenance deteriorates the health of trees leading to lower survival rate and increased CO 2 emissions, while the stormwater alleviation capacity may differ among species. Conclusions The paper demonstrates how GUS can facilitate policies and maintenance of urban forests with environmental, social, and economic benefits.","",https://doi.org/10.48044/jauf.2023.029,"",,

Existing empirical evidence highlights the interaction between tourists’ and residents’ perception of urban spaces and the local society and living spaces. This study, focusing on Macau, utilizes the region’s streetscape images to construct a deep learning-based model for quantifying the urban street perception of tourists and local residents. To obtain more refined perceptual evaluation data results, during the training phase of the model, we intentionally categorized tourist activities into natural landscape tours, historical sightseeing, and entertainment area visits, based on the characteristics of the study area. This approach aimed to develop a more refined perception evaluation method based on the classification of urban functional areas and the types of urban users. Further, to improve the streetscape environment and reduce visitor and resident dissatisfaction, we delved into the differences in perception between tourists and residents in various functional urban areas and their relationships with different streetscape elements.

Landsenses ecology proposes the concepts of physical and psychological perceptions to measure the interaction between humans and the urban environment. However, such perceptions and their quantitative relationships with housing rental prices (HRPs) are still not clear. In this study, a novel urban-perception-oriented hedonic price model (UP-HPM) is proposed based on the construction of a multisource geographic database of Beijing’s rental market with rich information on people-oriented perception metrics, neighborhood environment characteristics, and HRPs. Furthermore, we use advanced machine learning (ML) pipelines to measure residents’ multidimensional urban perceptions and investigate their impact on block-level HRPs and their spatial disparities. We also quantify and compare the contribution of different physical and psychological perceptual attributes to HRPs through UP-HPM.

In light of recent advances in knowledge graph theory and application technology, their notable knowledge integration and representation capabilities may offer support for dynamic monitoring and decision-making processes concerning urban rainstorm disaster events. However, conventional models do not adequately capture the spatiotemporal characteristics of these events. To fill this gap, we analyze the essence of urban rainstorm disaster events and divide their evolution into four stages, namely, pregnant, development, continuous, and decline stages. On this basis, a multilevel knowledge representation model is proposed from four layers, which are event, object–state, feature, and relationship layers, by analyzing the components and dynamic characteristics from the mechanism of urban rainstorm disaster events. The proposed model can not only express the comprehensive structure and relationships within urban rainstorm events, but also emphasize the evolution of disaster events through a series of ordered states. Moreover, we test the utility of the constructed knowledge graph through a case study of the Zhengzhou 720 rainstorm. The case study first validates that the selected machine learning models can extract the urban rainstorm disaster event information accurately by comparing them with some mainstream models. Then, it demonstrates that the knowledge graph is practical in the field of disaster knowledge representation, and disaster condition retrieval. Additionally, since the knowledge graph can show the evolution of a disaster event throughout its full life cycle, it can promote the understanding of the mechanisms of urban rainstorm disasters and pave the way for future applications of disaster prevention and reduction.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/w16070942,"",,

Does this bring a question in mind is accelerated growth sustainable? The answer and solution to this is an adaption of the Smart City Concept. A smart city integrates all the available technology with the requirements of city development and builds infrastructure which can improve the quality of life of citizens. Smart cities are designed in a manner to use minimum resources with maximum efficiency in all areas of urban life. It provides smart solutions using smart technologies. Urban needs and technological advancements meet in smart cities. It manages cities more quickly and effectively by using AI, IT technologies, and robotic process automation. Intelligent transportation, intelligent energy, intelligent governance, intelligent security, intelligent healthcare are all central to the idea of smart cities. The emphasis of this essay is on smart transit as a component of smart cities. The movement of people and goods across several geographical boundaries has been significantly aided by the transportation sector. Globally, the majority of smart cities face logistical and transportation issues. Both the fast growing human population and the increase in the number of cars on the road are to blame for this. In order to design and run a sustainable transportation system, technology may be of great assistance. Robotic systems for real-time vehicle data collection, traffic management, and using mobility on demand in trip planning through a single user interface have emerged as cities struggle with traffic congestion. The transportation industry, which faces difficulties including traffic congestion, unanticipated delays, and routing issues that cause businesses to lose money, has successfully used robotic process automation. Robotic process automation provides reliable results and affordable solutions while reducing uncertainty in the decision-making process. It is very helpful in designing and running a successful transit system. Robotic Process Automation (RPA) systems for obtaining real-time data from vehicles, buses, and trucks for traffic management and using mobility on demand in trip planning through a single user interface have emerged as cities struggle with poor management and congestion. By examining different uses of robotic process automation, it is possible to evaluate precise prediction and detection models that are intended to forecast traffic volume, an appropriate route, traffic conditions, accurate information about timing, incidents, and which time and roadway for transport are suitable for running and mobility.

This paper combs the historical development process of the theory of land resources carrying capacity from the initial stage to the regional carrying capacity stage, and the relevant research hotspots at home and abroad in recent years. The research on the carrying capacity of land resources gradually began to cross with the directions of ecological environment, socio-economic development, climate change and other disciplines, and the research direction continued to expand. However, at present, there are still some shortcomings in the research on the carrying capacity of land resources, some quantitative research and dynamic monitoring mechanisms are not yet mature, and the evaluation index system of land resources carrying capacity needs to be further improved. At present, the more mature analysis and evaluation methods include TOPSIS method with entropy weight, global Moran's I index method, geographical probe analysis method and so on. In the future, in order to further guide and serve the ecological sustainable development of cities, the research on land resources carrying capacity still needs to be expanded to multi-scale and multi-factor aspects, and more statistical models and machine learning should be introduced to meet the multi-faceted needs of the new era.","",https://doi.org/10.54691/fsd.v3i3.4552,"",,

These sensors can be used on Earth's surface to observe it with a very high spatial resolution, and there is a wide range of near-infrared and non-infrared spectral bands. These spectral ranges allow for a wide array of purposes, like assessing vegetation health land use and land cover changes, coastal and inland water quality assessment, and making disaster maps. In this case study, we mapped and analyzed different types of Sentinel-2 images that imaged Kirkuk city landscape in Iraq. The methodology is based on Artificial Intelligence AI analyzing patterns of Sentinel hub data and Geographic Information Systems (GIS)-based mapping. Furthermore, Minimum Noise Fraction (MNF) and Pixel Purity Index (PPI) were applied on each image to enhance the spectral unmixing accuracy which provides higher precise endmember spectra. Besides a deep neural remote sensing have been used for 10m resolution Sentinel-2 image segmentation of Kikuk. This produces such a result where features are exactly distinguished and identified. This is, performed by automatically detecting and classifying features on the image to provide better identification and estimation. Analyzing received data through Sentinel-2 provides us with the basis to identify such patterns, trends, and insights as key facts supporting urban planning, environmental sustainability and so much more.","",https://doi.org/10.47852/bonviewjopr42022920,"",,

However, the combined consideration of the urban green space (UGS), water bodies, buildings, and socio-economic factors is limited. And the diurnal differences in their thermal effects have been less considered. In this study, central Beijing was taken as study area. Local climate zones (LCZ) were firstly applied to reveal spatiotemporal heterogeneity of LST. Then, the interpretable machine learning methods were utilized to quantitatively reveal nonlinear thermal effects of urban multidimensional characteristics, i.e., the UGS, water bodies, and building landscape features, and socio-economic features. The results indicated that built type LCZs have a higher average LST compared to natural type LCZs. And the LST of built type LCZs is simultaneously influenced by buildings' density and height characteristics. Daytime LST is mainly affected by the landscape proportions of UGS, buildings, and trees, while nighttime LST is more influenced by socio-economic and building characteristics. The thermal effects of key factors exhibit nonlinear characteristics. Whether during the day or night, the impact of building coverage on LST is greater than that of building height, consistently exhibiting a warming effect. While, the building height and water body edge density factors both exhibited a reversal trend in their thermal impact between day and night. Our study also emphasized the importance of trees type in UGS and provided recommendations for UGS planning based on sensitivity and contribution considerations.

In this study, machine learning (ML) namely Random Forest (RF), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and Support Vector Machine Regression (SVR) were used to develop generic AGB estimators for urban trees using the diameter at breast height, total height, and dry wood density of 1051 individual urban trees. The results from the ML were compared with the outputs from a generic allometric equation that was developed using a destructive method. The results showed that the ML represents a good alternative to the traditional destructive method with R2 above 0.9 during training, and R2 above 0.8 during testing. The RF and XGBoost performed better than SVR in the prediction of AGB. However, overall, the AGB predicted using ML was more accurate than the AGB estimated with a generic allometric equation. The generic AGB estimator improves urban forest management by providing an accurate AGB which can support decision-making and can be used for planning, carbon accounting, and monitoring as well as tree species selection and maintenance.KEYWORDS: Urban forestsmachine learningabove-ground biomassallometric equation Disclosure statementNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s).Data availability statementThe data and code used in this study was not deposited and do not have URI.

rayyan-210783237,A fuzzy-based emotion detection method to classify the attractiveness of urban green spaces,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract In European studies, the most used definition of Urban Green Spaces (UGS) is based on the European Urban Atlas, which includes public green areas primarily used for recreation and green areas adjacent to urban areas that are managed or utilized for recreational purposes. UGS play a vital role in creating sustainable and resilient cities, as they provide essential social benefits for the well-being and health of urban residents. Both planners and scientists acknowledge the importance of involving, actively or passively, citizens in defining criteria for designing and managing inclusive and functional UGS. According to a post-normal science approach, the integration of hard data from scientific sources with soft data gathered from citizens’ engagement holds the potential to shape an innovative support system for public policies addressing significant, urgent, and uncertain challenges pertaining to UGS. Nowadays, the abundance of data generated through online reviews, opinions, and comments allows for collecting valuable information about people’s opinions and sentiments towards UGS. This study proposes a methodological framework that utilizes emotion detection techniques to identify and analyze citizens’ emotions concerning UGS through social reviews. To balance computational costs and classification accuracy, the framework introduces a fuzzy emotion-based classification method called FREDoC (Fuzzy Relevance Emotions Document Classification). This method incorporates a lightweight natural language pro-cessing (NLP) approach to detect and annotate terms associated with specific emotional categories within the text. The framework adopts the psycho-evolutionary classification approach based on R. Plutchik’s observations of general emotional responses. This model is implemented within a Geographical Information System (GIS) for the purpose of categorizing UGS, specifically green parks, according both to WHO report key indicators and to the detected relevant emotions. The outcome is a novel classification model of UGS that can assist decision-makers in identifying the attractiveness of UGS as catalysts for urban transformation processes.","",https://doi.org/10.1007/s12065-024-00964-1,"",,

Despite its critical importance for policy, our ability to effectively monitor and track urban change remains limited. Deep learning-based computer vision methods applied to street-level images have been successful in the measurement of socioeconomic and environmental inequalities but did not fully utilize temporal images to track urban change, as time-varying labels are often unavailable. We used self-supervised methods to measure change in London using 15 million street images taken between 2008 and 2021. Our novel adaptation of Barlow Twins, Street2Vec, embeds urban structure while being invariant to seasonal and daily changes without manual annotations. It outperformed generic pretrained embeddings, successfully identified point-level change in London's housing supply from street-level images, and distinguished between major and minor change. This capability can provide timely information for urban planning and policy decisions towards more liveable, equitable, and sustainable cities.","",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compenvurbsys.2024.102156,"",,

The implementation of methodologies for predicting and managing environmental impacts is vital. One such methodology is Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), which, related to energy simulations in buildings, characterises a more sustainable construction practice that surpasses the notion of a green building. To attain further enhancement, building material choices based on physical, mechanical and chemical properties should be thoroughly examined. Finally, monitoring building interventions is crucial for planning maintenance and tracking their current status in real-time.This investigation seeks to contextualise the function of construction materials, specifically bio-based plant fibre materials, in scientific research.

Global mapping of buildings has been made more efficient with the incorporation of deep learning models into the pipeline. However, these models typically rely on high-resolution satellite imagery which are expensive to collect and infrequently updated. As a result, building coverage data are not updated timely especially in developing regions where the built environment is changing quickly. In this paper, we propose a method for estimating building coverage using only publicly available low-resolution satellite imagery that is more frequently updated. We show that having a multi-node quantile regression layer greatly improves the model's spatial and temporal generalization. Our model achieves a coefficient of determination ($R^2$) as high as 0.968 on predicting building coverage in regions of different levels of development around the world. We demonstrate that the proposed model accurately predicts the building coverage from raw input images and generalizes well to unseen countries and continents, suggesting the possibility of estimating global building coverage using only low-resolution remote sensing data.","",https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2301.01449,"",,

Recently, image classification techniques using neural networks have received considerable attention in sustainable urban development, since their applications have an extreme effect on building distribution, infrastructural networks, and water resource management. In this research, a back-propagation shallow neural network model is presented for very high resolution satellite image classification in urban environments. Workflow procedures consider selecting and collecting data, preparing required study areas, extracting distinctive features, and applying the classification process. Visual interpretation is performed to identify observed land cover classes and detect distinctive features in the urban environment. Pre-processing techniques are implemented to present the used images in a more suited form for the classification techniques. A shallow neural network model (supported by MathWorks MATLAB environment) is successfully applied and results are evaluated. The proposed model is tested for classifying both WorldView-2 and WorldView-3 multispectral images with different spatial and spectral characteristics to check the model’s applicability to various kinds of satellite imagery and different study areas. Model outcomes are compared to two well-known classification methods; the Nearest Neighbour object-based method and the Maximum Likelihood pixel-based classifier, to validate and check the model stability. The overall accuracy achieved by the proposed model is 86.25% and 83.25%, while the nearest neighbour approach has obtained 84.50% and 82.75%, and the maximum likelihood classifier has accomplished 82.50% and 80.25% for study area 1 and study area 2 respectively. Obtained results indicate that the developed shallow neural network model achieves a promising accuracy for urban land cover classification in comparison with the standard techniques.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/isprs-annals-x-1-w1-2023-57-2023,"",,
rayyan-210783266,Space technology: A powerful tool for safeguarding world heritage,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"The Convention Concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage (WHC), adopted by United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) on November 16, 1972, aims to ensure the identification, protection, conservation, presentation, and transmission to future generations of the world's cultural and natural heritage. The WHC works toward these goals by emphasizing the Outstanding Universal Value (OUV) of heritage sites and the unique contribution such places can make to conservation and human development agendas.1UNESCO, United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization. Operational Guidelines for the Implementation of the World Heritage Convention. Paris, France: UNESCO, 2021.Google Scholar As of the end of January 2023, the WHC has been signed by 194 state parties, covering 1,157 sites (including 900 cultural, 218 natural, and 39 mixed properties), 55 of which are considered to be in danger. These sites, totaling an area of more than 370 million hectares are designated as World Heritage (WH) sites (https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/). WH sites have played a significant role in the sustainable development of society globally and helped effectively maintain and preserve the cultural diversity and global biodiversity of the Earth.2Luo L. Wang X. Guo H. Contribution of UNESCO designated sites to the achievement of sustainable development goals.Innovation. 2022; 3100227Google Scholar However, WH sites around the world are experiencing significant impacts caused, in large part, by increasing anthropogenic threats (such as the rapid spread of urban sprawl, deforestation, resource overexploitation, air pollution, armed conflict, excessive tourism, and poor management).3Allan J.R. Venter O. Maxwell S. et al.Recent increases in human pressure and forest loss threaten many Natural World Heritage Sites.Biol. Conserv. 2017; 206: 47-55Crossref Scopus (104) Google Scholar There is also a range of overarching, long-term global challenges posed by climate change, extreme and severe weather events and geological hazards.4Vousdoukas M.I. Clarke J. Ranasinghe R. et al.African heritage sites threatened as sea-level rise accelerates.Nat. Clim. Chang. 2022; 12: 256-262Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar These threats, anthropogenic or otherwise, have put an unprecedented amount of pressure on the protection of both cultural and natural properties at the heritage sites. There is no conclusive solution to effectively protect heritage sties in the foreseeable future, and the public is becoming increasingly conscious about the negative impacts some anthropogenic activities have brought to heritage sites, exposing them to various risks for irreversible damage and loss. In light of this predicament, UNESCO, alongside its conservation partners, has been actively calling for the use of non-intrusive space technology (ST) to better evaluate and understand the detrimental factors surrounding WH sites and devise effective plans to mitigate negative impacts on OUV through the accurate identification, documentation, monitoring, and understanding of WH sites and their changes across large spatiotemporal scales. For this commentary, ST refers mainly to remote sensing (RS) based on Earth observation (EO) from space, as well as other geospatial information technologies such as geographic information systems (GIS) and global navigation satellite systems (GNSS). Even though ST was not developed intentionally for WH protection, it provides an advanced set of innovative and flexible tools that integrate scientific research into heritage science, which forms the evidential base to support measures for the protection of WH sites. ST also opens up paths of methodological innovation to facilitate future conservation of cultural and natural properties with new paradigms. On the basis of a half-century review of the applications of ST in the field of WH, we find that ST has effectively reshaped our means for WH conservation in four major domains of application: mapping, monitoring, modeling, and management of WH sites (Figure 1A). ST, as an objective and reliable ""eye"" from above for heritage experts, has enabled detailed mapping of heritages at various scales. This application commonly involves the acquisition and updatable analysis of multimodal datasets, combined with near real-time survey and investigation of WH sites and their contextual environments. ST is also an invaluable tool in identifying and designating potential new WH sites. The widespread integration of ST has played a crucial role in UNESCO's routine monitoring and emergency monitoring of cultural and natural heritages as a countermeasure to the challenges presented by global change. In particular, ST has made major contributions to fine-grained monitoring at very high resolutions in time and space and in assessing change caused by natural and/or anthropogenic processes. The combined application of RS, GIS, and augmented reality has facilitated the production of three-dimensional (3D) modeling of WH sites. In addition, photogrammetry and laser scanning can be used in WH surveys for generating 3D documentation of cultural and natural properties. Heritage information models of some popular WH sites have already been actively used in the fields of architecture study and digital ecology. The ability of ST to contribute to the conservation, planning, and management of WH sites has already been commonly used in the following domains: the definition of authenticity and integrity (AI), the mapping of OUV attributes of cultural and natural assets, the development and maintenance of heritage databases, 3D modeling and digital reconstruction, and informing WH management for sustainable development. The UNESCO WHC refers to its ""strategic objectives"" as the ""5 C's"": credibility, conservation, capacity building, communication, and communities.1UNESCO, United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization. Operational Guidelines for the Implementation of the World Heritage Convention. Paris, France: UNESCO, 2021.Google Scholar Here, we propose five key contributions (""5 D's"") of ST for conservation work involving WH sites (see Figure 1B): data, driver, discovery, digital transformation, and decision support. ST and the 5 D's, together with the WHC, constitute the ""turbine model"" for safeguarding WH that is proposed in this commentary and will assist in achieving the 5 C's over the next 50 years. By providing massive multi-source data, ST plays a crucial role in the WH governance chain. Archived data together with ongoing data acquisition record changes at WH sites and provide evidence for their conservation. The data collected through ST will, in turn, serve as an invaluable store of not only raw observations but also derivative products that can be extracted from imagery.5Levin N. Ali S. Crandall D. et al.World Heritage in danger: big data and remote sensing can help protect sites in conflict zones.Global Environ. Change. 2019; 55: 97-104Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar As a result of this data mechanism, ST will be able to mitigate the problem of lacunae in WH data by offering global coverage and consistency. ST is driving a revolution to become a new paradigm of WH protection. It provides advanced tools, such as RS data processing and GIS spatial analysis powered by machine learning, which can be used for dynamic monitoring and spatiotemporal analysis of changes that are occurring at WH sites. From this enhanced monitoring method, WH specialists and managers are empowered with the tools to monitor change over time and to assess whether conservation efforts to mitigate the impacts of natural and anthropogenic processes are contributing to positive outcomes toward sustainability. ST plays a key role in aiding frontier research across multiple disciplines related to heritage science. Scientific discoveries based on the use of new geospatial technologies and big EO data can be applied to the quantitative assessment of the state of WH protection. They can also be used to support deepened multidimensional interpretations of the OUV of WH sites, to guide the sustainable use of WH, and to improve accessibility so that all stakeholders may obtain unbiased and open information, thus increasing the credibility of WH as a global brand. ST provides a means of digital transformation that can be used for identifying, understanding, visualizing, presenting, and interpreting WH sites and their OUV in the digital space. In the future, ST will promote the transformation of WH protection through studies such as tangible heritage, digitalized heritage, or both. GIS-aided digital transformation will greatly improve the quality and efficiency of global communication and the dissemination of information related to WH sites, promoting public awareness of protection concepts and smoothing the implementation of actions. ST is becoming an invaluable tool to provide decision-making support along the entire chain of WH governance, from mapping to monitoring, modeling, and management. ST-based solutions could offer spatial intelligence to inform strategic decision making for multiple stakeholders, including local communities, WH sectors, institutions, and organizations. It offers an innovative path for capacity building and capacity enhancement in relation to the global governance of WH. These solutions are delivered in numerous ways, including databases, technologies, protocols, visualization platforms, and analytical systems. WH is under the influence of a wide array of anthropogenic and natural processes, giving the heritage bodies and national and international organizations promoting the preservation of WH sites an unprecedented opportunity to use science, technology, and innovation, including ST, to experiment innovative solutions and promote the role of WH in achieving sustainable development. Given that natural and anthropogenic challenges can present similar issues in various regions across the globe, it is evident that sharing knowledge and expertise, as well as developing collective strategies to leverage ST, while tailoring our methods to local circumstances, will be fundamental in developing a global approach for WH that is successful in the long run. The past 50 years of applications have resulted in continuous innovation in the development of ST to become powerful, cutting-edge tools for use in heritage documentation, monitoring, assessment and protection, and sustainable development. Although the progress is promising, we must underscore that relying solely on ST is insufficient; the greatest benefits are achieved by integrating ST with a variety of disciplines, such as management, economics, sustainability, sociology, education, ethics, politics, law, art, and aesthetics. Through closer and sustained engagement with a broader cross-section of society and local communities, ST can contribute to opening new horizons for WH protection over the course of the twenty-first century.

We anticipate that this pattern will become more evident, notably in South Africa. Therefore, research on urban spirals, both past and projected, is necessary for efficient urban land use planning and management. This study aims to assess the spatio-temporal urban sprawl dynamics from 2003 to 2033 in Mbombela, South Africa. We employed robust approaches such as machine learning, the cellular automata-Markov chain, and the Shannon entropy model to look at how urban sprawl changes over time using both the Landsat 4–5 Thematic Mapper and the 8 Operational Land Imagers. We conducted this study to bridge the gaps in existing research, which primarily focuses on past and current urban growth trends rather than future trends. The findings indicated that the coverage of built-up areas and vegetation has expanded by 1.98 km 2 and 13.23 km 2 between the years 2003 and 2023. On the other hand, the amount of land continues to decrease by -12.56 km 2 and − 2.65 km 2 annually, respectively. We anticipate an increase in the built-up area and vegetation to a total of 7.60 km 2 and 0.57 km 2 , respectively, by the year 2033. We anticipate a total annual decline of -7.78 km 2 and − 0.39 km 2 in water bodies and open land coverage, respectively.

This method has significant potential for effective photovoltaic (PV) shading risk management and decision-making in PV system configuration and sustainable urban design.","",https://doi.org/10.26868/25222708.2023.1273,"",,
rayyan-210783276,THE ROLE AND IMPACT OF VEGETATION ON THE URBAN FABRIC. CASE OF GUELMA CITY,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"In cities, land use changes caused by various human activities can affect how natural ecosystems function. In this context, it is increasingly important for cities to consider the role of vegetation in preserving a sustainable environment. A diachronic analysis of landscape changes was applied to assess the presence and distribution of vegetation to determine whether it was evolving or regressing. This phenomenon was studied within the current administrative boundaries of the city of Guelma (Algeria). For this purpose, as an approach based on landscape metrics, several Landsat TM and ETM+ remote sensing satellite images were used throughout the period 1987-2019. A set of landscape indices, including NP, AREA_MN, LPI, PLAND, AI and LSI, were calculated to map land cover, the mechanism of land cover and vegetation change, and their impact on the urban ecosystem. The geo-statistical procedure was carried out using a geographic information system Qgis combined by statistical software using Fragstats to calculate various landscape metrics at class level for the analysis of fragmentation . The results of the landscape metric analysis show that the decrease in average area and the increase in the number of green patches are important indicators of land degradation, meaning that the mechanism of landscape degradation and transformation is progressive. This underlines the need to give particular attention to land use and land cover in the region to ensure the sustainable allocation of natural resources.","",https://doi.org/10.31435/rsglobal_ijitss/30092024/8262,"",,

rayyan-210783284,Who can access what? Uncovering urban inequality in access to service for senior citizens,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"The scarcity or lack of access to essential services at the local and neighbourhood levels in cities can result in significant spatial inequalities, as some areas and their residents can deal with disadvantages and a lower quality of daily life. In particular, the spatial distribution and the variety of amenities at the local scale represent an important feature of the liveliness of places. The local availability and access to essential services are particularly relevant for some demographic groups experiencing limited mobility or mobility poverty, such as older adults living in cities, and spatial disparities have been further exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, which highlighted severe difficulties in accessing essential services. This work explores the issue focussing on the following question: who can access what depending on where they live in cities? Using Machine Learning and Spatial Autocorrelation applied to different data sources for spatial information on the location of urban amenities and Internet access, this work aims to identify the most underserved places in terms of the variety of available amenities and access to quality broadband in three European capital cities. A comparison to urban areas where high percentages of older adults reside makes it possible to identify where residents can locally access several essential services (green spaces, health care, and local shopping) and where this need cannot be satisfied because of a lack in the amenity variety available at walking distance to their home. The combination of underserved areas with a high concentration of senior residents identifies left-behind areas in these cities, where interventions on inequalities are most needed. Results can inform policies aiming at favouring fair access to services at the local scale, possibly including slow and active mobility modes, and in general to develop comprehensive and sustainable planning strategies for cities, leaving no place and no person behind.","",https://doi.org/10.1177/23998083241260757,"",,

Current studies of UGB delineation and its indicators have paid little attention to human factors such as human activities and economic vitality, and weights for evaluation indicators have been determined highly subjectively. In response to these problems, this study integrated multi-source geographic big data to construct a total of 30 natural, human, and ecological evaluation indicators. The GIS technology and machine learning (ML) approach were combined to determine indicator weights with an officially manually drawn 2035 UGB as the reference, aiming to reduce the subjectivity. The suitability score was then calculated from indicator grading 4-1 and related weights, and high suitability (>2.15) regions were eventually delineated as the UGB. Results showed a delineated UGB of 1,528.06 km2 with an overall accuracy of over 93% and high consistence with reference data for 2035 in the Chinese city of Changsha. The geographic big data totally contributed more than 33.72%, which mainly characterized role of human elements, and a 5-6 percentage point reduction in accuracy was found without these data. Compared with existing studies, our delineated UGB had higher accuracy and closer spatial pattern to the reference data, verifying the effectiveness and reasonability of ML-based weight setting approach and index system with geographic big data. The proposed method can provide scientific and accurate framework for UGB delineation, which can promote the territorial spatial planning and sustainable urban development.","",https://doi.org/10.1109/jstars.2024.3389503,"",,

This analysis delves into the waste management issues in Costa Rica, particularly in urban areas such as San Jos&amp;eacute;, responsible for nearly half of the country's waste. The study identifies several pressing concerns, including the heavy burden on landfill capacities, a recycling rate of just 9.6%, and substantial regional differences in waste management practices.To address these challenges, the research employs a combined methodology, utilizing Linear Regression (LR) and AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models to project future trends in CO2e emissions and waste minimization from 2024 to 2050. This method underscores the vital need for public involvement and the introduction of innovative strategies in waste management. The research also introduces a Waste Management Innovation Index to compare Costa Rica&amp;rsquo;s practices with those of leading nations like Germany and South Korea, identifying key areas for improvement.Furthermore, the study incorporates insights from stakeholders, revealing the intricate balance of cultural, economic, and regulatory factors that shape waste management policies. Despite efforts by the government, such as the Environmental Health Route and the National Circular Economy Strategy, results show limited progress, particularly in rural regions. The study highlights the urgent need for better infrastructure, targeted public awareness campaigns, and the use of advanced technologies like Artificial Intelligence (AI) and blockchain to enhance sustainable waste management practices. The research provides strategic recommendations to help Costa Rica improve its waste management systems in line with international standards, ensuring long-term environmental sustainability and protection of public health.","",https://doi.org/10.20944/preprints202408.0274.v6,"",,
rayyan-210783309,Predicting building energy consumption in urban neighborhoods using machine learning algorithms,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract Assessing building energy consumption in urban neighborhoods at the early stages of urban planning assists decision-makers in developing detailed urban renewal plans and sustainable development strategies. At the city-level, the use of physical simulation-based urban building energy modeling (UBEM) is too costly, and data-driven approaches often are hampered by a lack of available building energy monitoring data. This paper combines a simulation-based approach with a data-driven approach, using UBEM to provide a dataset for machine learning and deploying the trained model for large-scale urban building energy consumption prediction. Firstly, we collected 18,789 neighborhoods containing 248,938 buildings in the Shanghai central area, of which 2,702 neighborhoods were used for UBEM. Simultaneously, building functions were defined by POI data and land use data. We used 14 impact factors related to land use and building morphology to define each neighborhood. Next, we compared the performance of six ensemble learning methods modeling impact factors with building energy consumption and used SHAP to explain the best model; we also filtered out the features that contributed the most to the model output to reduce the model complexity. Finally, the balanced regressor that had the best prediction accuracy with the minimum number of features was used to predict the remaining urban neighborhoods in the Shanghai central area. The results show that XGBoost achieves the best performance. The balanced regressor, constructed with the 9 most contributing features, predicted the building rooftop photovoltaics potential, total load, cooling load, and heating load with test set accuracies of 0.956, 0.674, 0.608, and 0.762, respectively. Our method offers an 85.5%-time advantage over traditional methods, with only a maximum of 22.75% of error.","",https://doi.org/10.1007/s44243-024-00032-3,"",,

In this paper, a model was proposed for evaluating and predicting the coordination between water use and industrial ecosystem development. First, aiming at the coordination of water use and industrial ecosystem development, this paper determined 15 indicators from the aspects of water demand and supply, water conservation and environmental protection, industrial sustainable development, input and output, and industrial development status. The combination weighting method based on game theory was used to determine the weight of the evaluation index. Then, the coordination evaluation model called the back propagation neural network (BP)–coupling coordination degree model (CCDM) and the coordination prediction model called gray models (GM)–BP–CCDM were established. Finally, the model was applied to the coordination evaluation and prediction of water use and industrial ecosystem development in the Hebei Province, China. The results show that the coordination degree of cities in the Hebei Province is moderate. Therefore, based on the research results, some scientific and reasonable suggestions for water resources utilization and industrial ecosystem development were put forward.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph20032381,"",,
rayyan-210783314,Advancing terrestrial biodiversity monitoring with satellite remote sensing in the context of the Kunming-Montreal global biodiversity framework,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Satellite remote sensing (SRS) provides huge potential for tracking progress towards conservation targets and goals, but SRS products need to be tailored towards the requirements of ecological users and policymakers. In this viewpoint article, we propose to advance SRS products with a terrestrial biodiversity focus for tracking the goals and targets of the Kunming-Montreal global biodiversity framework (GBF). Of 371 GBF biodiversity indicators, we identified 58 unique indicators for tracking the state of terrestrial biodiversity, spanning 2 goals and 8 targets. Thirty-six shared enough information to analyse their underlying workflows and spatial information products. We used the concept of Essential Biodiversity Variables (EBV) to connect spatial information products to different dimensions of biodiversity (e.g. species populations, species traits, and ecosystem structure), and then counted EBV usage across GBF goals and targets. Combined with published scores on feasibility, accuracy, and immaturity of SRS products, we identified a priority list of terrestrial SRS products representing opportunities for scientific development in the next decade. From this list, we suggest two key directions for advancing SRS products and workflows in the GBF context using current instruments and technologies. First, existing terrestrial ecosystem distributions and live cover fraction SRS products (of above-ground biomass, ecosystem fragmentation, ecosystem structural variance, fraction of vegetation cover, plant area index profile, and land cover) need to be refined using a co-design approach to achieve harmonized ecosystem taxonomies, reference states and improved thematic detail. Second, new SRS products related to plant physiology and primary productivity (e.g. leaf area index, chlorophyll content & flux, foliar N/P/K content, and carbon cycle) need to be developed to better estimate plant functional traits, especially with deep learning techniques, radiative transfer models and multi-sensor frameworks. Advancements along these two routes could greatly improve the tracking of GBF target 2 ('improve connectivity of priority terrestrial ecosystems), target 3 ('ensure management of protected areas'), target 6 ('control the introduction and impact of invasive alien species'), target 8 ('minimize impact of climate change on biodiversity'), target 10 ('increase sustainable productivity of agricultural and forested ecosystems') and target 12 ('increase public urban green/blue spaces'). Such improvements can have secondary benefits for other EBVs, e.g. as predictor variables for modelling species distributions and population abundances (i.e. data that are required in several GBF indicators). We hope that our viewpoint stimulates the advancement of biodiversity monitoring from space and a stronger collaboration among ecologists, SRS scientists and policy experts.","",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2023.110773,"",,

As a typical watershed of a faulted basin, studying the influence of landscape pattern changes on runoff and sediment yields in the Nandong underground river system (NURS) helps to establish the relationship between watershed and runoff and sediment changes. It provides a theoretical basis and effective method for water and soil management assessment, and soil and water treatment in karst fault basins. The vegetation topographic factor (VTF) was constructed using the normalized vegetation index (NDVI), digital elevation model (DEM) and water-system map from 2000 to 2018. On the basis of VTF classification, the vegetation topographic landscape index (VTLI) was calculated using the FRAGSTATS software, and the effects of VTLI changes on NURS runoff and sediment yield were analyzed. The study found the following: (1) PD, IJI, LSI and SHDI were positively correlated with runoff and sediment yield (p &lt; 0.01), and the correlation coefficients were 0.693, 0.668, 0.551 and 0.582 and 0.62, 0.635, 0.627 and 0.63, respectively. AI and CONNECT were significantly negatively correlated with runoff and sediment yield (p &lt; 0.01), and the correlation coefficients were −0.551 and −0.596, −0.627 and −0.446, respectively. The LPI and DIVISION index were not significantly correlated with discharge, but were significantly correlated with sediment yield (p &lt; 0.05), and the correlation coefficients were −0.179 and 0.271, respectively. (2) The interpretation of VTLI for runoff increased from 0.639 to 0.778, and the interpretation of sediment transport decreased from 0.809 to 0.613. (3) In urban areas, VTF decreased and was persistent. VTF increased in the basin mountain edge area. In mountainous areas, VTF was unchanged, but has an antipersistence trend. The NURS ecological restoration project had achieved obvious results, and the change in the watershed increased runoff production and reduced sediment production. The capacity of soil and water conservation in the high slope area of the mountain edge of the basin recovered and showed a trend of sustainable development. Due to the urban expansion brought about by economic development, the capacity of soil and water conservation around the city has declined, and it showed a sustainable development trend. Policymakers should strengthen the ecological environment of urban areas and coordinate development within mountainous areas.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/su15010835,"",,

The term “land use” relates to how humans are using the landscape, whether it is for expansion, conservation, or a combination of the two. Human activity on the Earth’s surface alters the land cover area. These adjustments greatly affect how well-functioning vital Earth system components (such as the balance of energy, soil, and water). Applications for remote sensing make it possible to analyses land changes quickly and affordably. Numerous researchers have created techniques for analyzing modifications in the LULC. This study used GIS and random forest machine learning technique to pinpoint the LULC changes in Muzaffarpur District’s urban and rural areas in the span of 15 years i.e., 2005 to 2020. The User land is scattered throughout the western region. The district’s soil becomes more salinized and alkaline as a result of the waterlogging that is also prevalent in some areas of the district. This study’s technique is simple and inexpensive. Between 2005 and 2020, there were major variations in the LULC in the research area. The rise in built-up activity is the main cause of the LULC alterations in the studied region. The current study may not be significantly impacted by the LULC changes.

Due to unique natural conditions, the local population distribution exhibits distinct regional characteristics. This study employs the spatial lag model (SLM) from conventional spatial analysis and the random forest model (RFM) from contemporary machine learning techniques. It integrates traditional geographic data, including land cover data and nighttime light data, with geographical big data, such as POI (points of interest) and OSM (OpenStreetMap), to build a comprehensive indicator database. Subsequently, it simulates the spatial population distribution within the urban agglomeration on the northern slopes of the Tianshan Mountains in 2020. The accuracy of the results is then compared and assessed against the accuracy of other available population raster datasets, and the spatial distribution pattern in 2020 is analyzed. The findings reveal the following: (1) The result of SLM, combined with multi-source data, predicts the population distribution as a relatively uniform and nearly circular structure, with minimal spatial differentiation. (2) The result of RFM, employing multi-source data, better captures the spatial population distribution, resulting in irregular boundaries that are indicative of strong spatial heterogeneity. (3) Both models demonstrate superior accuracy in simulating population distribution. The spatial lag model’s accuracy surpasses that of the GHS and GPW datasets, albeit still trailing behind WorldPop and LandScan. Meanwhile, the random forest model significantly outperforms the four aforementioned population raster datasets. (4) The population spatial pattern in the urban agglomeration on the north slope of the Tianshan Mountains predominantly consists of four distinct circles, illustrating a “one axis, one center, and multiple focal points” distribution characteristic. Combining the random forest model with geographic big data for spatialized population simulation offers robust scientific validity and practicality. It holds potential for broader application within the urban agglomeration on the Tianshan Mountains and across Xinjiang. This study can offer insights for studies on regional population spatial distributions and inform sustainable development strategies for cities and their populations.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/su16104106,"",,

In recent years, the concepts of sustainability and sustainable development have constantly come to the attention of researchers and practitioners and museums are no exception to this process. Well-managed museums not only ensure their own sustainability, but also play an important role in the sustainable economic development of different urban regions (Gustafsson and Ijla 2017) and directly influences the development of cultural tourism in a given region as well. Despite the obvious links between museums and sustainability, not much research has explored how museums fit into sustainability, and how can they become sustainable. Based on this, the main research question of my study is: How can a sustainable museum be defined based on the mission statements of European contemporary art museums and according to the value preferences of museum professionals and museum visitors? To answer the research question, the phenomenon of sustainable museums needs to be analyzed from different aspects. Qualitative research methods are applied in the dissertation: systematic literature research, content analysis, critical discourse analysis, Q-method and grounded theory based on interviews. The main scientific contribution of my dissertation are the followings: (1) Identifying 15 key sustainability thematic roles of the museums The research complements the empirical literature on sustainable museums and contributes to broadening the theoretical background. The mission of museums in this context has not been examined before. The research has shed light on the value preferences that define museums and around which they can develop sustainable strategies. (2) Identifying the objectives and roles along which different practices exist in CEE and non-CEE countries. The novelty of the research is that there has been no research on museum sustainability specifically in the context of European contemporary museums. (3) No previous study has measured and compared sustainability indicators at international level. The museums studied operate in different regions of Europe, in very different economic and social contexts. Their comparison is an important contribution to the theoretical literature of sustainable museums and museum management. (4) Identifying 3 dominant perspectives of Hungarian museum professionals for sustainable museum Research has shown that there are several possible approaches to establishing a sustainable museum strategy. Through this research we have contributed to the application of sustainability in practice. (5) Novel identification of the potential tool for enhancing sustainability: personalised museum experiences is the new technological challenge. These are areas in which museums have not yet made much progress, and the inclusion of AI in museum visits is one of the developments that could open up new horizons, and museums should therefore make a greater effort to learn about and apply these solutions. (6) Novel synthesis of the literature on sustainable museums. We have highlighted that the topic is under-researched in tourism. (7) Novel approach using the Q-method to explore the trends that characterise the engagement and mechanism of action of opinion groups. The Q-method is used to explore the trends that characterise the engagement and mechanism of action of opinion groups. (8) Identifying 3 dominant perspectives of young museum visitors for sustainable museum. The research provides insight into the differences and similarities between Generation Z opinion preferences and thus contributes to a deeper understanding of the sustainability of museums from the perspective of future museum visitors.

The utilization of remote sensing imagery enables the real-time surveying and mapping of UGS. By analyzing the spatial distribution and spectral information of a UGS, it can be found that the UGS constitutes a kind of low-rank feature. Thus, the accuracy of the UGS segmentation model is not heavily dependent on the depth of neural networks. On the contrary, emphasizing the preservation of more surface texture features and color information contributes significantly to enhancing the model’s segmentation accuracy. In this paper, we proposed a UGS segmentation model, which was specifically designed according to the unique characteristics of a UGS, named the Green Space Reverse Pixel Shuffle Network (GSRPnet). GSRPnet is a straightforward but effective model, which uses an improved RPS-ResNet as the feature extraction backbone network to enhance its ability to extract UGS features. Experiments conducted on GaoFen-2 remote sensing imagery and the Wuhan Dense Labeling Dataset (WHDLD) demonstrate that, in comparison with other methods, GSRPnet achieves superior results in terms of precision, F1-score, intersection over union, and overall accuracy. It demonstrates smoother edge performance in UGS border regions and excels at identifying discrete small-scale UGS. Meanwhile, the ablation experiments validated the correctness of the hypotheses and methods we proposed in this paper. Additionally, GSRPnet’s parameters are merely 17.999 M, and this effectively demonstrates that the improvement in accuracy of GSRPnet is not only determined by an increase in model parameters.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/f15010197,"",,

rayyan-210783383,Measuring walkability and bikeability for health equity and intervention research: a scoping review,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"ABSTRACTThe purpose of this study was to describe self-report and audit-based measurement tools of neighbourhood walkability and bikeability for health equity and intervention research. We conducted a scoping review following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews guidelines. We searched MEDLINE via PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and SPORTDiscus with full text via EBSCO in March 2022. We extracted data from a total of 35 papers which reported on 23 self-report and 15 audit-based measures assessing walkability and bikeability. Studies spanned multiple regions including Africa, America, Australia, and Europe, but most were conducted in the United States (n = 15), followed by Australia (n = 6). The most used self-report measure was the Neighbourhood Environment Walkability Scale (NEWS), while the audit tools Pedestrian Environment Data Scan and Bridge the Gap Street Segment Tool were each used in two studies. The priority populations most often studied were residents of low socio-economic status/high disadvantage neighbourhoods, racialized groups, women, youth, older adults, and rural populations. Ultimately, there is no one tool that can be recommended for use in all contexts and with all priority populations; rather, tools may require adaptations to specific contexts and populations of interest.KEY POINTSWhat is already known on this subject? Neighbourhood walkability and bikeability are associated with individual and population physical activity.Few studies work with priority populations to assess walkability and bikeability.What does this study add? Few self-report or audit-based measurement tools of walkability and bikeability have been used among priority populations.The most common self-report measure was the Neighbourhood Environment Walkability Scale (NEWS).The most common audit tools were the Pedestrian Environment Data Scan (PEDS) and Bridge the Gap Street Segment Tool.KEYWORDS: Auditbikeabilityequityinterventionself-reportwalkabilityThis article is related to:Research for city practice Disclosure statementNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s).Supplementary materialSupplemental data for this article can be accessed online at https://doi.org/10.1080/23748834.2023.2260133Additional informationFundingFunding to support this work was provided by the Public Health Agency of Canada.

rayyan-210783385,Artificial Neural Networks and Ensemble Learning for Enhanced Liquefaction Prediction in Smart Cities,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"This paper explores how smart cities can cope with land subsidence and liquefaction in the context of rapid urbanization in Japan. Since the 1960s, liquefaction has become an important topic in geotechnical engineering, and great efforts have been made to evaluate the resistance of soil to liquefaction. There is currently a lack of machine learning applications specifically for smart cities in areas such as geological hazards. This study uses two machine learning techniques, artificial neural networks and ensemble learning, to obtain a prediction model with high performance in predicting the bearing layer depth to improve the accuracy of geo-engineering surveys. The model was developed by analyzing actual survey data from 433 locations in Setegaya, Tokyo, by using artificial neural networks (ANNs) and bagging, respectively. The results show that machine learning has great advantages in predicting the bearing layer depth. In addition, compared with a single model such as artificial neural networks, the prediction performance of ensemble learning can be improved by about 20%. Both interdisciplinary approaches can help predict address risks and thus promote sustainable urban development, highlighting the potential of smart cities in the future.","",https://doi.org/10.20944/preprints202409.0243.v1,"",,
rayyan-210783386,"Deep Learning for Slum Mapping in Remote Sensing Images: A Meta-analysis
  and Review",,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"The major Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) 2030, set by the United Nations Development Program (UNDP), include sustainable cities and communities, no poverty, and reduced inequalities. However, millions of people live in slums or informal settlements with poor living conditions in many major cities around the world, especially in less developed countries. To emancipate these settlements and their inhabitants through government intervention, accurate data about slum location and extent is required. While ground survey data is the most reliable, such surveys are costly and time-consuming. An alternative is remotely sensed data obtained from very high-resolution (VHR) imagery. With the advancement of new technology, remote sensing based mapping of slums has emerged as a prominent research area. The parallel rise of Artificial Intelligence, especially Deep Learning has added a new dimension to this field as it allows automated analysis of satellite imagery to identify complex spatial patterns associated with slums. This article offers a detailed review and meta-analysis of research on slum mapping using remote sensing imagery from 2014 to 2024, with a special focus on deep learning approaches. Our analysis reveals a trend towards increasingly complex neural network architectures, with advancements in data preprocessing and model training techniques significantly enhancing slum identification accuracy. We have attempted to identify key methodologies that are effective across diverse geographic contexts. While acknowledging the transformative impact Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in slum detection, our review underscores the absence of a universally optimal model, suggesting the need for context-specific adaptations. We also identify prevailing challenges in this field, such as data limitations and a lack of model explainability and suggest potential strategies for overcoming these.","",https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2406.08031,"",,

In these innovative urban landscapes, wind power is pivotal in the clean energy paradigm. Efficient wind energy utilization hinges on accurate wind power forecasting, essential for energy management and grid stability. This review explores the use of neural network models for wind power forecasting in smart cities, driven by wind power’s growing importance in urban energy strategies and the expanding role of artificial neural networks (ANNs) in wind power prediction. Wind power integration mitigates greenhouse gas emissions and enhances energy resilience in urban settings. However, wind’s inherently variable nature necessitates precise forecasting. The surge in ANN use for wind power forecasting is another key driver of this review, as ANNs excel at modelling complex relationships in data. This review highlights the synergy between wind power forecasting and neural network models, emphasizing ANNs’ vital role in enhancing the accuracy of wind power predictions in urban environments. It covers neural network fundamentals, data preprocessing, diverse neural network architectures, and their applicability in short-term and long-term wind power forecasting. It also delves into training, validation methods, performance assessment metrics, challenges, and prospects. As smart cities champion urban sustainability, neural network models for wind power forecasting are poised to revolutionize urban energy systems, making them cleaner, more efficient, and more resilient.","",https://doi.org/10.1051/e3sconf/202454003012,"",,
rayyan-210783393,Promoting disaster preparedness and resilience by co-developing stakeholder support tools for managing the systemic risk of compounding disasters,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Stakeholders in disaster risk management are faced with the challenge to adapt their risk reduction policies and emergency plans to cascading and compounding events, but often lack the tools to account for the cross-sectoral impacts and dynamic nature of the risks involved. The EU Horizon Europe PARATUS project, which started in October 2022 and will run to October 2026, aims to fill this gap by developing an open-source online platform for dynamic risk assessment that allows to analyze and evaluate multi-hazard impact chains, dynamic risk reduction measures, and disaster response scenarios in the light of systemic vulnerabilities and uncertainties. These services will be co-developed within a transdisciplinary consortium of 19 partners, consisting of research organizations, NGOs, SMEs, first and second responders, and local and regional authorities. To gain a deeper understanding of multi-hazard impact chains, PARATUS conducts forensic analysis of historical disaster events, based on a database of learning case studies, augments historical disaster databases with hazard interactions and sectorial impacts, and exploits remote sensing data with artificial intelligence methods. Building on these insights, PARATUS will then develop new exposure and vulnerability analysis methods that enable systemic risk assessment across sectors (e.g. humanitarian, transportation, communication) and geographic settings (e.g. islands, mountains, megacities). These methods will be used to analyze risk changes across space and time and to develop new scenarios and risk mitigation options together with stakeholders, using innovative serious games and social simulations.The methods developed in PARATUS have been applied in four application case studies. The first one is related to Small Island Developing States (SIDS) in the Caribbean. This case study considers the cross-border impacts of tropical storms, tsunamis, volcanic eruptions, and space weather, and focuses on the development of impact-based forecasting, directed at humanitarian response planning, the telecommunication sector, and tourism. The second case study deals with the local and regional economic impact of hazardous events such as extreme wind, floods, rockfall, mudflow, landslides, and snow avalanches on cross-border transportation in the Alps. The third case study relates to the multi-hazard impact of large earthquakes in the Bucharest Metropolitan Region and focuses on systemic vulnerabilities of the city and emergency response. The fourth application case study is the Megacity of Istanbul which is prone to earthquake hazard chains, such as liquefaction, landslides, and tsunami, as well as to hydrometeorological hazards (extreme temperatures, fires, and flooding). Population growth rates, urban expansion speed, composition, and integration of new migrants (native, foreign, and refugees from countries like Syria and Afghanistan) contribute to the increasing disaster risk.&amp;#160;The project results will be hosted on two stakeholder hubs related to crisis management and humanitarian relief, and provide stakeholders with a set of tools for risk reduction planning in dynamic multi-hazard environments. The service-oriented approach with active stakeholder involvement will maximize the uptake and impact of the project, and help to increase Europe&amp;#8217;s resilience to compounding disasters.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu23-5815,"",,

rayyan-210783397,Spatial Mapping and Prediction of Groundwater Quality Using Ensemble Learning Models and SHapley Additive exPlanations with Spatial Uncertainty Analysis,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"The spatial mapping and prediction of groundwater quality (GWQ) is important for sustainable groundwater management, but several research gaps remain unexplored, including the inaccuracy of spatial interpolation, limited consideration of the geological environment and human activity effects, limitation to specific pollutants, and unsystematic indicator selection. This study utilized the entropy-weighted water quality index (EWQI), the LightGBM model, the pressure-state-response (PSR) framework and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis to address the above research gaps. The normalized importance (NI) shows that NO3− (0.208), Mg2+ (0.143), SO42− (0.110), Cr6+ (0.109) and Na+ (0.095) should be prioritized as parameters for remediation, and the skewness EWQI distribution indicates that although most sampled locations have acceptable GWQ, a few areas suffer from severely poor GWQ. The PSR framework identifies 13 indicators from geological environments and human activities for the SMP of GWQ. Despite high AUROCs (0.9074, 0.8981, 0.8885, 0.9043) across four random training and testing sets, it was surprising that significant spatial uncertainty was observed, with Pearson correlation coefficients (PCCs) from 0.5365 to 0.8066. We addressed this issue by using the spatial-grid average probabilities of four maps. Additionally, population and nighttime light are key indicators, while net recharge, land use and cover (LULC), and the degree of urbanization have the lowest importance. SHAP analysis highlights both positive and negative impacts of human activities on GWQ, identifying point-source pollution as the main cause of the poor GWQ in the study area. Due to the limited research on this field, future studies should focus on six key aspects: multi-method GWQ assessment, quantitative relationships between indicators and GWQ, comparisons of various spatial mapping and prediction models, the application of the PSR framework for indicator selection, the development of methods to reduce spatial uncertainty, and the use of explainable machine learning techniques in groundwater management.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/w16172375,"",,
rayyan-210783400,Assessing air quality and physical risks to E-scooter riders in urban environments through artificial intelligence and a mixed methods approach,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"The need to develop green and smart transport solutions for NetZero cities to reduce carbon emissions through the use of clean energy is driving innovation in cities around the world. A result of this trend is a rise in micro-mobility solutions such as e-scooters in cities around the globe. Nottingham (UK) is one of the cities that conducted an e-scooter pilot scheme permitting the rental of e-scooters to travel around the city in a bid to encourage more sustainable personal transport use. However, to ensure pedestrian safety, e-scooters are required to be ridden on the road network among cars. Hence, giving rise to two potential risks for e-scooter users: the air quality that they breathe and the physical risk of being near cars, whose drivers may be unfamiliar with seeing e-scooters on the road. This study seeks to explore this interaction using a mixed methods approach to explore the experiences of e-scooter riders in respect to their physical safety and exposure to air pollution. The research makes use of two quantitative surveys an international e-scooter user survey n = 801 and a survey of UK car drivers n = 92, focussed qualitative e-scooter rider interviews and quantitative in-depth road data collection trials comprising of air quality particulate sensing, video capturing around the rider and GPS tracking. The in-depth road data was analysed using an AI approach utilising the ASPS approach, the automated sensor and signal processing approach, implemented for image and signal processing to detect the existence of cars alongside the pollution readings. The findings show that e-scooter riders are typically aware of physical dangers to their safety from other road users, as well as how their presence among pedestrians can impact on more vulnerable users; however, they were unaware of the prevalence and effects of air pollution on them whilst riding. The study highlights the need for a multifaceted approach to improvements in safety for micro-mobility users, predominately considering suitable infrastructure to sperate them from motor vehicles and pedestrians but also the need to consider the proximity to emission emitting vehicles, developing infrastructure in green spaces to address these air pollution levels.","",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2024.124282,"",,

After a careful review of the literature, it is found that artificial intelligence is primarily used to enhance efficiency in urban planning processes, contributing to sustainability. The potential for future challenges has accelerated the adoption of artificial intelligence in urban planning by emphasizing the need for resilient, technology-driven cities. It supports more efficient urban design by automating tasks through generative design software, which subdivides plots and applies housing solutions. Artificial intelligence's role expands to multiple areas within the urban planning obligations of a city, including transportation, environment, waste management, education, healthcare, agriculture, risk management, and security. It guides urban planners by improving analytical models for understanding future physical and social community conditions. Artificial intelligence empowers planners to explore new data collection and analysis methods for predicting urban behavior, saving time and resources. It addresses climate change challenges by supporting transportation, waste management, and water use applications. Artificial intelligence technologies continue to advance, urban planning stands to benefit from increased efficiency, data-driven decision-making, and the creation of more sustainable, resilient cities. Urban planners must adapt themselves by acquiring the necessary skills to ensure successful city planning for the future. Overall, Artificial intelligence is contributing heavily to achieving sustainability by integrating past practices, trends, and new AI-based models.","",https://doi.org/10.52700/scir.v5i2.125,"",,
rayyan-210783419,The Global Tree Assessment provides a multifaceted view on the future of tree diversity conservation,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Trees are of exceptional ecological importance, playing a major functional role in the world's ecosystems, while also supporting many other plants, animals and fungi. The conservation status of tree species is therefore of key importance to planning management strategies and prioritising actions. Through the Global Tree Assessment, we now have knowledge about the threat status for tree species globally. In this special issue of Plants, People, Planet, 13 articles provide a multi-faceted view of the impact of the Global Tree Assessment, how we might improve and accelerate future assessments, and how the information can be used to address issues facing ecosystem restoration. The publication of the State of the World's Trees (BGCI, 2021) has reinforced the growing recognition of the importance of trees and forests to Earth's environmental sustainability. Trees perform vital functions for human society, from basic carbon sequestration to making cities more livable. Trees create rich, multi-dimensional habitats for animals, fungi, and other plants. Essentially, human societies and economies rely on the health and diversity of our planet's trees (Rivers et al., 2022, this issue). With the publication of the Global Tree Assessment, we are gaining a comprehensive understanding of the threat status of trees, allowing us to prioritize conservation efforts and create more effective strategies. In this special issue of Plants, People, Planet, a compelling representation of the complex, multi-faceted, and rapidly changing issues addressed by the Global Tree Assessment is provided. The 13 articles include investigations from a number of different viewpoints and scales, from national assessments of highly diverse but relatively poorly known floras to a single protected area, from a taxonomic focus on a single important family to carefully selected but completely known groups of species, and even specific practical issues involved in the reintroduction and restoration of an endangered species. The paper by Barstow et al. (2022) focuses on the assessment of more than 90% of tree species that are endemic to Papua New Guinea. The study provides valuable information on the risk of extinction, major threats, and the conservation and research needs of the country's tree flora. The contribution by Chua et al. (2022) sheds light on the current state of knowledge regarding extinction risk to tree species in Malaysia (one of world's top megadiverse countries for tree species). The study highlights the extent and types of extinction risk faced by several keystone tree families, namely, Dipterocarpaceae, and tree genera of Myristicaceae and Sapotaceae, whose timbers remain highly valued. Linsky et al. (2022) compare the assessments and ex-situ data over time and examine the most recent information available for Magnoliaceae species to guide the development of national and international conservation strategies in the present era. Erkens et al. (2022) examine the impact of human-induced global change on the ecosystem of the globally distributed tropical plant group Annonaceae (Soursop family). The study utilizes distributional data and International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List assessments to better understand the effects of human activity on this plant group. On the other hand Verspagen and Erkens (2022) present a method to rapidly evaluate the conservation status of species with limited available data, which will accelerate the inclusion of species from large groups into the IUCN Red List. In their article, Rivers et al. (2022) discuss the scientists' warning to humanity on the extinction of tree species. They highlight how the loss of tree species will lead to the extinction of many other plants and animals, significantly altering the world's ecosystems. The article also emphasizes that tree extinction will have a negative impact on billions of people, resulting in the loss of livelihoods and benefits. The work highlights the urgent need for a series of actions to avert an ecological, cultural, and socio-economic catastrophe caused by the widespread extinction of tree species. Rønsted et al. (2022) conducted an assessment of the conservation status of tree flora in the Limahuli Valley of the Hawaiian Island of Kaua'I, and developed a restoration plan for 11 endangered tree species using the Global Tree Assessment framework. The article also offers suggestions for creating sustainable, long-term restoration initiatives. Hills et al. (2022) assessed the risk of extinction of six under-studied genera that have ethnobotanical uses, enabling the establishment of conservation priorities. Dhyani et al. (2022) endeavoured to reintroduce the Critically Endangered Buchanania barberi, a tree species that is endemic to the south Western Ghats (a UNESCO World Heritage site) in Kerala, India that has just two mature individuals remaining. In their study, Yang et al. (2022) presented a compelling case of how conservation techniques and research were employed to rescue the critically endangered tree species Acer yangbiense, resulting in it becoming one of the most successful conservation stories. The global relationship between tree species richness and the number of threatened species found in each country remains consistent, particularly among countries with high species richness (Figure 1a). Madagascar is an exceptional global outlier, with 1842 threatened species out of a total of 3129, while Brazil, the richest country in terms of plant species richness, falls within the predicted trend. Generally, many countries with 1000 plant species or fewer fall below the global trend. Most countries with higher than average threat levels compared with the global trend are island nations, such as Sri Lanka, Cuba, the Philippines, and Indonesia, except for Mexico, which Samain et al. (2022) discuss in their paper. The relationship between the proportions of endemic species versus threatened species is considerably more scattered, with island nations generally containing higher proportions of endemic species. However, many nations with higher and lower than average levels of threatened species are also evident. These broad global patterns of the relationships between threat and species richness can highlight outliers and interesting test cases to examine more closely to better understand the factors driving these outcomes. The articles in this special issue generally represent assessments and analyses of the better-known tree groups and geographic regions, highlighting the limited knowledge of tree species distribution and threat in many parts of the world. In Papua New Guinea, where 36% of species are threatened, a significant proportion of species are also data deficient (Barstow et al., 2022). In Mexico, the assessment excludes plant groups for which no monograph exists, resulting in the exclusion of a considerable amount of the overall plant diversity (Samain et al., 2022). Moreover, the most diverse floras often have a higher proportion of rare species. This makes it increasingly challenging to assess them when the geographic distribution data drops below fewer than five observations. On the other hand, in countries like the United States, where species richness is relatively low and collection records are dense, there are very few data deficient species (Carrero et al., 2022). Essentially, our knowledge of plant diversity tends to be most limited in areas where it is most important, highlighting a clear global inequity between temperate and tropical countries in terms of overall knowledge. In species rich countries, like Colombia (Lopez-Gallego & Morales-Morales, 2023), effective approaches are needed to provide rigorous methods to rapidly assess the threat status of trees in large diverse countries. These assessment efforts are still hampered by the substantial fraction of poorly known species, or even undiscovered species, in some of the world's most biodiverse countries. These countries require two key steps: (i) up-to-date comprehensive collections and (ii) monographic taxonomic treatments. However, achieving these steps is difficult and time-consuming. This limit to our knowledge must be accepted and incorporated into our assessments, as several articles in this special issue explore. Traditional and modern methods to accelerate the gathering and sharing of this fundamental knowledge about species distribution and taxonomy, such as specimen digitization, both in the herbarium and the field, collected by both professionals and community scientists, in addition to machine learning techniques for species identification and trait characterization, are needed. An effort to prioritize which elements of the dark matter of conservation can be most effectively addressed and which will remain obscure should be examined in the context of each country's capacity and resources. Challenging theoretical questions also remain around our definition of the currency for all of these assessments: ""how do we meaningfully measure diversity?"". Currently, assessments are conducted on taxonomically recognized species, treating each as a distinct conservation and evolutionary units. Emerging evidence from genomic studies indicates that interspecific gene flow is a major element of species evolution and adaptation and given the very rapid pace of global change and the emerging of novel ecosystems. This interspecific gene flow is expected to occur and likely increase due to human activities. Understanding and incorporating this natural process will help us in planning and coordinating ecological restoration to more effectively to include numerous species as part of a suite of co-evolving taxa, instead of isolated units. Invasive pests and diseases are some of the major threats to tree species across the temperate northern hemisphere, illustrating an interesting dimension of threat as well. In contrast, threats from land conversion and logging impact species based on their rarity and are often indirect, resulting from the destruction of their habitat during timber harvest or land conversion. On the other hand, pests and diseases directly affect the species and can pose a greater threat to common trees. This illustrates the challenges of assessing threats that are not linked to rarity and determine how to manage them. As discussed in several articles of this special issue, deforestation and land conversion into intensive human use remain the biggest threats to tree species globally. Anthropogenic change is driving this very rapid transition from the ecological and evolutionary processes that generated earth's remarkable plant diversity to the intensive and often wasteful production of goods and services. The factors determining these changes are determined by global economies and national governments, which change quickly and without necessarily putting environmental protection at the top of their agenda. We need to assess these threats according to our ability to influence the improvement of the environmental circumstances that can protect and restore tree diversity. In line with the goals of the United Nations Decade on Ecosystem Restoration (https://www.decadeonrestoration.org/), we need to develop comprehensive strategy that outlines crucial steps, such as collecting the plant material, propagation, translocation, and restoration of the species and ecosystems they create. Here, we outline a plant diversity conservation network (Figure 2), where the four primary activities are defined as (1) Document, (2) Grow, (3) Plant, and (4) Manage. We use these terms broadly, so that any activity that relates to documentation, for example, from collecting the plant material to analyzing its genetic material, is included under that activity. Central all of these activities is collaboration and dialogue with information technology and creating, refining, and adopting advanced technologies wherever they are appropriate. These internal activities are further framed by four major external factors: (1) Reality, (2) Funding, (3) Sharing, and (4) Mentorship. The first two impinge upon the conservation activities occurring within the ecosystem while the second two determine the future success and acceptance of the conservation activities. Again, each one of these terms can be substantially elaborated and constitute their own ecosystems. This framing of the plant diversity conservation network allows each participant to focus their efforts on the activities where they have the most influence and to identify the partners which have the most natural and effective means of creating a synergistic effect. The geological concept of the Anthropocene is a compelling mindset from which to examine these issues. Humans have so fundamentally altered the major and minor cycles of nutrients, water, ecologies, and diversity, at global and local scales, that we must accept responsibility for maintaining plant diversity across the entire landscape, from urban centers to the deepest forest. Additionally, we need to do more than simply count our losses, we must anticipate and predict the effect of rapid change on both current and future plant diversity. Given the likely unprecedented and unpredictable environments and ecosystems of the future, current diversity will be challenged to adapt and respond. We need to explore the major activities of the plant diversity conservation ecosystem outlined above in order to determine what will most effectively safeguard the future of plant diversity. We have considerable leverage in all four major activities, but much work and improvement remains to be accomplished. First, the documentation, collection, and analysis of existing diversity need to be accelerated. Much of tree diversity is poorly known, as evidenced here, and we should utilize the latest technologies and approaches to capture its variation, distribution, and history. We also need to utilize advanced modelling techniques, to understand species distributions and how environmental change affects them. This will help us to understand the maintenance of diversity, both genetic and functional, in populations. Second, the power and importance of our ability to grow plant diversity cannot be overstated. We learn a great deal about plant diversity when we grow and propagate it. We also need this plant diversity as stock for future plantings. Finally, this element of the conservation network is one that botanical gardens can most directly control: a real emphasis on ex-situ conservation and propagation is needed to produce the diverse living material for ecosystem restoration projects we envision. We can secure the tenure of our living collections and sustain plant populations given a relatively small number of individuals. Finally, we need to recognize what elements of the network we have little to no control over and engage with actors who do, if any exist. External factors ultimately determine the success of our plant diversity conservation activities and means of integrating and influencing these factors must be recognized from the outset. The recent Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (https://www.cbd.int/gbf/) has highlighted the need for urgent management actions to prevent human-induced extinction of threatened species, through in situ and ex situ conservation and sustainable management practices, and tree conservation ought to be placed at the forefront of these efforts.

However, there are challenges in obtaining urban data to analyze and understand their influence. With the aim of developing innovative methodologies for this type of research, Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) were developed to predict daily and hourly temperatures in urban green spaces from sensors placed in situ for 41 days. The study areas were four urban allotment gardens (with dynamic and productive vegetation) and a forested urban park in the city of Valladolid, Spain. ANNs were built and evaluated from various combinations of inputs (X), hidden neurons (Y), and outputs (Z) under the practical rule of “making networks simple, to obtain better results”. Seven ANNs architectures were tested: 7-Y-5 (Y = 6, 7, …, 14), 6-Y-5 (Y = 6, 7, …, 14), 7-Y-1 (Y = 2, 3, …, 8), 6-Y-1 (Y = 2, 3, …, 8), 4-Y-1 (Y = 1, 2, …, 7), 3-Y-1 (Y = 1, 2, …, 7), and 2-Y-1 (Y = 2, 3, …, 8). The best-performing model was the 6-Y-1 ANN architecture with a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.42 °C for the urban garden called Valle de Arán. The results demonstrated that from shorter data points obtained in situ, ANNs predictions achieve acceptable results and reflect the usefulness of the methodology. These predictions were more accurate in urban gardens than in urban parks, where the type of existing vegetation can be a decisive factor. This study can contribute to the development of a sustainable and smart city, and has the potential to be replicated in cities where the influence of urban green spaces on urban temperatures is studied with traditional methodologies.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/agronomy14010060,"",,

In previous studies on UV detection, the semantic imbalance and feature interaction among cross-modal data have not been comprehensively considered, impacting the accuracy and interpretability of the results. In this work, a cross-modal fusion framework is proposed that integrates high-resolution remote sensing and street view images for UV detection. First, convolutional neural networks (ResNet-50) are used for feature extraction from both remote sensing and street view images. Then, an inner product channel attention module is used to dynamically adjust weights while considering multiangle views of street view images. A cross-modal feature fusion module that incorporates dilation convolution and a global-based feature fusion block is used to enhance feature interaction and fusion. The method has an overall accuracy (OA) of 0.975 for UV classification in a case study of the Guangzhou–Foshan metropolitan area in China, outperforming a set of baseline methods. The integration of remote sensing and street view images improves the OA value by approximately 2%.

Understanding the urban land use and land cover (LULC) dynamic is essential to mitigate such adverse impacts. This study focused on mapping and quantifying the urban extension in Maseru, using Landsat imagery from 1988 to 2019, based on the Support Vector Machines (SVM) classifier. We also simulated and predicted LULC changes for the year 2050 using the cellular automata model of an artificial neural network (ANN-CA). Our results showed a notable increase in the built-up area from 15.3% in 1988 to 48% in 2019 and bare soil from 12.3% to 35.3%, while decreased agricultural land (21.7 to 1.7%), grassland (43.3 to 10.5%) and forest vegetation (5.5 to 3.2%) were observed over the study period. The classified maps have high accuracy, between 88% and 95%. The ANN-CA projections for 2050 show that built-up areas will continue to increase with a decrease in agricultural fields, bare soil, grasslands, water bodies and woody vegetation. To our knowledge, this is the first detailed, long-term study to provide insights on urban growth to planners and other stakeholders in Maseru in order to improve the implementation of the Maseru 2050 urban plan.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/app13105854,"",,

Remote sensing has the potential to mitigate these effects by supporting sustainable development strategies with accurate information on urban growth. Deep learning-based methods have achieved promising urban change detection results from optical satellite image pairs using convolutional neural networks (ConvNets), transformers, and a multi-task learning setup. However, transformers have not been leveraged for urban change detection with multi-temporal data, i.e., >2 images, and multi-task learning methods lack integration approaches that combine change and segmentation outputs. To fill this research gap, we propose a continuous urban change detection method that identifies changes in each consecutive image pair of a satellite image time series. Specifically, we propose a temporal feature refinement (TFR) module that utilizes self-attention to improve ConvNet-based multi-temporal building representations. Furthermore, we propose a multi-task integration (MTI) module that utilizes Markov networks to find an optimal building map time series based on segmentation and dense change outputs. The proposed method effectively identifies urban changes based on high-resolution satellite image time series acquired by the PlanetScope constellation (F1 score 0.551) and Gaofen-2 (F1 score 0.440). Moreover, our experiments on two challenging datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method compared to bi-temporal and multi-temporal urban change detection and segmentation methods.","",https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2406.17458,"",,

Prior cool roof studies measured their efficiency when applied to buildings or objects. However, research on their application is insufficient. Therefore, this study highlights a broader approach to the effectiveness of the cool roof as a key difference from prior research. To do so, the study focuses on revealing the potential benefits of cool roof with practical applicability, by using aerial images to estimate and describe the construction costs and energy savings associated with cool roof construction in a large urban area. This study proceeded as follows. First, aerial images of eight metropolitan cities in South Korea were collected to construct a dataset for remote sensing. A pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model was employed to detect rooftops in each of the images. The detected rooftops were then clustered according to their surface color and their areas were calculated because the current color determines how much energy can be saved by applying cool roofs. Subsequently, a scenario-based cost-benefit analysis was conducted to estimate the benefits of cool roof application. The results show that cool roofs can reduce cooling energy use, thereby reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and increase urban sustainability.","",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.egyr.2024.02.001,"",,

E-bikes, as one of them, are recognized as an ecologically sustainable means of transportation that has significant potential to replace motorized modes of transportation that can improve urban mobility. Relying on artificial intelligence and considering an ecological approach when considering the acceptability of e-bikes by setting a direct question for users influences the development of an innovative way of understanding and evaluating the use of more sustainable modes of transportation. In this regard, this study aims to elucidate the main variables influencing the acceptability of e-bike use using artificial neural network (ANN) models—multilayer perceptron (MLP) and radial basis function (RBF). For training and testing the models, data from a random sample obtained through an online questionnaire, which was answered by 626 residents of Belgrade (Serbia), were used. A multilayer perceptron with nine and seven neurons in two hidden layers, respectively, hyperbolic tangent activation function in the hidden layer and identity function in the output layer, gave better results than the radial basis function model.

However, many floods vulnerable regions like Malawi still lack FVA supporting frameworks in all phases (pre-trans-post disaster). Partly, this is attributed to lack of the evidence-based studies to inform the processes. This study was therefore aimed at assessing households’ flood vulnerability (HFV) in rural and urban areas of Malawi, using case studies of Mtandire Ward in Lilongwe City (LC) and Traditional Authority (T/A) Kilupula of Karonga District (KD). A household survey was used to collect data from a sample of 545 households’ participants. Vulnerability was explored through a combination of underlying vulnerability factors (UVFs)-physical-social-economic-environmental and cultural with vulnerability components (VCs)-exposure-susceptibility and resilience. The UVFs and VCs were agglomerated using binomial multiple logit regression model. Variance independent factor (VIF) was used to check multicollinearity of variables in the regression model. HFV was determined based on flood vulnerability index (FVI). The data were analysed using Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA), artificial neural network (ANN) and STATA. The results reveal a total average score of high vulnerability (0.62) and moderate vulnerability (0.52) on MCA in T/A Kilupula and Mtandire Ward respectively. The results further found low vulnerability to very high vulnerability for the combined UVFs and VCs in the FVI scale range. The study concludes that the determinants of households’ flood vulnerability are in respective order of enviro-exposure, eco-resilience and physio-exposure factors in both study areas. The study recommends that a FVA framework should be applied to promote resilience of communities to mitigate flood risks and support planning and decision-making process in flood risk management.","",https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-3407776/v1,"",,

Satellite imageries and published Ecosystem Service Value (ESV) coefficient with benefits transfer method has been used to estimate ESV in response to Land Use and Land Cover Change (LULC). We used Artificial-neural-network-based cellular automaton (ANN-CA) model to simulate LULC in 2030 and 2050 based on LULC data from 1990 to 2020. Predicted results reveal that agricultural land, barren land, vegetation, and water bodies are likely to decline by 7.56%, 3.06%, 12.22%, and 1.77%, respectively, between 2020 and 2050, but built-up areas are expected to increase by 24.61% owing to urbanization, industrialization, and economic growth. ESV results indicate that vegetation and agriculture make up 70% of the overall ESV, making them the leading LULC groups. The overall ESV could fall by 8.95 US$ ×106/year, mostly due to a decline in agricultural land, waterbodies, and vegetation. This study also identified the contribution of individual Ecosystem Services (ES) functions to the overall ESV. In 2020 and 2050, the ratio of provisioning, regulating, and supporting services to overall ESV is expected to decline from 19.95–8.77%, 39.60–25.60%, and 28.80–13.63%, respectively. On the contrary, the proportion of cultural services to total ESV will rise from 11.66% in 2020 to 52% in 2050, illustrating the rising importance of non-material ecological benefits like as recreation and tourism. The tool utilized in this study, which combines LULC with ES valuation, will aid policymakers and urban planners in current and future sustainable land management.","",https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-4634073/v1,"",,

rayyan-210783738,SOCIAL MEDIA ANALYSIS OF THE PUBLIC PERCEPTION OF URBAN VEHICLE ACCESS REGULATIONS,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Heavy motorisation in the wake of increasing urbanisation is one of the significant transport problems cities face today. There are practical measures under the panoply of urban vehicle access regulations (UVARs) used to stimulate sustainable mobility behaviour changes in the urban population and reduce reliance on passenger car travel. However, the adoption and implementation of such measures are often riddled with challenges, particularly building public acceptability and preserving social justice. Overcoming these challenges will also require cities to understand how the mobility needs of residents change over time. Considering the limitations of conventional data-collection and monitoring approaches, this study explored and analysed the public perception of UVARs over 12 years through natural language processing techniques using social media as a data source. The results show that UVARs are a prominent topic in public discussion and that the average sentiment expressed in tweets tended to be more positive than negative, with a gradual increase observed over the 12-year study period. In addition, the patterns observed in the data and the topics modelled were consistent with the events and talking points in society related to UVARs. Hence, this study demonstrates that social media data can help policymakers assess public sentiments during the ideation, design, implementation, and operational phases of UVARs and other transport policy measures.","",https://doi.org/10.20858/tp.2023.18.1.13,"",,

This necessitates predicting transportation indices to facilitate sustainable urban planning and traffic management. Recent advancements in deep learning research, in particular, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), and their modifications in spatial data analysis such as CityGAN, Conditional GAN, and MetroGAN have enabled urban planners to simulate hyper-realistic urban patterns. These synthetic urban universes mimic global urban patterns and evaluating their landscape structures through spatial pattern analysis can aid in comprehending landscape dynamics, thereby enhancing sustainable urban planning. This research addresses several challenges in predicting the urban transportation index for small and medium-sized Indian cities. A hybrid framework based on Kernel Ridge Regression (KRR) and CityGAN is introduced to predict transportation index using spatial indicators of human settlement patterns. This paper establishes a relationship between the transportation index and human settlement indicators and models it using KRR for the selected 503 Indian cities.

However, vegetation is under critical stress with rapid urbanization and expanding infrastructure footprints. Consequently, mapping of this vegetation is essential in the urban environment. Recently, deep learning for point cloud semantic segmentation has shown significant progress. Advanced models attempt to obtain state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets, comprising multiple classes and representing real world scenarios. However, class specific segmentation with respect to vegetation points has not been explored. Therefore, selection of a deep learning model for vegetation points segmentation is ambiguous. To address this problem, we provide a comprehensive assessment of point-based deep learning models for semantic segmentation of vegetation class. We have selected seven representative point-based models, namely PointCNN, KPConv (omni-supervised), RandLANet, SCFNet, PointNeXt, SPoTr and PointMetaBase. These models are investigated on three different datasets, specifically Chandigarh, Toronto3D and Kerala, which are characterized by diverse nature of vegetation and varying scene complexity combined with changing per-point features and class-wise composition. PointMetaBase and KPConv (omni-supervised) achieve the highest mIoU on the Chandigarh (95.24%) and Toronto3D datasets (91.26%), respectively while PointCNN provides the highest mIoU on the Kerala dataset (85.68%).

However, it should be noted that vertical growth caused by urban renewal has been disregarded, while the horizontal expansion of urban areas has been widely studied. Understanding dynamic land cover change and its impact focusing on the thermal environment is essential for the sustainable management of urban areas. Therefore, the objective of this study is to propose a simple yet effective urban thermal environment investigation strategy that responds to dynamic land cover transformation. The study area is Suwon, Republic of Korea, where the city has recently been experiencing the most extreme urbanization along with explosive population growth. We designed a three-step approach: 1) extraction of temporal local climate zone (LCZ) to monitor the change in land cover due to urban growth over the period 2004 and 2021, 2) retrieval of high spatial-resolution land surface temperature (LST) using artificial intelligence to observe surface energy flux in heterogeneous urban area in detail, and 3) apply the filtering analysis method, which only uses the pixels classified with a higher confidence level, based on deep learning probabilistic approach to reduce the uncertainty of LCZ classification. To construct the temporal LCZ maps with a 30 m spatial resolution and retrieve the downscaled LSTs (DLSTs) with a corresponding spatial resolution, Landsat series satellites, Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM), and land cover map produced by Ministry of Environment were used. We obtained the following results: First, the overall accuracy (OA) of the LCZ classification was higher than 90% in both 2004 and 2021. Second, the average coefficient of determination (R2) and root mean square error (RMSE) of the DLSTs were greater than 0.9 and less than 1 &amp;#176;C, respectively. Third, through our suggested urban thermal environment investigation strategy, this study could find that the results of LST changes were clearly varied by building height and compactness changes. Especially, change of low-rise building to mid-rise building increased LST significantly.

How should the deployment of new urban infrastructure including the energy system guide this transition toward a sustainable future? This study of the rapidly expanding metropolis of Beijing is conducted to address these questions by combining geospatial big data analysis, machine learning, and theories of urbanization. Gradient Boost Decision Tree model is used to investigate the nonlinear associations between the spatial distribution of EV residents and a series of variables related to neighborhood attributes including landuse-mix, building coverage ratio, accessibility to public charging and public transit, and employment density, as well as GDP. The results indicate that the majority of EV users live in near suburban areas, especially the areas around a 10 km radius away from the city center. The discovery that most public charging activities occur within a 1.5 km radius from home suggests an optimal threshold for public charging station deployment. These findings can inform energy management and infrastructure planning at the local and regional levels to promote sustainable urbanization and smarter energy planning.","",https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4392640,"",,
rayyan-210783750,Madrid Metropolitan Forest and the water cycle,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"AbstractIn the context of global warming and increasing aridity in Spain, Madrid's Strategic Planning Office is investing in 4,300 ha of forest to link the existing 27,700 ha of large parks. The 32,000-ha Metropolitan Forest aims to improve the quality of life in the city. It is divided into five zones. The 1,250- ha Zone Four project explores a design alternative to the area's dominant hardscaped plaza and high-maintenance nineteenth-century park from the notion of the artificial pastoral. It magnifies the water cycle in three new and recovered historical aspects: increased floodable areas, a network of natural and artificial green-blue infrastructures, and an increased volume of used regenerated water and sludge to support a palette of forested landscapes. The project also contributes to slow mobility, civic nodes and connectivity infrastructures between the city and the Metropolitan Forest. Historically, compact Mediterranean cities like Madrid have had an aversion to trees. Fortunately, recent initiatives by the city are changing course, allowing both urban forestry and forest urbanism to flourish.Keywords: ForestsMadridgreenbeltwater infrastructurewater cycle Notes1 Retrieved from the Metropolitan Forest website: bosquemetropolitano.madrid.es.2 The Directorate General for Strategic Planning (Direccion General de Planificacion Estrategica, DGPE) has taken on the task of launching the Metropolitan Forested Green Belt project in 2020.

rayyan-210783752,Leveraging Spatial Analysis Techniques for Developing a Climate Resilient and Localized Urban Greening Plan for Pasig City,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract. A recent study has been conducted to evaluate the current state of green spaces in Pasig City, Philippines, and to propose a Climate Resilient and Localized Urban Greening Plan (CRLUGP) to address urban greening that is essential for creating sustainable cities, especially in the face of climate change and urban population growth. The study utilized Geographic Information Systems (GIS), Remote Sensing (RS), and Machine Learning (ML) to map green spaces, analyze climate risks, and identify necessary corrective measures. The findings revealed that Pasig City currently only has 70.18 hectares of green space, which is significantly below the World Health Organization's recommended minimum of nine (9) square meters of green space per capita. Projections indicate that by 2032, the city will need 925.72 hectares of green space to meet the needs of its growing population. Additionally, the study identified a connection between low canopy cover and increased urban heat island effects, with the top 10 barangays showing a canopy cover of only 27.64%, well below the recommended 40%. Moreover, areas with limited green spaces were found to be at a higher risk of flooding, highlighting the importance of more vegetation for managing stormwater and mitigating climate-related risks. The study recommends a strategic approach to urban greening, leveraging spatial analysis for continuous monitoring and evaluation. By integrating spatial technologies and data-driven decision-making, Pasig City aims to establish a more sustainable and resilient urban environment for its residents.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/isprs-annals-x-5-2024-79-2024,"",,

Campbell Indian Cities: Histories of Indigenous Urbanization. Edited by Kent Blansett, Cathleen D. Cahill, and Andrew Needham. Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, 2022. vii + 317 pp. Illustrations, notes, index. $32.95 paper. In 2020, 9.7 million people identified as Native American and Alaskan Native (AI/AN), 2.9% of the total United States population. As of 2022 there are 574 federally recognized AI/AN tribes and 324 federally recognized American Indian reservations. Other tribal communities are state-recognized, and a multitude of Indigenous societies are ethno-politically viable but not federally or state-recognized as ethno-legal entities. The 2020 census also reveals that 87% live outside tribal statistical areas and only 13% live on reservations and trust lands. In fact, approximately 60% to 70% of American Indians and Alaskan Natives live in metropolitan areas. Residential demographics and geography directly contradict the popular public stereotype that most contemporary [End Page 62] Indigenous people are largely rural and living on reservations, a population largely divorced from an urban existence and experiences. The stereotype, as the editors point out, is grounded in the settler colonialism agenda. During the processes of nation-building, Indigenous urban accomplishments prior to the arrival of Europeans were often either grossly undervalued, mythologized, or replaced by European settlements. The impetus for the volume arose, after several working meetings by the participants, to not only build on the existing historical literature but also to offer new directions for Indigenous urbanization. The book is a collection of 12 original presentations composed by an impressive cross-section of academic disciplines, introduced by a synthetic essay. The two essays in Part I demonstrate the continuity of the Native urban sensibilities and traditions during the early era of colonialism, highlighting political economic interactions. A central element is the central roles regional Native societies had in the formation of European cities. Part II, composed of four essays, offers select insights into the development of various European urban areas through the appropriation of Indigenous lands and resources in the 19th century. As the chapters reveal, the employed strategies of dispossession ranged from outright violence and forced removal to legal mechanisms as well as erasure. Despite these colonial processes, Indigenous people remained active agents, playing a role in shaping urban landscapes. The four essays in Part III provide select discussions of 20th-century Indigenous urban experiences. Collectively, the chapters explore how Native American individuals, families, and communities living in urban arenas crafted lifeways, institutions, intertribal networks, and connections to their natal, non-urban communities to foster their Indigenous identities. Contrary to federal policies designed to submerge or meld Native people into the ""mainstream"" fabric of American life through urbanization, Indigenous people constructed and fostered a variety of strategies to sustain being Indigenous. The book concludes with a highlighted glimpse of ongoing interconnections between urban areas and rural reservations. The two chapters graphically expose the false assumption that reservation issues are largely divorced from urban realities in the 21st century. The final essays point out that the dichotomy between rural Indigenous natal homelands and events in urban areas is nonexistent. They are, historically and to the present, intimately connected and impactful. Despite the diversity in scholarly perspectives, approaches, and topics, an overlapping theme, that of ethnic resiliency, is elucidated in the articles that reflect the complexities about the Indigenous experience in living an urban existence. As active agents in their own histories, Indigenous people and communities, while confronting prevailing political structures, nationalistic policies, legal frameworks, as well as colonial agendas, created and sustained a sense of identity and place in urban spaces. As with any collection of readings, Indian Cities: Histories of Indigenous Urbanization is testimony to the burgeoning, wide-ranging scholarship about Native American experiences. At its broadest conception, the urban Indigenous heritage is a vital but sometimes overlooked component of Native American lifeways. Urban indigeneity, whether expressed by tangible or intangible means, provides a sense of belonging, continuity, and collectivity. As this volume aptly illustrates, Native American urban issues are a complex arena that deserves further scholarly attention.

rayyan-210783761,Transforming Urban Planning through Machine Learning: A Study on Planning Application Classification using Natural Language Processing,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Planning for sustainable urban growth is a pressing challenge facing many cities. Investigating proposed changes to the built environment can provide planners and policymakers information to understand future urban development trends and related infrastructure requirements. It is in this context we have developed a novel urban analytics approach that utilises planning applications (PAs) data and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to forecast the housing supply pipeline in Australia. Firstly, we implement a data processing pipeline which scrapes, geocodes, and filters PA data from council websites and planning portals to provide the first nationally available daily dataset of PAs that are currently under consideration. Secondly, we classify the collected PAs into four distinct urban development categories, selected based on infrastructure planning provisioning requirements. Of the five model architectures tested, we found that the fine-tuned DeBERTA-v3 model achieves the best performance with an accuracy and F1-score of 0.944. This demonstrates the suitability of fine-tuned Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) for planning text classification tasks. Finally, the model is applied to classify and map urban development trends in Australia’s two largest cities, Sydney and Melbourne, from 2021-2022 and 2023-2024. The mapping affirms a face-validation test of the classification model and demonstrates the utility of PA insights for planners. Holistically, the paper demonstrates the potential for NLP to enrich urban analytics through the integration of previously inaccessible planning text data into planning analysis and decisions.","",https://doi.org/10.31219/osf.io/fs76e,"",,

Integration of UAV imagery provides high-resolution spatial data, facilitating precise classification of land cover types. Federated learning (FL) ensures data privacy and reduces communication bandwidth usage by enabling model training on local devices (e.g., UAVs) without the need to share data with a centralized server. However, these UAVs have limited resources and often struggle to capture a sufficient number of images for training a model without encountering overfitting. We address the challenges of scarce data samples on UAVs by leveraging DCGAN (Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks) to generate synthetic images, promoting sustainability by minimizing the need for extensive data collection. These synthetic images are used to train local models of UAVs, offering enhanced results while combating overfitting. Our developed FL model achieved an accuracy exceeding 97%, indicating a 7% improvement over Vanilla FL. The proposed sustainable approach exhibits promising outcomes in achieving accurate and scalable land cover and land use classification, showcasing its applicability in environmental monitoring, urban planning, and precision agriculture.","",https://doi.org/10.1109/sustech60925.2024.10553449,"",,

Urban morphology remains mostly undocumented in Southern Africa as an emerging region. Current processes of informal land occupation, changing suburbia and incremental settlement transformation patterns present fragile, yet interesting morphological characteristics that are worthy of interpretation. How are we understanding, representing, and anticipating changing southern urban form and what is the value-add of understanding urban morphology in Southern Africa? In the absence of any formalised network of ISUF in Southern Africa, there is the potential to make a meaningful contribution to urban morphology and its associated processes and agents. Three case study perspectives from practice, research and teaching are explained to understand urban form in South Africa, as follows: 1). community-led data collection on urban form and social practice based on evidence from experiences in Cape Town townships; 2). area-based partnerships based on examples from informal settlement upgrading in Khayelitsha; and 3). deliberate and engaged teaching and learning currently taking place in the urban design programme at the University of Cape Town.

Cities are not only densely populated areas, but also places where a large amount of infrastructure, businesses and services are concentrated. However, cities also face various challenges, one of which is power outages. A large-scale urban power outage is an unexpected event that can be caused by a variety of reasons, including extreme weather, equipment failure, and vandalism. Such incidents cause many serious harms to cities and their residents, not only threatening lives, but also undermining social order, economic stability, infrastructure sustainability, environmental quality and mental health. It is of great significance to implement the emergency response strategy of large-scale urban power outage. These strategies can not only ensure the safety of residents, but also maintain the sustainability of urban infrastructure, reduce social and economic losses, improve the resilience of cities to disasters, protect the environment and resources, and increase public awareness and preparedness [1]. Therefore, city governments and relevant agencies must carefully develop and implement emergency response strategies to mitigate these hazards. Only through effective preventive and emergency measures can cities better protect residents and property and ensure social stability and sustainable development.

This study focuses on the dual pilot policy of low-carbon cities and climate resilient cities, establishing a comprehensive evaluation index system for urban low-carbon resilience that encompasses ecological, economic, social, and institutional dimensions. Utilizing panel data from 286 prefecture-level cities and above in China from 2005 to 2021, this study employs Difference-in-Differences, K-means clustering, Double Machine Learning, and a tri-dimensional policy analysis framework of ""policy instruments—policy pathways—policy objectives."" It provides an in-depth assessment of the dual pilot policy's impact through policy synergy effects, policy tool analysis, and key case studies, supplemented by heterogeneity analysis, mechanism analysis, and cluster analysis. Results indicate that the dual pilot policy significantly enhances the low-carbon resilience of pilot cities, outperforming the effects seen in cities with a singular pilot policy. The policy effects vary among different types of pilot cities, with notably significant impacts in cities facing high temperatures, low temperatures, heavy rainfall, and high disaster risks. Cities characterized by higher levels of low-carbon resilience (categorized as MMHM) manifest more consistent policy synergy effects, whereas cities with lower levels of resilience (classified as LLLL) exhibit some disparities. The study also identifies the strengthening of green technology innovation, human capital development, and communication infrastructure construction as key factors enhancing policy effectiveness. Ultimately, this research underscores the importance of the diversity and combination of policy tools, as well as the multidimensionality and synergy of policy objectives, for effective climate action. It recommends that urban managers consider the synergistic effects of climate change mitigation and adaptation measures when formulating climate policies.","",https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-5309703/v1,"",,

How to quantify street space quality from the perspective of people's perception and explore the relationship between street space quality and street elements has been a topic devoted to research in various fields. The development of big data and computer science provides a new technique for quantitative evaluation of street perception. The downtown area of Haikou city was taken as the research object to verify the method of this study. Street images of this area were used to construct a deep learning scoring model, and six dimensions of beauty, rich, safety, energetic, repression and [1] boredom were used to score perceptions. The six dimensions of perception are further divided into positive perception and negative perception. The top 20% of streetscape with the highest positive perception score was regarded as high-quality street space, while the top 20% of streetscape with the highest negative perception score was regarded as low-quality street space. The results showed that the highly urbanized area (Longhua district) was considered to be safer and more energetic, but at the same time, with higher sense of depression, there were significant differences incommunity perception among different types of POI, and community green space could significantly relieve the perception of depression. Therefore, this paper confirms the key role of urban functions in promoting sustainable urban development from the perspective of subjective perception, and provides scientific support for planning policies in terms of infrastructure service supply.

These UHIs pose significant environmental hazards, contributing to issues such as heat-related mortality, degraded air quality, and elevated heat stress on biodiversity and ecosystems. Moreover, the impact of UHIs is not uniformly distributed due to the heterogeneous nature of urban landscapes and socio-spatial inequities influencing factors like impervious surfaces and vegetation cover. Urban green infrastructure is increasingly valued as a nature-based solution to mitigate UHIs, offering essential ecosystem services (ES) like urban heat mitigation. To analyze the relationship between users' access and dependence on these benefits, we propose a modeling approach that integrates remote sensing, field, and socio-demographic data, along with Artificial Intelligence for Environment and Sustainability (ARIES) and GIS tools. This approach incorporates: i) indicators of UHI exposure and urban heat vulnerability indices; ii) spatial quantification of the supply and demand of urban green infrastructure related to ES for UHI mitigation; iii) spatially explicit (mis)matches of ES supply and demand balance and iv) coupled modelling. We applied it in the &amp;#8216;green&amp;#8217; city of Vitoria-Gasteiz, in the Basque Country as a case study. Our findings evidence the unequal distribution of UHI burdens, with individuals vulnerable to heat experiencing disproportionate impacts, including higher exposure and limited access to temperature-regulating ES. This mismatch between the supply and demand of ES particularly affects disadvantaged communities. Conversely, areas associated with higher income levels indicate reduced vulnerability to heat. Incorporating environmental justice principles into UHI mitigation strategies is essential to ensure equitable outcomes for all residents.

However, when it comes to measuring the built urban fabric and how people walk through it and use, a difficulty has been observed in defining applicable measurement tools. With the intention of identifying the variables that will allow the best characterization of this fabric and movement, a multi-variable analysis methodology from the field of artificial intelligence (AI) is proposed. The main objective of this paper is to prove the capacity of AI as an evolving research method in urban morphology and specifically to evaluate the capacity of such a methodology to measure the way in which people travel through defined multi-levels of typologies of public urban space. The research uses the case of Hong Kong as a dense city that is three-dimensionally activated in terms of its public realm, not just at street level, but also via below ground subways and upper-level walkways, public and quasi-public spaces. This includes the three-dimensional volumetric assessment of public and quasi-public space typologies within a highly dense city. For the purpose of the study, a characterization and term definition of these spaces has been further developed: “Junctions”, “Landmarks”, “Intersections”, “Districts”, “Passages” and “Lobbies” (both outdoor and indoor) based on Lynch’s 5 main key elements (District, landmark, path, edges, node). The results obtained using AI prove to be more robust and rational than those based on a more limited range of tools, evidencing that using AI can offer operational opportunities for better understanding of morphological and typological evolution within the vertical and volumetric built urban fabric.","",https://doi.org/10.3846/jau.2024.18841,"",,

However, despite the occurrence of elevator passenger entrapment in numerous earthquakes, there is a notable lack of studies addressing this sophisticated issue. This study aims to bridge this gap by proposing a novel urban risk assessment model designed to evaluate city‐scale earthquake‐induced elevator passenger entrapment. The model integrates big data and physics‐based approaches. A novel mapping method was developed to estimate city‐scale elevator traffic level based on population heatmap data and deep learning. A process‐based parallel computing scheme was designed to accelerate the assessment. The applicability was demonstrated based on a real‐world urban area comprising 619 buildings. The findings reveal that as the time of the earthquake varies, the risk exhibits significant fluctuations. Additionally, this study highlights that a simplistic correspondence between seismic intensity and passenger entrapment risk can lead to erroneous estimations.","",https://doi.org/10.1111/mice.13287,"",,

The research methodology is a systematic, cross-cultural, interdisciplinary approach to understanding the complex impact of digital technologies on all aspects of sustainable development in digital green smart cities 3.0, in particular on the economic, social and environmental dimensions. It allows for the interaction between digital innovations and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to be considered in a single structure. The Smart City 3.0 concept views the city as an integrated ecosystem. This approach ensures efficient infrastructure management and also helps to reduce environmental impact, improve the quality of life of citizens, and engage them in decision-making. The article examines the pivotal elements of the Smart City 3.0 concept, encompassing the deployment of artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things (IoT), big data and automated systems to enhance the urban environment. It has been demonstrated that the implementation of these technologies can result in a notable reduction in energy consumption, the optimisation of traffic flows, a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, and an enhancement of the environmental sustainability of the city. The study analyses the global exemplars of digital urban management, identifies opportunities and challenges for the development of Ukrainian cities in the direction of smart and green management, and offers recommendations for their adaptation based on global experience.","",https://doi.org/10.30525/2256-0742/2024-10-4-178-185,"",,

Owing to the population’s fluctuating needs, a new and dual perspective of urban space emerges. The Artificial Intelligence (AI) of a territory, or the system of technical diligence associated with the anthropocentric world, makes sense in the context of this temporal mismatch between territorial processes and utilitarian apparatus. This creates cerebral connections between several concurrent decision-making systems, leading to numerous perspectives of the same urban environment, often filtered by the people whose interests direct the information flow till the transformability. In contrast to the conventional methodologies of decision analysis, which are employed to facilitate convenient judgments between alternative options, innovative Artificial Intelligence tools are gaining traction as a means of more effectively evaluating and selecting fast-track solutions. The study’s goal is to investigate the cross-functional relationships between Artificial Intelligence (AI) and current decision-making support systems, which are increasingly being used to interpret urban growth and development from a multi-dimensional perspective, such as a multi-criteria one. Individuals in charge of administering and governing a territory will gain from artificial intelligence techniques because they will be able to test resilience and responsibility in decision-making circumstances while also responding fast and spontaneously to community requirements.

rayyan-210783962,Flood vulnerability assessment in rural and urban informal settlements: case study of Karonga District and Lilongwe City in Malawi,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract Flood vulnerability assessment (FVA) informs the disaster risk reduction and preparedness process in both rural and urban areas. However, many flood-vulnerable regions like Malawi still lack FVA supporting frameworks in all phases (pre-trans-post disaster). Partly, this is attributed to lack of the evidence-based studies to inform the processes. This study was therefore aimed at assessing households’ flood vulnerability (HFV) in rural and urban informal areas of Malawi, using case studies of Traditional Authority (T/A) Kilupula of Karonga District (KD) and Mtandire Ward in Lilongwe City (LC). A household survey was used to collect data from a sample of 545 household participants. Vulnerability was explored through a combination of underlying vulnerability factors (UVFs)-physical-social-economic-environmental and cultural with vulnerability components (VCs)-exposure-susceptibility and resilience. The UVFs and VCs were agglomerated using binomial multiple logit regression model. Variance inflation factor (VIF) was used to check the multicollinearity of variables in the regression model. HFV was determined based on the flood vulnerability index (FVI). The data were analysed using Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA), artificial neural network (ANN) and STATA. The results reveal a total average score of high vulnerability (0.62) and moderate vulnerability (0.52) on MCA in T/A Kilupula of Karonga District and Mtandire Ward of Lilongwe City respectively. The FVI revealed very high vulnerability on enviroexposure factors (EEFs) ( $$0.9$$ <mml:math xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""> <mml:mrow> <mml:mn>0.9</mml:mn> </mml:mrow> </mml:math> ) in LC and $$(0.8$$ <mml:math xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""> <mml:mrow> <mml:mo>(</mml:mo> <mml:mn>0.8</mml:mn> </mml:mrow> </mml:math> ) in KD, followed by ecoresilience factors (ERFs) (0.8) in KD and $$(0.6$$ <mml:math xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""> <mml:mrow> <mml:mo>(</mml:mo> <mml:mn>0.6</mml:mn> </mml:mrow> </mml:math> ) in LC and physioexposure factors (PEFs) ( $$0.5)$$ <mml:math xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""> <mml:mrow> <mml:mn>0.5</mml:mn> <mml:mo>)</mml:mo> </mml:mrow> </mml:math> in LC besides 0.6 in KD for the combined UVFs and VCs. The study concludes that the determinants of households’ flood vulnerability are place settlement, low-risk knowledge, communication accessibility, lack of early warning systems, and limited access to income of household heads. The study recommends that an FVA framework should be applied to strengthen the political, legal, social, and economic responsibilities of government for building the resilience of communities and supporting planning and decision-making processes in flood risk management.","",https://doi.org/10.1007/s11069-024-06601-5,"",,

Against this background, we developed a Random Forest (RF) model by means of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) to examine the contributions of various impact features in regulating land surface temperature (LST) in the study area of Beijing, China. Multiple data sources were investigated, including LST, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), land cover, elevation, tree height, and building height. A grid of the study area (inner and outer cities), composed of 3416 boxes, 3x3 km, was used to extract mean values of impact features. RF outperformed the Multiple Linear Regression model (R2 of 0.89 vs 0.83) in predicting LST, demonstrating complex non-linear relationships between LST and impact features. By applying the eXplainable Artificial Intelligence method, our results suggest that the major impact features of LST in Beijing were elevation (44.19%), compactness of impervious surface (17.27%), NDVI (11.12%), proportion of impervious surface area (8.04%), and tree height (3.83%). The non-linear relationship between LST and impact features highlights the need for systematic planning of urban landscapes.

rayyan-210783974,The Pivotal Role of Libraries in Sustainable AI Development,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) has gained exceptional public and media coverage since the launch of the ChatGPT platform, a generative conversational intelligence, in November 2022. Nevertheless, AI is already an integral part of our digital daily lives, as we navigate through social networks, use our GPS, or consult recommendations on e-commerce websites. Due to its pervasive influence across all sectors of our societies, AI is gradually becoming a pivotal subject in terms of regulation, societal direction, and legislation. As early as 2021, UNESCO published a report presenting avenues for ethical considerations in AI. In June 2023, the European Union also established a regulatory framework outlining requirements and obligations for AI usage. As a digital manifestation and given the ""new ways in which its use influences human thinking, interaction and decision-making and affects education, human, social and natural sciences, culture, and communication and information"" (UNESCO. General Conference, 41st, 2021), public libraries have a role to play in enabling residents within their communities to grasp this technology. Their role is all the more significant as AI generates concerns and distrust (Gillath et al., 2021) among populations when ""libraries also continue to enjoy a high level of trust and appreciation in most of their communities"" (Arlitsch \&amp; Newell, 2017). Understanding AI thus constitutes a new cornerstone for accessing the necessary information to advance sustainable development, as outlined in the Lyon Declaration (2014). Moreover, comprehension of AI aligns with the ethical concerns articulated by UNESCO in terms of explainability and transparency and aligns with several Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the 2030 Agenda. These goals include quality education (4), industry, innovation and infrastructure (9), reduced inequalities (10), sustainable cities and communities (11), as well as responsible consumption and production (12). The role of public libraries in advancing the goals of the 2030 Agenda is beyond dispute (IFLA, 2016), and various digital literacies are already integral to their actions. As AI is predominantly developed by global economic giants and permeates all of our practices, ""Shouldn’t [libraries] be the bastions of information literacy and information privacy in an AI world?"" (Cox et al., 2018). Thus, to what extent can public libraries take on this subject to promote and offer relevant literacy? For this study, we will conduct a cross-analysis among three European countries—Spain, France, and Italy—to provide insights into the diverse ways in which AI influences professional practices. Through a literature review and semi-structured interviews, the objective is to delineate the challenges of Artificial Intelligence within the framework of the Agenda 2030 program. Subsequently, we will delve into the specificity of AI Literacy in comparison to Information Literacy, a practice already adopted by libraries. Finally, we will analyze the current and prospective role of AI in libraries to propose avenues for implementing concrete actions.","",https://doi.org/10.5206/cjils-rcsib.v47i2.17699,"",,

Traditionally, governments heavily depend on field survey methods to monitor the urban villages, which however are time-consuming, labor-intensive, and possibly delayed. Thanks to widely available and timely updated satellite images, recent studies develop computer vision techniques to detect urban villages efficiently. However, existing studies either focus on simple urban village image classification or fail to provide accurate boundary information. To accurately identify urban village boundaries from satellite images, we harness the power of the vision foundation model and adapt the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to urban village segmentation, named UV-SAM. Specifically, UV-SAM first leverages a small-sized semantic segmentation model to produce mixed prompts for urban villages, including mask, bounding box, and image representations, which are then fed into SAM for fine-grained boundary identification. Extensive experimental results on two datasets in China demonstrate that UV-SAM outperforms existing baselines, and identification results over multiple years show that both the number and area of urban villages are decreasing over time, providing deeper insights into the development trends of urban villages and sheds light on the vision foundation models for sustainable cities.

rayyan-210784002,Scenario-based Assessment of Land Use Change on Air Quality,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"In recent decades, growing urbanization and rapid land use changes have been important components of current development, affecting environmental dynamics, particularly air quality. Over 80% of city people may be exposed to levels of pollution that exceed WHO standards (WHO 2016). Previous research focused solely on the relationship between built-up space and particulate matter (PM), with no concern for future scenarios. This study explores the potential impact of land use change on air quality using a detailed scenario-based technique. The air pollutant data for 2022 was principally gathered from five distinct land uses, whereas previous years (2010 to 2021) were received from the Central Pollution Control Board. In a supervised classification technique, a Maximum Likelihood Classifier is utilized to analyze the LULC of 2010, 2016, and 2022 in Kharagpur, a rising industrial town and the fourth-largest city in West Bengal. The analysis shows a strong 20.62 percent rise in urban areas, particularly in the eastern region, from 2010 to 2022, comprising residential, commercial, and industrial zones. Between 2010 and 2022, there is an 11.23 percent loss in vegetative areas, a 9.29 percent decrease in agricultural land, and a 0.10 percent decrease in aquatic bodies. Further spatiotemporal analysis reveals that areas with low urban density had the lowest amounts of air pollution, with an overall Air Quality Index (AQI) in the ""excellent"" range (0-50). Industrial land use contributes 74.37 percent to air pollution, followed by densely populated urban regions, which have a 47.62 percent higher AQI than low-density zones. Furthermore, the vehicular corridor has a 33.49 percent higher AQI than low-density places. According to the data, the most significant pollutants leading to AQI variance are PM2.5 and PM10. A correlation study emphasizes the effect of land use changes on air quality since PM10 was followed by overall AQI is positively related to built-up areas and negatively related to vegetation and water bodies. It suggests that fast urbanization may damage air quality, but vegetation and waterbodies might improve air quality and lower AQI. Polluted air has a negative impact on human health, agricultural production, and numerous ecosystems, putting future urban growth at risk. It is therefore critical to assess future land use changes in order to predict future air quality settings and take preventive efforts to mitigate air pollution. To compare future air quality settings to a baseline, two scenarios for LULC prediction are examined: business as usual (BUA) and sustainable development (SD). These scenarios can help determine future urban development paths, as well as land use planning and policy-level action to improve air quality.

rayyan-210784010,Does the Innovative City Pilot Policy Improve Urban Resilience? Evidence from China,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"The assessment of the relationship between the innovative city pilot policy (ICPP) and urban resilience is crucial for enhancing cities’ ability to foresee, endure, and recover from various disruptive events. Despite the widespread implementation of the ICPP in China, it remains uncertain if this strategy will contribute to the development of urban resilience. Starting with data collected from 245 prefecture-level cities in China from 2004 to 2020, this paper initially evaluates the causal effect of the policy intervention using the difference-in-differences (DID) model and the propensity score matching-difference-in-differences (PSM-DID) method. A multi-dimensional urban resilience measurement index and a mediating effect model were constructed. The empirical results show that (1) the ICPP has a significant effect on urban resilience, which remains in force after a series of robustness tests, such as a placebo test and difference-in-differences machine learning (DML) approach; (2) regional R&amp;D investment, technological talent attraction, green innovation capability enhancement, and information infrastructure development are identified as the mediating variable for the ICPP’s impact on urban resilience dimensions; and (3) heterogeneity study results show that the ICPP has a significantly greater impact on medium-sized cities, attributed to their capacity to enhance the resilience of cities with more growing space. Furthermore, cities with lower economic agglomeration saw a greater increase in urban resilience due to the ICPP. Accordingly, it is recommended to prioritize the allocation of innovative resources to non-coastal regions, cities with low economic agglomeration, and medium-sized cities. This study provides crucial recommendations for the enlargement of the ICPP’s scale and coordinated progress of China’s urban resilience.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/su16229985,"",,
rayyan-210784011,The post-urbanization of Tokyo : its spatio temporal geography and governance,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"The urbanization of the global population could lead human societies to both declining and aging populations. This is because mature urban societies tend to provide urban dwellers, especially females, with better educational and work opportunities, reproductive health services, and freedom of life planning, which could result in a considerable decrease in national fertility rates. Under such societal improvements, 26–33 out of 48 global megacities, large urban regions with populations of over 10 million, will be situated in countries whose national population is projected to decrease by 20–50% by 2100. Amid such a substantial and sustained national population shrinkage, even megacities will not be free from urban shrinkage. In other words, mature urban societies will shift to the phase of ‘after’ urbanization—post-urbanization. Considering the rather realistic scenarios of post-urbanization, it will increasingly become a significant task for urban scholars and urban policymakers to explore and understand how the decline of highly urbanized societies will potentially change mature urban societies and how they are governed. Yet, the field of urban studies remains underdeveloped in terms of both academic and policy attention and foundational empirical research on post-urbanization. This thesis seeks to address this gap. Specifically, its overarching aim is to envisage what post- urbanization could bring to urban societies in the 21st century and propose policy propositions for future scholars and policymakers. To achieve the given aim, this thesis, as one of the initial scientific research efforts, explored the post-urbanization of the Tokyo Capital Region, the world’s largest megacity projected to become the first declining megacity by 2030, both in theoretical and empirical terms. In the theoretical exploration, relying on and revising existing relevant theories, this thesis discusses how demographic factors will increasingly play a constitutive role in urbanization and urban governance during a phase of constant and total population loss. In the empirical exploration, following a mixed-method research design integrating various methods— interviews, text-mining, spatial explorative analysis, and machine learning, the thesis yielded three articles analyzing the changing patterns of urbanization and urban governance of Tokyo. The first article using machine learning captured how the spatiotemporal socio- demography in Tokyo has been transforming into a complex heterogeneous landscape of (re)urbanization, (post)suburbanization, and urban shrinkage, illustrating that the spatial distribution of demographic resources increasingly becomes uneven within the megacity region. The result suggests that as post- urbanization progresses, inter-municipal disparities in demographic prosperity will increase, hindering municipalities from forming metropolitan governance. The second article drawing on interviews and quantitative spatiotemporal explorative analyses revealed that in the shrinking suburbia of Tokyo, demographic factors, through changing policymakers’ perspectives, have been influencing the mode of urban governance and resulting policies. While the empirical findings confirmed that forming a shrinkage-preemptive mode of metropolitan governance is possible, reinforcing both vertical and horizontal coordination across public authorities will be essential to promote it. The third article using a text-mining technique supports the existing arguments that bundles of locational preference among re-urbanizing socio-demographic groups are crucial to explain urban regrowth. For urban policymakers, this suggests strategic bundling of different urban features—physical structure, urban amenities, and place images—will be crucial to effectively attracting new residents. Even for policymakers in prosperous localities, to maintain demographic prosperity, it will remain important to monitor the changing metropolitan landscape of locational preferences to strategically adjust their bundles of urban features. Based on the given theoretical discussions and empirical insights, the thesis concludes that post-urbanization will bring a complex and heterogeneous post- urban landscape with uneven demographic prosperity where conventional growth-based urban governance and policies will be increasingly ineffective, and cooperative metropolitan governance will be essential to manage post-urban challenges. Yet, simultaneously, the study argues that the uneven distribution of demographic wealth per se, inducing inter-municipal competition, will increasingly hinder the localities in the megacity from realizing such metropolitan governance. Reflecting on these insights, the study formulated four policy propositions that are primarily for Tokyo but can potentially apply to future post-urban megacities. First, national and prefectural governments need to actively form institutional settings that enable and encourage megacity municipalities to coordinate different counter-shrinkage policies with their neighbors. Second, policymakers, together with relevant non-public stakeholders, need to form a policy-driven coalition to cooperatively manage and maintain inter-municipal physical and/or social infrastructures that are essential for maintaining their demographic prosperity. Third, policymakers, particularly those in the shrinking suburbs of the megacity, should strategically implement region-wide place branding to strengthen the region's socio-economic autonomy, retain current residents, and actively attract new ones, while also fostering inter-municipal governance. Finally, as actors—both public and non-public—largely determine the mode of governance and resulting policies for post-urban challenges, whether cities can realize the given three propositions and thus maintain and attract demographic wealth will depend heavily on what kind of people live and work in the city. Hence, effective post-urban governance, although this sounds pessimistic, is not something all post-urban localities can achieve. This implies that policymakers need to embrace the reality that in post-urban societies, some cities without the right people at the right moment will need a lot of effort to avoid their demise. After all, in post-urban societies where people are the underlying wealth of prosperity, people do matter.","",https://doi.org/10.24834/isbn.9789178775453,"",,

rayyan-210784015,Assessing the Effects of Electric Vehicle Adoption on Urban Energy Structure Transition: A Geospatial Machine Learning Study in Beijing,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Electric vehicles (EVs) have been proposed as a key solution for decarbonizing urban transportation and addressing climate change. As the use of EVs increases in cities worldwide, it may lead to significant transformation in urban development, including changes in the electrical system and people's travel behavior, such as charging preferences and choices of where to live and work. Some questions arise, will the rise of EVs lead to more suburbanization or drive people towards a more compact urban form? Additionally, how can the relationship between EV users' residential locations and new energy infrastructure be best coordinated? A study in the rapidly growing metropolis of Beijing aims to address these questions by combining geo-spatial big data analysis, machine learning, and theories of urban development to understand the relationship between EV users' residential locations and new energy infrastructure. A novel data mining strategy was proposed to identify actual EV users based on location data from smartphones. By analyzing observation data of EV users, the study applies the Gradient Boost Decision Tree model to examine the nonlinear associations between the spatial distribution of EV residents and neighborhood attributes such as employment density, GDP, land use mix, public charging accessibility, building areas, access to public transit, and suburbanization. The results indicate that a higher percentage of EV users prefer to live in areas that are neither too far away from the city center nor too close to it, particularly the threshold effects show that they are concentrated in areas where it has a 10 km distance from the city center. Additionally, the study found that most public charging activities tend to occur within 1.5 km from home, suggesting an optimal threshold for public charging station deployment. The findings of this study can help inform energy management and infrastructure planning at the local, regional, and national levels to promote sustainable urbanization and smarter energy planning in policy-making.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu23-17241,"",,

Employing a comprehensive analysis of Landsat imagery spanning 1984 to 2023, this study elucidates the shifting trends in LULC classes, their correlations with urban temperature dynamics, and their potential implications for the urban environment. The accuracy of LULC classification was established using the CART method, with an overall classification accuracy exceeding 90% for various years. A remarkable rise in built-up areas, coupled with corresponding drops in bare land and vegetation cover, underscores the need for rapid urbanization. Correlation analyses revealed intricate connections among population density, slope, spectral indices (NDVI and NDBI), and urban thermal dynamics. Predictive modeling employing the CA-ANN methodology projected future LULC changes up to 2033 and 2050. The model demonstrated strong predictive accuracy, as verified through QGIS validation, and projected a notable surge in urban areas along with reductions in bare land and vegetation coverage. This forecast highlights the necessity for well-balanced urban expansion policies to reduce the potential negative ecological and health effects.

rayyan-210784036,Building Height Estimation at 10m across multiple countries using Sentinel Time-Series,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"With the rapid shift of urban population to cities, urbanization monitoring has become essential to ensure sustainable development. In the last decade, 2D urban monitoring such as building footprint extraction has received considerable attention resulting in multiple high and low-resolution products. But despite being the essential component of urbanization, the vertical dimension (height) has not been studied at a large scale. Accurate estimation of building height plays an important role in urban planning, as it is correlated with energy consumption, population, transportation, city planning, urban climate and many other monitoring and planning required for sustainable development. Airborne LiDAR or high-resolution orthophotos can be used for accurate building height estimation but for large-scale monitoring applications, the data collection itself is extremely expensive. With a compromise of resolution, Earth observation data, especially free-of-cost data can be used for large-scale monitoring. Existing large-scale building height estimation methods operate at low resolution (1km to 100m). A few of the recent studies improved the resolution to 10m while operating in a few cities to few states of the country. In this study, we estimate building heights across four countries. We propose a DL model that operates on a time series of Sentinel-1 SAR and Sentinel-2 MSI data and estimates building height at 10m spatial resolution. Our model estimates building height with 1.89m RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) surpassing the best score of 3.73m reported in previous studies.&amp;#160; To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we tested it on data from four countries and compared it with a baseline and four recent DL networks. We evaluate the impact of time series input and individual input modality i.e., SAR and optical data on the performance of the proposed model. The model is also tested for generalizability. Furthermore, the predicted building heights are downsampled and compared with GHSL-Built-H R2023A, a state-of-the-art product at 100m spatial resolution. The results show an improvement of 0.3m RMSE.

However, numerous barriers hinder the successful implementation of smart city initiatives, particularly in the context of Dhaka, Bangladesh. Using the DEMATEL (Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory) approach, this study aims to investigate the challenges to the development of smart cities in Dhaka, which offers a complete knowledge of the interdependencies among the barriers. The research design employs a mixed-methods approach, combining expert interviews and quantitative analysis. While a structured questionnaire is used to gather quantitative data for the DEMATEL analysis, expert interviews are conducted to gather qualitative information on the challenges faced in the improvement of smart cities. To assess the cause-and-effect connections and the relative significance of the barriers, the DEMATEL technique is applied. Thematic analysis is used to identify and categorize the important barriers. The findings reveal several barriers, including inadequate infrastructure, lack of stakeholder collaboration, limited awareness and understanding, financial constraints, and policy gaps. The DEMATEL analysis highlights the interrelationships among these barriers, identifying the key barriers that have the most significant influence on impeding smart city development in Dhaka.

rayyan-210784047,Performing Sentiment Analysis Using Natural Language Models for Urban Policymaking: An analysis of Twitter Data in Brussels,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract Objectives Mobility is a core challenge to transition towards sustainability. Cities are, therefore, rethinking their mobility to reduce negative externalities such as (greenhouse) gas emissions or congestion. When trying to implement sustainable urban mobility plans, there is often resistance from citizens. This can indicate a disconnect between the public and policymakers due to a lack of participation, coupled with the fact that current data-collection methods often used (such as travel surveys) are limited in scope. Advances in big data analysis and user-generated content provide opportunities to gain deeper insights into citizens' perceptions of mobility policy changes. This paper explores how sentiment analysis through deep learning can be used in transport planning. Materials and Methods In this research, we analyse the sentiments of citizens towards recent changes in mobility policy in Brussels, Belgium, through Twitter data. We analyse 1998 tweets about changing mobility policy in Brussels between July 18th, 2019 (forming of the last Brussels regional government), and December 31st, 2022 (starting date of the analyses). For our analysis, we employ two pre-trained language models: XLM-T and GPT4 . Results Our results show that the sentiment with regard to the new mobility interventions is, as reflected by Twitter posts, not overwhelmingly negative. Furthermore, we find that the performance scores of XLM-T when no domain-specific fine-tuning has occurred (zero-shot evaluation) is fairly low (0.48). Once the model is trained on our domain-specific data, it reaches an accuracy of 0.67. When using GPT4 , the model reaches an accuracy of 0.66. Additionally, GPT4 seems better suited at identifying mismatched tweets, i.e. tweets using vocabulary that has a different sentiment than the one the tweets expresses (e.g., sarcasm). This might indicate that large language models might be better suited to obtain implicit sentiments expressed in a text. Conclusions From a machine learning perspective, our experiments highlight the difficulty of recognising contextual sentiment (in this case, a sentiment towards changes in mobility policies), which may differ from the sentiment reflected in the vocabulary used. This is especially important if these two sentiments do not correspond, a problem both models struggled with. Additionally, we show that GPT4 can provide additional information when performing sentiment analysis by prompting it to attribute scores to texts. This paper opens new perspectives on understanding and addressing public sentiment in urban mobility policies. The advancements in language models, and the effective integration of user-generated content, can provide policymakers with a more comprehensive understanding of public sentiment, facilitating the implementation of certain policies.

Building upon the two different sources of images—(1) participatory sensing obtained from mobile devices; and (2) large-scale publicly available street-level visual dataset—we first detect the drainage infrastructure in cities and then estimate their geographic location and as-is condition information through deep learning architecture. The identified spatio-temporal information is then fetched into the associated virtual replica toward a digital twin modeling, and finally the associated risk is analyzed.

However, the distribution of street greenery is imbalanced. Therefore, to explore the differences in street greening levels within urban cities, we crawled streetscape data using the Internet to assess the spatial distribution patterns of urban street GVI using deep learning and spatial autocorrelation, and combined 11 surrounding environmental features with multi-source geographic data to further analyze the key factors influencing the spatial variation of block GVI using ordinary least squares (OLS), geographically weighted regression (GWR) models, and multi-scale geographically weighted regression (MGWR) models. The results show that the mean value of GVI in Fuzhou City is low (23.08%), with large differences among neighborhoods and a significant spatial autocorrelation. Among the regression models, MGWR has the best fit with an R2 of 0.702, where the variables of NDVI, house price, accessibility of water bodies and parks, and the proportion of built-up land have a greater impact on GVI, and the factors do not have the same spatial effect size.

The study makes a concerted effort to unravel the complex interplay between various spatial, quantitative, and qualitative attributes of vegetation, aiming to comprehend its pivotal role in mitigating urban heat risks within urban environments. The UHI risk is related to land surface temperature (LST). The study models UHI risk in twelve American cities in diverse K&amp;#246;ppen-Geiger Climate zones spanning the contiguous USA. To address this, the Integrated Modelling approach by the ARtificial Intelligence for Environment &amp;amp; Sustainability (ARIES) initiative has been adopted in the study. This approach based on FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) principles is accessible at https://aries.integratedmodelling.org/. Utilizing the k.LAB software with semantic reasoning our modeling approach assesses the UHI risk. It maps the spatial distribution of UHI considering hotspots of anthropogenic heat, vegetation, land cover, and land surface temperature. UHI risk is assessed at a resolution of 30 meters alongside census tract-level data using an ordered weighted approach. The study found variations in the relationship between greenness, as indicated by the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and Land Surface Temperature (LST) across 12 different cities. The findings highlight the cooling effect of the water bodies, especially in areas near the port and green spaces. Linear parks such as roadside tree plantations typically feature uniform tree species and often lack smaller trees and shrubs, making them susceptible to heat infiltration from surrounding areas and resulting in a lesser overall temperature reduction. It identifies at least 30 percent of census tracts across 12 cities necessitate urban greening intervention.

Yet, our current understanding of the urban subsurface is limited by our ability to image its structure and temporal variations at high resolution using classical geophysical approaches. Recently, the application of conventional ambient noise interferometry analysis to dynamic strain data recorded using Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) deployed on unused telecommunication fiber-optic cables (dark fibers) has emerged as an attractive alternative for cost-efficient, regional scale (10&amp;#8217;s of km) seismic imaging and monitoring at high spatial and temporal resolution. Still, its application to urban environments remains vastly underutilized. One of the most significant hurdles is the lack of adequate and efficient data exploration and processing tools to address and harness the unique challenges associated with DAS-based urban seismic noise recordings, which include the complexity of the noise field, unconventional array geometries and non-uniform coupling conditions, and increasingly massive data volumes. The InDySE project (Interrogating the Dynamic Shallow Earth) aims at addressing these challenges to develop and validate the next-generation of subsurface imaging and monitoring platforms in urban areas based on the combination of existing fiber-optic networks and high-frequency infrastructure noise. The project comprises (1) developing high-performance computational tools, advanced processing workflows and machine learning approaches for efficient data exploration, selection and processing using existing datasets, (2) field experiments in target areas to retrieve high-resolution velocity models and monitor changes in seismic velocities, (3) integrating the resultant high-resolution seismic models with complementary datasets such as deformation maps derived from InSAR measurements. One of the selected study areas is the highly populated metropolitan area of Istanbul (Turkey), where understanding the structure, properties and dynamics of the shallow subsurface at high-resolution is critical for evaluating geohazard exposure.

  Based on Public Participation",,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"This study explores the application of Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) technology in urban planning and design, with a particular focus on its impact on placemaking and public participation. By utilizing natural language pro-cessing and image generation models such as Stable Diffusion, AIGC enables efficient transformation from textual descriptions to visual representations, advancing the visualization of urban spatial experiences. The research examines the evolving role of designers in participatory planning processes, specifically how AIGC facilitates their transition from traditional creators to collaborators and facilitators, and the implications of this shift on the effectiveness of public engagement. Through experimental evaluation, the study assesses the de-sign quality of urban pocket gardens generated under varying levels of designer involvement, analyzing the influence of de-signers on the aesthetic quality and contextual relevance of AIGC outputs. The findings reveal that designers significantly improve the quality of AIGC-generated designs by providing guidance and structural frameworks, highlighting the substantial potential of human-AI collaboration in urban design. This research offers valuable insights into future collaborative approaches between planners and AIGC technologies, aiming to integrate technological advancements with professional practice to foster sustainable urban development.","",https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2411.17194,"",,
rayyan-210784130,Fine-resolution estimation for urban surface water pollution susceptibility with multi-modal earth observation data,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract The sustainability and suitability of water resources are of great importance for maintaining urban populations. The landscapes and environment around urban waters have always been the main focus of maintaining water quality for sustainable water supplies. Early-stage field investigations recognized the influence of land use/land cover (LULC) on water quality. To extend the research scope in spatial and temporal dimensions, remote sensing techniques have been utilized to discover the relationships between LULC and water quality. However, these remote sensing datasets generally had a medium spatial resolution, making them unable to support the fine-detailed land classifications that are critical to explore the water quality in an urban area. Moreover, although more details regarding the land surface are available from the currently-generated high-resolution and very-high-resolution remote sensing images, this land surface information is too complex for the state-of-the-art deep learning approaches and benchmark datasets. This manuscript reports our efforts on developing a framework to explore the fine-resolution relationship between surface water pollution and LULC. To address the cost of computing time and limitations of well-labelled datasets, we employ a foundation model-enhanced approach for water extraction and water-surrounded LULC classification. We propose an estimator of surface water pollution susceptibility to main pollutants based on the surrounding LULCs. Selecting the Future City of Beijing as the study area, based on very-high-resolution remote sensing images, the experiment proved that our proposed approach could effectively map the susceptibility of surface water pollution caused by its surrounding land use and land cover. To our knowledge, the relationship of LULCs and water quality have not been investigated using 0.5 m spatial resolution data. We hope our work can provide a prospective fine-detailed water quality analysis in the community of water environment of remote sensing.","",https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/ad4a92,"",,

rayyan-210784137,Evaluation the Performance of Three Types of Two-Source Evapotranspiration Models in Urban Woodland Areas,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"The determination of the evapotranspiration (ET) and its components in urban woodlands is crucial to mitigate the urban heat island effect and improve sustainable urban development. However, accurately estimating ET in urban areas is more difficult and challenging due to the heterogeneity of the underlying surface and the impact of human activities. In this study, we compared the performance of three types of classic two-source ET models on urban woodlands in Shenzhen, China. The three ET models include a pure physical and process-based ET model (Shuttleworth–Wallace model), a semi-empirical and physical process-based ET model (FAO dual-Kc model), and a purely statistical and process-based ET model (deep neural network). The performance of the three models was validated using an eddy correlation and stable hydrogen and oxygen isotope observations. The verification results suggested that the Shuttleworth–Wallace model achieved the best performance in the ET simulation at main urban area site (coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.75). The FAO-56 dual Kc model performed best in the ET simulation at the suburb area site (R2 of 0.77). The deep neural network could better capture the nonlinear relationship between ET and various environmental variables and achieved the best simulation performance in both of the main urban and suburb sites (R2 of 0.73 for the main urban and suburb sites, respectively). A correlation analysis showed that the simulation of urban ET is most sensitive to temperature and least sensitive to wind speed. This study further analyzed the causes for the varying performance of the three classic ET models from the model mechanism. The results of the study are of great significance for urban temperature cooling and sustainable urban development.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/su15129826,"",,

The core of the paper is to build an innovation space system, which is developed around three key components: innovation elements, innovation networks and innovation bases. First, the definition of innovation space is investigated in detail, and the essence of innovation space is understood to ensure that the key elements in the innovation process can be accurately captured and analyzed in the follow-up research. Second, it is clear that Chengdu is a representative city in Sichuan Province. Through the research in this area, people can deeply understand the specific background and characteristics of urban innovation space system. Then, the innovation space system is constructed, which is supported by innovation elements, innovation networks and innovation bases. These three components are intertwined, which together constitute the key elements of urban innovation space. Furthermore, the Internet worm technology is integrated with the IoT technology, and the system is visually inspected with the help of AI. The application of IoT technology helps to realize the automation and information sharing of the system, while the use of AI provides a deep insight into the system structure and operation. Through this research process, people can fully understand the construction process of Chengdu innovation space system, and provide deeper insight and support for urban innovation through the application of IoT and AI technology. The results show that while Chengdu's entrepreneurship and innovation enterprises are dispersed throughout all of the city's districts and counties, the city's academic talent and the bulk of its higher education institutions are concentrated in the city's core. There are 275 entrepreneurship and innovation enterprises in the High-tech District of Chengdu, which is the most densely distributed area. An urban innovation space network is being built by eight distinct research and higher education establishments. As urban innovation spaces are being built, emphasis should be given to the regional aggregation features of talents, higher education and research institutions, as well as entrepreneurship and innovation business enterprises. The innovation space system based on Internet worm technology of the IoT shows excellent performance in real-time identification of innovation elements, network connection quality, sensor monitoring, AI visual monitoring and so on. The system performs well in real-time monitoring of new enterprises and projects, and the real-time recognition rate reaches 98 %. The communication quality of the innovation network is relatively stable, and the connection quality reaches 92 %. The accuracy of sensor status monitoring in the IoT is high, reaching 99 %. The coverage of AI vision monitoring system reaches 96 %, effectively monitoring the areas involved in innovative space systems.

rayyan-210784141,Research on Post-Use Evaluation of Community Green Space Rectification Based on a Multi-Dimensional Perception System: A Case Study of Jiayuan Sanli Community in Beijing,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Community green spaces (CGSs) constitute a crucial element of urban land use, playing a pivotal role in maintaining the stability of urban ecosystems and enhancing the overall quality of the urban environment. Through the post-occupancy evaluation (POE) of green spaces, we can gain insights into residents’ actual needs and usage habits, providing scientific evidence for the planning, design, and management of green spaces. This ensures that CGSs better meet residents’ needs and improve their quality of life. The POE of CGSs relies heavily on high-precision data support. However, the current POE system for CGSs faces challenges, such as limited data collection methods, incomplete indicator systems, and excessive manual involvement. To address these limitations in data collection, this study proposes a comprehensive, dynamically monitored, objective, and sustainable POE system for CGSs. This system incorporates a multi-dimensional perception system that integrates the Internet of Things (IoT) and sensors to collect data from various sources. It establishes an evaluation framework from the perspectives of policy guidance and usage needs for CGSs, utilizing neural network systems and artificial intelligence techniques to compute the evaluation results. Using the Jiayuan Sanli Community in Beijing as a case study, this paper demonstrates the feasibility of the proposed system. A comparison between the POE results obtained using the multi-dimensional perception technique and those obtained manually reveals an 87% improvement in the accuracy of the evaluation results based on the multi-dimensional perception system. This system bridges the gap between planning perspectives and user experiences, contributing significantly to future urban land planning and land policy formulation.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/land13050698,"",,
rayyan-210784143,Green Urban Equity: Analyzing the 3-30-300 Rule in UK Cities and Its Socioeconomic Implications,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Green spaces in cities have been demonstrated to offer multiple benefits to their inhabitants, including cleaner air, shade in sunny periods, and a place that contributes to mental well-being. In addition, trees in cities are home to several species of animals and work as a nature-based solution that can sequester CO2 and regulate water storage in urban ecosystems. The 3-30-300 rule space rule has been suggested as a strategy for city planners regarding urban forestry. This rule states that every resident&amp;#8217;s home or workplace should be close to at least three trees, every neighbourhood should have a 30% canopy cover, and every citizen should have access to a public green space within a 300 m radius. Following this rule guarantees that all citizens obtain all the benefits of urban vegetation; however, this is not the case for all areas, particularly those impoverished ones where access to green spaces is limited, further contributing to social inequality. This study delves into the implementation of this rule across major UK urban areas, employing a blend of remotely sensed imagery, census data, ordnance surveys and machine learning methods. Our findings offer vital insights for city planners, emphasizing the need for a strategic approach to urban green space distribution that fosters social equity and environmental sustainability.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu24-20833,"",,
rayyan-210784145,"Trees, society, and the path toward resilient ecosystems",,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Over 3 trillion trees occupy the Earth's land surface, mostly in tropical and subtropical forests. These trees provide vital ecosystem services, such as climate regulation, carbon sequestration, and habitat and food provision. Trees are also deeply interconnected with humans, offering social and cultural values. The interdependence between trees and humans underlines the urgency to understand and protect trees in both natural and urban ecosystems amid climate change and other environmental pressures, including deforestation, land degradation, and pollution. This virtual issue examines five critical themes of trees and forests and their societal impact. Over 3 trillion trees occupy the Earth's land surface, mostly in tropical and subtropical forests (~1.3 trillion) (Crowther et al., 2015). These trees provide vital ecosystem services, such as climate regulation, carbon sequestration, and habitat and food provision (Brockerhoff et al., 2017; Myers, 1997). Trees are also deeply interconnected with humans, offering social and cultural values (O'Brien, 2005). The interdependence between trees and humans underlines the urgency to understand and protect trees in both natural and urban ecosystems amid climate change and other environmental pressures, including deforestation, land degradation, and pollution (De Marco et al., 2022; Esperon-Rodriguez, Tjoelker, et al., 2022; Kumar et al., 2022; Lindner et al., 2010). This virtual issue examines five critical themes of trees and forests and their societal impact. Each theme provides insights into cultural significance, ecosystem contributions, resilience and restoration, and technological innovations in conservation. In 'Climate Resilience and Adaptive Strategies of Trees', researchers investigate how trees adapt to climate change through resilience and genetic diversity with studies on urban forest adaptation, genetic variation, and seasonal responses of tree species. 'Forest Restoration and Biodiversity Conservation' shows strategies that enhance biodiversity and climate mitigation with diverse reforestation practices. In 'Trees and Human Culture', the research explores the cultural value of trees, focusing on the historical and societal importance of native and commercial species and their role in local traditions and economies. The authors of work featured in 'Trees as Ecosystem Engineers' highlight how trees contribute to biodiversity and support livelihoods, with studies on societal perceptions, species interactions, and endemic conservation efforts. Lastly, 'Technological Advances in Forest Monitoring and Conservation' delves into tools like UAVs and genetic analyses that aid in monitoring and preserving forests. Together, these themes offer a comprehensive view of trees' essential roles across ecosystems, human culture, and emerging conservation efforts. As a response to climate change and urbanization, researchers highlight the need to enhance urban forest resilience. Urban forests, essential for decreasing urban heat and improving air quality and human well-being (Keeler et al., 2019), face risks from climate-induced stress. To secure the provision of these benefits to urban residents, Esperon-Rodriguez, Rymer, et al. (2022) emphasize the importance of selecting tree species suited to the projected climate conditions in cities along with other desirable characteristics, such as aesthetic value and biodiversity support. By assessing the risks to heat, drought, and pest outbreaks, urban planners can make informed decisions to increase the longevity of urban trees and secure the services they provide (Esperon-Rodriguez, Rymer, et al., 2022). Urban environments present unique challenges and opportunities for tree resilience. Sjöman et al. (2024) examined how genetic diversity within tree species (i.e., intraspecific variation) supports resilience to urban stresses, such as pollution and limited water availability. The authors suggest that by focusing on resilient tree varieties, urban forestry initiatives can improve biodiversity and ecosystem function within cities, fostering healthier urban landscapes that also contribute to climate resilience. Species, however, respond differently to local environmental conditions. For example, Goessen et al. (2022) explored how tree species have diverse adaptations driven by geographic conditions. Their study focused on Populus tremuloides, or Quaking aspen, a species native to North America, has developed divergent strategies in response to local environmental constraints, reflecting the role of genetic diversity in resilience. In Japan, Miyawaki-Kuwakado et al. (2024) investigated how warming temperatures affect the timing of seasonal events like bud dormancy. Their research on the iconic Yoshino cherry tree (Cerasus × yedoensis) showed that climate change may lead to mistimed flowering. Such shifts threaten species reliant on specific climatic triggers, raising concerns about the long-term viability of temperature-sensitive species in changing climates. Importantly, these changes can also have socio-economic disruptions, as the blossoming of cherries is an important tourism resource (Murata et al., 2012). Similar results were found in the Singapore Botanic Gardens, where Ho et al. (2024) conducted a long-term assessment of changes in leafing behavior of tropical trees in response to climate change. They found that tropical trees can adjust their leafing behavior over extended periods, showcasing their adaptive capacity. By focusing on adaptive capacity, genetic diversity, and optimal species selection, this research offers pathways to enhance forest resilience and sustain the ecological and social benefits that trees provide. Forest restoration plays a critical role in climate change mitigation and biodiversity conservation as global efforts aim to reverse deforestation and land degradation (Bastin et al., 2019). Andres et al. (2023) sought to define the term ""biodiverse reforestation"" and explained why this matters for climate change mitigation and biodiversity. The authors emphasize the importance of integrating biodiversity goals into reforestation efforts. By prioritizing species diversity, reforestation projects can sequester carbon more effectively while supporting ecosystem functions and species. This represents a more resilient and sustainable approach to forest restoration. Importantly, the authors consider the potential for improving scientific approaches to biodiverse reforestation with First Nations perspectives. The co-benefits of Indigenous knowledge and values have been recognized as vital to climate adaptation (Nursey-Bray et al., 2022). In restoration, ensuring water efficiency in seedlings is crucial, especially under climate stress. Krishnan et al. (2023) examined how organic nitrogen can enhance water-use efficiency in tropical tree seedlings. They showed that nutrient addition allowed seedlings to establish more effectively under dry conditions, suggesting practical strategies for forest restoration projects in arid regions. This has important repercussions not only for restoration but also for food production. For example, in regions where food security and forest health are closely linked, selecting appropriate tree species is essential. A study in Burkina Faso, West Africa, by Vinceti et al. (2022) explored how tree species contribute to both ecological restoration and local nutrition. By including species that provide food, like fruit-bearing trees, reforestation initiatives in Burkina Faso can address both environmental and community needs, creating landscapes that support biodiversity while improving food security. Local and small-scale efforts, such as home gardens, also play a significant role in supporting biodiversity and for conservation. Offord and Zimmer (2024) studied how home gardeners help preserve the critically endangered Wollemi Pine (Wollemia nobilis). This species native to Australia was described as new to science in 1994 and is represented by fewer than 100 individuals (Trueman et al., 2007). By cultivating Wollemi Pine in private gardens, individuals contribute to broader conservation goals, ensuring genetic diversity and supporting efforts to reintroduce the species into its natural habitat (Offord & Zimmer, 2024). This approach highlights the value of community-based conservation in supporting endangered species and enhancing biodiversity. Trees and forests have profound cultural and economic value, reflecting centuries of human interaction and local knowledge (O'Brien, 2005). Recent research investigates the cultural, economic, and social significance of tree species, focusing on the importance of identity, naming, and preservation of species. Dunbar-Wallis et al. (2023) highlight the significance of preserving historic North American apple (Malus domestica) varieties. Their study showed how naming and identifying these apples maintain cultural heritage and biodiversity. North American apples represent historical practices and tastes, underscoring the importance of preserving these genetic resources as part of local identity and resilience. Notably, M. domestica is one of the most cultivated fruits worldwide (ranked fourth) with an average annual production of over 85 million tons globally (FAOSTAT, 2020). For the wild apple (Malus sylvestris), Ruhsam et al. (2023) took the challenge of accurately identifying the nursery stock sold in nurseries from the United Kingdom. Wild apple species are vital for genetic diversity and resilience, and ensuring authenticity in nursery stock is crucial for conservation. This research highlights the importance of preserving genetic integrity and maintaining access to wild species, which are valuable for both biodiversity and cultural heritage. Studying a culturally significant species, the barnī date palm variety, a local elite variety of al-'Ulā oasis in Saudi Arabia, Gros-Balthazard et al. (2023) found that this variety is not only an economic staple but also a cultural icon in the region. Through its name and cultivation, the barnī date palm represents a rich heritage that has sustained communities for generations, illustrating how plant varieties can embody place-based knowledge and cultural ties. In a similar study, Gurung et al. (2024) explored the cultural and medicinal significance of Buddleja asiatica, a shrub native to the East Indies. In the Pan-Himalayan region, this species is integral to local healthcare practices, providing essential medicinal benefits to communities. Its use reflects a traditional knowledge system and highlights the symbiotic relationship between people and native plant species, demonstrating the role of trees in supporting cultural identity and local health. Trees as ecosystem engineers (i.e., organisms responsible for the creation and maintenance of habitats; Jones et al., 1996) can change the abiotic context upon which biotic interactions depend (Byers et al., 2006). Thus, community livelihoods rely on identifying threats and benefits provided by trees. Tsvuura et al. (2023) explored gender perspectives on the perceived benefits and threats of tree restoration in South Africa. They explored how communities view trees as valuable contributors to their livelihoods, recognizing the critical role trees play in providing resources such as timber, fruit, and medicinal products. However, this study also highlights concerns regarding threats to these benefits, such as climate change, deforestation, and urbanization. These threats challenge the sustainability of the services that communities depend on, underscoring the need for strategies that secure tree resources while balancing conservation and economic needs (Sivakumar et al., 2024). In Yemen, Maděra et al. (2024) studied 11 endemic frankincense tree (Boswellia) taxa in the Socotra Archipelago. These species are culturally and economically valuable to local communities. However, frankincense trees are also threatened by overharvesting, habitat loss, and climate change, threatening local biodiversity and the communities reliant on them for livelihood. Maděra et al.'s study provides a detailed ecological assessment identifying regions at most risk and offers insights into conservation strategies that balance sustainable use with the preservation of genetic diversity. The conservation of frankincense trees is critical not only for the ecosystem but also for supporting traditional practices and economic stability for people in the region. As hosts for other species, trees can develop complex interactions, such as the relationship between strangler figs and their host trees, studied by Mo et al. (2024). Strangler figs start life on host trees, gradually growing and often overtaking the host tree's structure. While this interaction may seem parasitic, it can enhance urban green spaces by adding unique biodiversity and aesthetic value. This study suggests that, when managed properly, strangler figs can enrich urban ecosystems by creating microhabitats for multiple species, supporting urban biodiversity, and improving the resilience of green spaces (Mo et al., 2024). This research highlights the dual ecological and cultural significance of these trees in urban landscapes. Modern technologies like AI, UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles), and genetic tools are shaping a new era in the conservation, management, and monitoring of forests worldwide. By combining UAV surveys, genetic analysis, advanced forestry tools, and ground-based monitoring, researchers and managers can make informed decisions about forest conservation and sustainable use. These technologies not only improve our understanding of forest ecosystems but also facilitate enforcing regulations, planning conservation strategies, and adapting to climate change impacts on forests. In Madagascar, Williams (2024) used UAVs to monitor deforestation in real-time. Madagascar harbors a unique biodiversity, but this is threatened by illegal logging (Ralimanana et al., 2022). UAVs enable rapid, cost-effective detection of deforestation, offering precise data on forest loss and allowing authorities to respond promptly to illegal activities (Williams, 2024). In a global review of emerging tools to support sustainable forestry, Bunney et al. (2023) focused on protecting sandalwood species (a variety of species in the family Santalaceae), which are culturally and economically valuable and threatened by overharvesting. This review examined different methods, including DNA barcoding, to verify the species of harvested wood and remote sensing for forest monitoring. Together, these studies demonstrate the importance of combining drones, remote sensing, and genetic tools for comprehensive forest conservation strategies. The role of genomics in understanding the resilience of tree species was studied by Kong et al. (2023). Prosopis alba, native to arid environments, possesses genetic traits that allow it to withstand extreme drought and saline conditions. By mapping the genome of P. alba, Kong et al. demonstrated species adaptability, which can inform breeding programs aimed at enhancing the resilience of trees in regions facing water scarcity and climate stress. Genomic tools enable targeted conservation of tree species that are vital to ecosystem stability in extreme climates (Isabel et al., 2020). Finally, in a study using ground-based data, Anderson-Teixeira et al. (2024) showed that effective forest carbon inventories require precise measurements of carbon stocks. Technologies such as remote sensing paired with field data can provide reliable estimates. This approach enhances the accuracy of reporting forest carbon, helping countries meet their climate goals and track the effectiveness of conservation efforts. Collectively, these studies show the essential roles that trees play in both natural and urban environments, particularly in the face of climate change and environmental pressures. They reveal how trees adapt to climate changes, underscoring the importance of genetic diversity and adaptive strategies to strengthen climate-resilient forestry. This knowledge supports informed species selection and management to foster resilient forests that benefit both ecosystems and communities. A multi-faceted approach to forest restoration, one that incorporates ecological, cultural, and social factors, emerges as crucial for sustaining biodiversity while meeting community needs. These studies highlight trees as cultural symbols and economic resources, essential for preserving cultural identity and biodiversity. Trees also serve as ecosystem engineers, offering ecosystem services that support biodiversity, air quality, and water regulation, while facing significant threats from human impact. Notably, technological advancements and emerging tools are transforming forest conservation and monitoring, providing researchers with tools to better protect and manage forest ecosystems. Together, these studies provide insights and innovations toward more sustainable and resilient ecosystems that benefit both the environment and society. MER wrote this article.

In Yogyakarta City, urban development and an increase in population accompanied by a decrease and insufficiency in the proportion of UGS correlate with rising urban temperatures. Monitoring the availability of UGS can serve as a foundation for decision-making in managing the city's UGS. With advancements in technology and computing in the field of Computer Vision (CV), it's possible to recognize UGS from the geometric patterns of satellite images. This study proposes a vegetation segmentation method using satellite images and a Deep Learning (DL) method with the U-Net architecture to estimate the availability of UGS. Evaluation results show that the image dataset without preprocessing with the Red Green Blue (RGB) color channel gives an average Intersection over Union (IoU) of 80.74%. These results are better than data that underwent grayscaling and contrast stretching preprocessing. Based on a case study conducted in three sub-districts in the Yogyakarta region, the constructed U-Net model gave an average IoU evaluation of 60.88%. These results demonstrate the model's capability to provide a reference in calculating the UGS area at the sub-district level, which can then be utilized by the Yogyakarta City government to analyze the availability of UGS more efficiently.

The road surface prediction results have been matched and integrated with OpenStreetMap (OSM) road geometries. This study provides global data insights derived from maps and statistics about spatial distribution of Mapillary coverage and road pavedness on a continent and countries scale, with rural and urban distinction. This dataset expands the availability of global road surface information by over 3 million kilometers, now representing approximately 36% of the total length of the global road network. Most regions showed moderate to high paved road coverage (60-80%), but significant gaps were noted in specific areas of Africa and Asia. Urban areas tend to have near-complete paved coverage, while rural regions display more variability. Model validation against OSM surface data achieved strong performance, with F1 scores for paved roads between 91-97% across continents.

Yet the differences in land productivity degradation under various land management patterns (land sparing vs. land sharing) are poorly known. In this research, we used remote sensing data to develop a machine learning model for assessing the risk of land productivity degradation and interpreted the model using state‐of‐the‐art interpretable artificial intelligence techniques. In 2018, the risk level of land productivity degradation in the agricultural production space of the Yangtze River Delta urban agglomeration (YRD) was 0.230. More than half of the area was at low risk (68.19% of the area), mainly in mountainous and hilly areas. The degradation risk of the land sharing management pattern is lower than that of the land sparing pattern, but there are significant differences among provinces/municipalities. The four most influential factors for land productivity degradation in YRD were Normalized Vegetation Difference Index, nighttime light, elevation, and nitrogen deposition, which together explained 72.75% of the degradation risk. This study provides a methodological framework for land degradation governance in emerging urban agglomerations.

In Meherpur District, Bangladesh, limited research has integrated LULC mapping with predictive models, resulting in a gap in knowledge regarding future land use patterns in this fast-changing region. This study addresses that gap by analyzing LULC changes from 2000 to 2024 using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Geographic Information Systems (GIS), and the Cellular Automata (CA) model for predictive analysis. The study reveals significant LULC changes over the 24-year period, including an 18% decrease in vegetation cover, a 6% reduction in agricultural land, and a 4% increase in built-up areas. These trends align with global patterns of urban expansion, often at the expense of agricultural and natural land. Additionally, increases in fallow land (7%) and water bodies (8%) indicate changing land use driven by population growth and infrastructure development. The loss of vegetation, in particular, poses risks to biodiversity, climate regulation, and food security. An innovative aspect of this research is the use of the CA model with the MOLUSCE plugin in QGIS, enabling simulations of future LULC changes up to 2032. This predictive approach offers insights into the impacts of ongoing urbanization, unlike previous studies in Bangladesh that mainly focused on historical LULC changes. The study suggests several future research directions, including investigating the socio-economic drivers of LULC changes, expanding the geographic scope to neighboring regions, and incorporating advanced remote sensing and machine learning techniques to enhance the accuracy of predictions. In conclusion, this research fills a critical gap in LULC studies in Meherpur by combining historical analysis with predictive modeling, offering valuable insights for policymakers to guide sustainable land use planning amidst ongoing urbanization and agricultural development.","",https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-5275701/v1,"",,
rayyan-210784166,Multilevel Change of Urban Green Space and Spatiotemporal Heterogeneity Analysis of Driving Factors,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Analyzing the change trend of urban green space (UGS) and exploring related driving forces can provide scientific reference for sustainable development in rapidly urbanizing areas. However, the spatial and temporal driving mechanisms of the drivers on UGS patterns at different scales are still not deeply understood. Based on the GlobeLand30 land cover data, nighttime lighting data and spatial statistics from 2000 to 2020, this study analyzed the size, shape and diversity of UGS in Guangzhou at the urban level, gradient level and township level with multiple landscape indices. Diversity means the richness of UGS patch types. The selected indices include percent of landscape (PLAND), largest path index (LPI), landscape shape index (LSI), aggregation index (AI) and Shannon’s diversity index (SHDI). The spatiotemporal heterogeneity of the drivers was then explored using the spatiotemporal weighted regression (GTWR) method. Results showed the following: (1) During 2000−2020, the total amount of UGS in Guangzhou increased slightly and then decreased gradually. UGS was mainly transferred into artificial surfaces (lands modified by human activities). (2) The UGS landscape showed a non-linear trend along the urban–rural gradient and fluctuated more in the interval of 20–60% urbanization level. PLAND, LPI and AI decreased significantly in areas with higher levels of urbanization. LSI increased and SHDI decreased significantly in areas with lower levels of urbanization. At township level, the landscape indices showed significant spatial autocorrelation. They transformed from discrete changes at the edge and at the junction of the administrative district to large-scale aggregated change, especially in northern areas. (3) The size of UGSs was mainly influenced by natural factors and population density, but their shape and diversity were mainly influenced by socio-economic factors. More regular shapes of green patches were expected in higher urbanization areas. Population agglomeration positively influenced green space patterns in the northeastern and southern regions (Zengcheng, Conghua and Nansha). Meanwhile the negative influence of urban expansion on the green space pattern in the central and southern regions decreased over time. This study contributes to an in-depth understanding of how the key factors affect the different changes of UGS with time and space and provides methodological support for the long-term zoning planning and management of UGS.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/su16114762,"",,
rayyan-210784168,Transforming Post-Disaster Risk Management: A Comprehensive Framework for Digital Twinning with AI and Machine Learning,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Digital Twins (DT) are dynamic digital representations of physical entities ranging from individual systems to entire cities. They leverage real-time data to create accurate models and simulations, offering significant potential for post-disaster risk management (PRM) applications. However, the integration of DT into PRM is still in its infancy, with its full capabilities yet to be realized.This study introduces the Digital Post-Disaster Risk Management Twinning (DPRMT) paradigm, which aims to harness AI and ML within DT frameworks to reinforce the resilience of urban areas and communities in the face of disasters. A critical review of 335 research papers on DPRMT from reputable databases indicates that existing literature often fails to fully appreciate the dynamic and interconnected nature of disasters, typically relying on static historical data and neglecting important financial, social, and demographic factors in affected communities.We propose a tansformative DPRMT framework that encompasses six interconnected components. &amp;#8220;Entities at Risk&amp;#8221; identifies a variety of elements vulnerable during disasters, including human lives, buildings, critical infrastrucres, and social networks. &amp;#8220;Data collection and preparation&amp;#8221; employ various methods such as remote sensing, crowdsourcing, and social sensing to gather and prepare dynamic data for analysis. Data Processing leverages artificial intelligence and machine learning to validate, fuse, and analyze collected data, enhancing its accuracy and reliability. Digital Modeling encompasses diverse techniques like AI-based modeling, socio-economic modeling, and physical modeling to create computer-based representations of entities at risk, enabling in-depth analysis and prediction. Information Decoding involves comprehensive data and model analysis, integration, and visualization, delivering timely and actionable information to enhance decision-making and transparency. User Interaction and Application ensure effective communication between digital twin models and end-users through various technologies, facilitating real-time information delivery and stakeholder engagement in disaster response and recovery. This framework is designed to fill current gaps in traditional disaster recovery methods by integrating real-time, detailed, and data-driven modeling solutions, fostering improved decision-making in areas such as policy development, resilience assessment, casualty and hazard prediction, resource distribution, evacuation planning, scenario testing, and community involvement. &amp;#160;Despite the promise of ML in improving DT capabilities for PRM such as data validation, information extraction, predictive maintenance and anomaly detection, the results show that challenges remain, including the need for high-quality and diverse data, privacy concerns, and cost-effectiveness, particularly in less developed countries. The use of remote sensing technologies, such as satellites and drones, is presented as a viable solution to overcome these challenges. These technologies supply high-quality, detailed data on buildings, infrastructure, land cover changes, and post-disaster scenarios while addressing privacy and security concerns. Nonetheless, issues with model generalization persist, necessitating training on varied disaster contexts, managing large datasets, capturing the dynamic nature of disasters, and maintaining transparency in decision-making for practical real-time application. The limitations of current ML methods, especially their time-consuming nature and the need for frequent re-training in evolving disaster scenarios, may impede their seamless integration with DT frameworks. This highlights the need to develop more efficient and rapid ML and Deep Learning models specifically designed for the unique requirements of post-disaster recovery management.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu24-4202,"",,
rayyan-210784175,Pluvial Flooding Risk Mitigation: a machine learning approach for optimal management of an urban drainage system,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the variability of extreme rainfall events is increasing in many locations. The continuous expansion of urban areas makes urban flooding more common, thus increasing the need for improved management of drainage systems in large cities. Urban pluvial flooding (UPF) occurs when surface runoff cannot be efficiently conveyed into the drainage system, due to intense rainfall events exceeding the capacity of stormwater drainage systems, or due to inlets' poor maintenance which are often either partially or fully blocked. Many drainage systems may not be efficient due to outdated design approaches that do not consider these aspects. Therefore, there is a need to improve the design of structures and to prioritize risk adaptation and mitigation strategies to build resilient cities against the effects of pluvial flooding. During extreme rainfall events generating pluvial flooding, discharges exceeding the sewer system capacity are diverted by sewer overflows. For this reason, the objective of this work consists of defining a methodology to determine the optimal management strategy to mitigate sewer overflows using machine learning techniques. Here we simulate pluvial flooding within a large urban area by using the freely available Storm Water Management Model EPA-SWMM, based on a detailed reproduction of the geometric characteristics of a branch of the drainage network in a large city. By simulating the different propagation effects of synthetic hyetographs in the pipelines and artefacts, the dynamic operating conditions of the actual network are performed using machine learning techniques, by applying Python to the SWMM data model (PySWMM). The project, which is ongoing, thus aims at the optimal management of the combined overflow devices of a sewer system through their real time control during a flood event to mitigate pluvial flooding risk in urban areas.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu24-8516,"",,

This study uses mobile phone location data at the Census Block Group level and explainable machine learning methods to examine the relationships between various factors and human mobility in ten Metropolitan Statistical Areas to uncover how different factors influenced mobility disparities. Our key findings show significant reductions in all mobility indices during the summer of 2020 compared to 2019, mainly due to stay‐at‐home orders, business closures, and health concerns. Median household income was a consistent positive driver of mobility, while the minority rate negatively impacted movement, exacerbating existing inequalities. Remote work significantly affected full‐time and part‐time job mobility. These findings highlight the need for fair and resilient mobility policies that consider decentralized commuting, flexible work models, and sustainable transportation. These insights can help policymakers and urban planners address inequalities, support economic recovery, and build inclusive urban environments.","",https://doi.org/10.1111/tgis.13271,"",,

Authorities in large or rapid growth cities had added responsibilities for managing UGS visitation levels at notable properties with popular surrounding points of interest (POI). Using mobile device location data for 120 major urban parks in 20 large U.S. cities, we examined how UGS usage is impacted by both longer-term citywide growth, as well as individual parks’ surroundings and internal characteristics. In four steps, we fit a mixed model adjusted for weather, the annual fluctuation in visitors, selection of adjustment variables and review of model fit through focused applications of the machine learning Akaike Information Criteria and techniques.

The development of predictive models via machine learning to explore the underlying mechanisms of this association, as well as the formulation of intervention policies and planning strategies, has emerged as a pivotal area of research. A cross-sectional dataset of hospital admissions for CHD over the course of a year from a hospital in Dalian City, China, was assembled and matched with multi-source built environment data via residential addresses. This study evaluates five machine learning models, including decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), multi-layer perceptron (MLP), and support vector machine (SVM), and compares them with multiple linear regression models. The results show that DT, RF, and XGBoost exhibit superior predictive capabilities, with all R2 values exceeding 0.70. The DT model performed the best, with an R2 value of 0.818, and the best performance was based on metrics such as MAE and MSE. Additionally, using explainable AI techniques, this study reveals the contribution of different built environment factors to CHD and identifies the significant factors influencing CHD in cold regions, ranked as age, Digital Elevation Model (DEM), house price (HP), sky view factor (SVF), and interaction factors. Stratified analyses by age and gender show variations in the influencing factors for different groups: for those under 60 years old, Road Density is the most influential factor; for the 61–70 age group, house price is the top factor; for the 71–80 age group, age is the most significant factor; for those over 81 years old, building height is the leading factor; in males, GDP is the most influential factor; and in females, age is the most influential factor. This study explores the feasibility and performance of machine learning in predicting CHD risk in the built environment of cold regions and provides a comprehensive methodology and workflow for predicting cardiovascular disease risk based on refined neighborhood-level built environment factors, offering scientific support for the construction of sustainable healthy cities.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/buildings14124024,"",,

The natural landscape is the main part and combined with artificial beautification technology to create a space landscape. Modern planning and design mainly focus on environmental protection and the sustainable development of natural resources. As a natural way of human communication, speech has inherent advantages as a means of human-computer interaction. Automatic speech recognition should enable computers to ""understand"" human speech and convert speech sequences into text sequences. With the development of deep learning, speech recognition based on deep neural networks has become more and more common. There are currently two frameworks for internal speech recognition modeling: hybrid framework and end-to-end architecture.

rayyan-210784209,Research into the Influence Mechanisms of Visual-Comfort and Landscape Indicators of Urban Green Spaces,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Urban green spaces play a crucial role in providing social services and enhancing residents’ mental health. It is essential for sustainable urban planning to explore the relationship between urban green spaces and human perceptions, particularly their visual comfort. However, most current research has analyzed green spaces using two-dimensional indicators (remote sensing), which often overlook human visual perceptions. This study combined two-dimensional and three-dimensional methods to evaluate urban green spaces. Additionally, the study employed machine learning to quantify residents’ visual comfort in green-space environments and explored the relationship between green spaces and human visual perceptions. The results indicated that Kitakyushu exhibited a moderate FCV and an extremely low Green View Index (GVI). Yahatanishi-ku was characterized as having the highest visual comfort. Tobata-ku demonstrated the lowest visual comfort. Natural, GVI, openness, enclosure, vegetation diversity, landscape diversity, and NDBI were positively correlated with visual comfort. FCV and ENVI were negatively correlated with visual comfort. Vegetation diversity had the most impact on improving visual comfort. By integrating remote sensing and street-view data, this study introduces a methodology to ensure a more holistic assessment of green spaces. Urban planners could use it to better identify areas with insufficient green space or areas that require improvement in terms of green-space quality. Meanwhile, it could be helpful in providing valuable input for formulating more effective green-space policies and improving overall urban environmental quality.

rayyan-210784210,A Scene–Object–Economy Framework for Identifying and Validating Urban–Rural Fringe Using Multisource Geospatial Big Data,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Rapid urbanization has led to the emergence of urban–rural fringes, complex transitional zones that challenge traditional urban–rural dichotomies. While these areas play a crucial role in urban development, their precise identification remains a significant challenge. Existing methods often rely on single-dimensional metrics or administrative boundaries, failing to capture the multi-faceted nature of these zones. This study introduces a novel “Scene–Object–Economy” (SOE) framework to address these limitations and enhance the precision of urban–rural fringe identification. Our approach integrates multisource geospatial big data, including remote sensing imagery, nightlight data, buildings, and Points of Interest (POI), leveraging machine learning techniques. The SOE framework constructs feature from three dimensions: scene (image features), object (buildings), and economy (POIs). This multidimensional methodology allows for a more comprehensive and nuanced mapping of urban–rural fringes, overcoming the constraints of traditional methods. The study demonstrates the effectiveness of the SOE framework in accurately delineating urban–rural fringes through multidimensional validation. Our results reveal distinct spatial patterns and characteristics of these transitional zones, providing valuable insights for urban planners and policymakers. Furthermore, the integration of dynamic population data as a separate layer of analysis offers a unique perspective on population distribution patterns within the identified fringes.

rayyan-210784218,What Is My Plaza for? Implementing a Machine Learning Strategy for Public Events Prediction in the Urban Square,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Plazas are an essential pillar of public life in our cities. Historically, they have been seen as public fora, hosting public events that fostered trade, interaction, and debate. However, with the rise of modern urbanism, city planners considered them as part of a larger strategic development scheme overlooking their social importance. As a result, plazas have lost their function and value. In recent years, awareness has risen of the need to re-activate these public spaces to strive for social inclusion and urban resilience. Geometric and urban features of plazas and their surroundings often suggest what kinds of usage the public can make of them. In this project, we explore the application of machine learning to predict the suitability of events in public spaces, aiming to enhance urban plaza design. Learning from traditional urbanism indicators, we consider factors associated with the features of the public space, such as the number of people and the high degree of comfort, which are evolved from three subcategories: external factors, geometric shape, and design factors. We acknowledge that the predictive capability of our model is constrained by a relatively small dataset, comprising 15 real plazas in Madrid augmented digitally to 2025 fictional scenarios through self-organising maps. The article details the methods to quantify and enumerate quantitative urban features. With a categorical target variable, a classification model is trained to predict the type of event in the urban space. The model is then evaluated locally in Grasshopper by visualising a parametric verified geometry and deploying the model on other existing plazas worldwide regarding geographical proximity to Madrid, where to share or not the same cultural and environmental conditions. Despite these limitations, our findings offer valuable insights into the potential of machine learning in urban planning, suggesting pathways for future research to expand upon this foundational study.","",https://doi.org/10.17645/up.8551,"",,

Urban areas, with their large energy consumption, stand to benefit significantly from the integration of geothermal systems. With the growing need to harness renewable energy sources efficiently, the detection of urban subsurface resources represents a critical frontier in the pursuit of sustainability. The Guangdong Bay area, known for its abundant geothermal resources, stands at the forefront of this green energy revolution, so, in our study, we chose to evaluate Zhuhai City, which is a city representative of the resource-rich area of Guangdong. With the progress of geographic information system (GIS) technology, the land surface temperature (LST) has been used to monitor the spatial distribution characteristics of geothermal anomalies. However, relatively few studies have been conducted in the field of urban geothermal resources. In this study, we calculated the LST of Zhuhai City using Landsat 8 remote sensing data and then investigated the distributions of geothermal hot springs. Spatial data layers were constructed, including the geological structure, DEM and derivatives, lithology, and urban regions, and, based on technology with the integration of machine learning, their spatial correlations with geothermal anomalies were analyzed. The support vector machine (SVM) and the multilayer perceptron (MLP) were employed to produce maps of potential geothermal resources, and their susceptibility levels were divided into five classes: very low, low, moderate, high, and very high. Through model interpretation, we found the moderate-susceptibility class to dominate at 26.90% (SVM) and 46.27% (MLP) according to the two models. Considering the influence of artificial areas, we also corrected the original LST by identifying urban areas of thermal anomalies via the urban thermal anomaly leapfrog fusion extraction (UTALFE) method; following this augmentation, the results shifted to 24.16% (SVM) and 28.67% (MLP). Meanwhile, the area under the curve (AUC) values of all results were greater than 0.65, showing the superior performance and the high applicability of the chosen study area. This study demonstrates that data-driven models integrating thermal infrared remote sensing technology are a promising tool for the mapping of potential urban geothermal resources for further exploration. Moreover, after correction, the reclassified LST results of urban areas are more authentic and suitable for the mapping of potential geothermal resources.

Three diverse density character zones were selected, including two within and one outside the Colombo Municipal Council (CMC), and subjected to the model's application. Expert validation indicated that while both simultaneous and sequential models replicate realistic data, the simultaneous model is more suitable for determining ideal building density. This study demonstrates the integration of GT and ML as a powerful strategy for individual and group decision-making in urban planning. Accurately calculated payoffs using the GTIDM model, which align with the study’s goals and strategies, are crucial.

This poses a challenge in capturing and representing the various human values associated with them. The Branching Out project seeks to develop a valuation approach for trees in the urban environment that incorporates cultural and social values of the wider community. The project focuses on the task of assigning value to tree assets at scale, incorporating the diverse and subjective perspectives that communities hold. The study develops methodologies that account for the ways in which individuals and communities perceive, appreciate, and derive value from urban trees, ultimately contributing to more comprehensive and inclusive approaches to urban tree valuation. To provide valuation at scale, a remote sensing methodology was developed, using 30cm aerial hyperspectral and 7cm resolution broadband imaging data. These data were captured over three target cities in the UK (York, Cardiff and Milton Keynes), representing a range of urban landscapes from historic city (York) to 20th Century `Garden City&amp;#8217; (Milton Keynes). A targeted sampling approach was used to complete ground biophysical surveys of all trees within 1 ha quadrats across each of the cities. Qualitative data from citizen and end-user panels were collected across all cities over a series of workshops.

This study focuses on monitoring, predicting and understanding land cover changes in the basin from 1987 to 2018, with projections up to 2030. It explores the intricate relationship between population growth and land cover dynamics, aiming to contribute to sustainable land management practices and align with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for 2030. Using a combination of neural network classification and the CA-Markov model, the study analyses historical land cover data to identify significant transformations. Between 1987 and 2018, bare lands increased by 29%, vegetation increased by 14%, built-up areas increased by 128% and waterbodies increased by 10%, whereas there was a 58% decline in the extent of wetlands. The most significant transformation occurred in the wetlands, with a total of 1819.46 km2 being converted to various land cover types. The results demonstrate remarkable shifts characterised by rapid urbanisation, substantial wetland loss and a decline in vegetation cover. Expectedly, population growth is found to be closely linked to the expansion of built-up areas while negatively impacting other land cover types. These findings underscore the urgent need for sustainable land management strategies that balance the demands of growing populations with the preservation of natural ecosystems and biodiversity. Furthermore, the study provides future projections that offer crucial insights for decision-makers involved in land use planning, biodiversity conservation and sustainable development.","",https://doi.org/10.14746/quageo-2024-0011,"",,

In addition, many western metropolises are characterized by an ageing population which may lead to an increased community-level sensitivity to heat extremes &amp;amp;#8211; that is the case in many European Functional Urban Areas (FUAs), including in the Greater Lisbon (hereinafter Lisbon) area. Lisbon has already a track record of being regularly exposure to severe heatwaves (HW), and regional climate change prospects point to its aggravation in coming decades (frequency, duration, and severity), as with other Southern European cities. Accordingly, there is a pressing need to pinpoint the urban locations where people are relatively more exposed to the excess heat, which can lead to dehydration, cerebrovascular accidents or thrombogenesis.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#160;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In this study, air temperature measurements from citizen owned meteorological stations is retrieved from open data platforms, quality controlled and co-located with Earth Observation (EO) data and products to downscale the official air temperature forecasts (from deterministic numerical weather predictions, NWP) from the native regional scale (2.5km) up to a metric spatial resolution (200m). As the NWP model resolves the regional physical processes, the Machine Learning (ML) high-resolution output is able to adjust its bias to the specificities of the urban location, by accurately predicting the local contribution of the urban heat island (UHI) effect, quantifying the heat anomaly at the neighborhood scale. The cooling effect of the urban green infrastructure is also detected, providing mensurable scenarios to support future urban greening initiatives. In addition, with these results, the identification of short-term critical areas during heatwave events becomes possible, supporting the local public health stakeholders in their decision-making &amp;amp;#8211; i.e., regarding where and when to act.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu23-2658,"",,

An extensive overview of the development potential for both present and future is provided through an investigation of spatially shifting behaviors of LULC and modeling of prospective eventualities. With a 20-year approximation from 2000 to 2020, we used substantial multi-temporal data collected via satellite to explore opportunities for evolution from one spatiotemporal transition state to a subsequent and prospective LULC model. In the MOLUSCE plugin of Q-GIS, uncorrelated parameters (DEM, gradient, and location concerning roadways) have been combined with an incorporated CA-ANN technique. Throughout previous three decades, impervious surface area increased from 12.48% to 28.91%, while water levels increased from 1.43% to 1.39%, demonstrating that physical and social driving forces had significant influence on landscape pattern. Urbanization and development are reflected from rising water table and shrinking impermeable surface. Land use shifts or climatic variability may result decline in water levels, whereas the rise in impermeable surfaces points in the direction of proliferation of metropolitan region. The quantity of dry land decreased from 48.28% to 43.11%, the verdant area was 27.34% to 13.77%, and woodland shrank from 22.70% to 12.64%. The estimates from 2030 to 2040 further endorse an increasing shift toward impermeable terrain at the expense of substantial forests and natural habitats. For successful land management, urban planning, and sustainable development, LULC trends must be precisely predicted. In-depth reviews and analyses of predictive modeling approaches utilized for LULC prediction are provided in the study. This study investigates frequently used data sources and preprocessing methods, looks at difficulties with LULC prediction, and offers critical assessment of modeling strategies. The report also outlines future research priorities and explores possible uses of the LULC prediction model uses.</italic>","",https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-3671270/v1,"",,

Since the proposal of the ""2030 Agenda"", the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal indicator 11.7.1 aims to calculate the accessibility and quality of urban open spaces(UOS). An accurate and rapid assessment framework of UOS is of great significance for urban sustainable development. Previous research on UOS has mainly focused on the evolution patterns of UOS, with little research on assessments of their accessibility for different population structures (i.e., men vs. women, young vs. older). In this study, a U-Net deep learning network was used for training from 3072 annotated samples of urban green spaces(UGS) which was created based on Gaofen-2 remote sensing images. The trained model was used to identify UGS within five districts of Beijing at sub-meter level, incorporated with Open Street Map and area of interest data. A spatial analysis was conducted for accessibility of UOS, finding that most of the UOS in the central urban area of Beijing can be reached within 10 minutes, but access to the eastern and western edges is poorer (more than 30 minutes). Finally, using Worldpop data, the accessibility of UOS was statistically analyzed for different ages and genders. The results show that UOS accessibility rate for the elderly and children reaches over 90% (10 minutes accessibility).","",https://doi.org/10.5194/isprs-annals-x-1-w1-2023-387-2023,"",,

rayyan-210784268,Impervious Surfaces from High Resolution Aerial Imagery: Cities in Fresno County,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"This study investigates impervious surfaces — areas covered by materials with restricted water permeability, such as pavement, sidewalks, and parking lots—due to their crucial role in influencing water dynamics within urban landscapes. The impermeability of these surfaces disrupts natural water absorption processes, resulting in adverse environmental consequences such as increased flooding, erosion, and water pollution. The research employs impervious surface analysis, a method involving the mapping and analysis of these surfaces within specified study areas, including cities, counties, and census tracts. Remote sensing techniques, specifically satellites and aerial imagery, are commonly utilized for the identification and classification of impervious surfaces. In the context of Fresno County, diverse classification methods, encompassing pixel-based, object-based, and deep learning approaches, are employed to classify and evaluate impervious surfaces. Significantly, the deep learning classification method exhibits exceptional performance, achieving an impressive overall accuracy ranging between 85-92%. The study reveals that the estimated percentage of impervious surfaces in Fresno County cities approximates 45%, comparable to the characteristics of medium density residential areas. Noteworthy is the observation in the Fresno/Clovis city area, where the percentage of impervious surfaces escalated from 53% in 2010 (per EnviroAtlas) to 63% in 2020. This 10% increase over a decade closely aligns with concurrent population growth trends in the region. In conclusion, this research underscores the critical significance of comprehending and monitoring impervious surfaces due to their pivotal role in shaping the environmental quality and resilience of urban areas.

rayyan-210784287,An analysis to interpret the heterogeneous resident's willingness to pay for green roofs to improve the understanding of decision heterogeneity,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Urban waterlogging has become a frequent and threatening issue in recent years due to rapid urbanization and extreme weather conditions, resulting in economic losses and health hazards. In this context, green roofs (GRs) emerge as a sustainable and innovative solution to mitigate these issues by absorbing rainfall, reducing runoff, and enhancing urban biodiversity. Despite the apparent benefits, the adoption of GRs remains limited, largely due to a lack of quantitative understanding of the factors that influence urban residents' GR adoption willingness. This study aims to fill this knowledge gap via a survey approach, and distribute and collect survey responses from 999 residents in Shenzhen, a rapidly developing coastal city in China. The survey is designed to capture a range of variables that may influence residents' decision-making regarding GR adoption, including demographic information, housing characteristics, waterlogging experiences, roof utilization preference, knowledge of and preference for GR, and willingness to adopt GR. The GR adoption willingness is collected assuming two policy scenarios, one with government subsidy and the other without. By leveraging a machine learning model for data analysis, the study identifies five key predictors that commonly influence GR adoption willingness with and without subsidy: recognition of the advantages of GRs (GR_advantage), whether a resident lives on the top floor (Top_floor), the degree of concern about GRs (GR_concern), the duration of waterlogging experienced in and around the community (WL_time), and the individual's level of education (Education). Interestingly, the study also reveals that GR adoption willingness is affected differently under scenarios with and without policy incentives. In the absence of subsidies, the property fee (Pro_fee) is a significant factor; conversely, when policy incentives are present, age and house ownership (House_own) emerge as influential factors. The complexity of these influencing factors is further evaluated using the SHAP (SHapley Additive explanation) model, which provides a nuanced interpretation of how these factors interact and exert nonlinear impacts on residents' willingness to adopt GRs. The insights derived from this analysis are critical for policymakers and urban planners who are looking to promote GRs as part of an integrated urban water management strategy. Specifically, a combination of long-term subsidies and one-time subsidies can be combined to motivate residential adoption. Recognizing the general unfamiliarity with GRs and related policies among residents, relevant outreach and education programs are essential. In addition, targeted subsidy levels could be helpful in stimulating more GR adoptions. An important consideration in this targeting process is the frequency of waterlogging events, which has been shown to significantly influence residents' willingness to pay for GRs. &amp;#160;","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu24-11013,"",,

Using satellite imagery for real-time examination in Kuantan has become exceedingly expensive due to the scarcity and obsolescence of real-time LULC data. With the advent of remote sensing and geographical information systems, LULC change assessment is feasible. A quantitative assessment of image classification schemes (supervised classification using maximum likelihood and deep learning classification using random forest) was examined using 2022 Sentinel-2 satellite imagery to measure its performance. Kappa coefficient and overall accuracy were used to determine the classification accuracy. Then, 32 years of LULC changes in Kuantan were investigated using Landsat 5 TM, Landsat 8 OLI, and Sentinel-2 based on the best classifier. Random forest classification outperformed maximum likelihood classification with an overall accuracy of 85% compared to 92.8%. The findings also revealed that urbanisation is the main factor contributing to land changes in Kuantan, with a 32% increase in the build-up region and 32% in forest degradation. Despite the subtle and extremely dynamic connection between ecosystems, resources, and settlement, these LULC changes can be depicted using satellite imagery. With the precision of using a suitable classification scheme based on comprehensive, accurate and precise LULC maps can be generated, capturing the essence of spatial dynamics, especially in under-monitored basins.

This research bridges these gaps through an innovative interdisciplinary quantitative approach, integrating points of interest (POIs) and street view images (SVIs) to assess the street environments for older adults using ArcGIS and deep learning-based Fully Convolutional Networks. Specifically, Huangcun in Guangzhou, China, was selected for its typicality, with features like high density, complex street environments, and a significant older adult population. The findings reveal that while most age-friendly facilities meet basic needs, there are significant deficiencies in accessibility, comfort, and safety which call for targeted environmental improvements. This study contributes to sustainable urban development by providing street-by-street insights that empower urban planners to rectify spatial inequalities and to foster environments conducive to aging in place. By developing and applying a novel methodology that enhances urban age-friendliness assessments, this research extends the application of such models across diverse urban settings globally, promoting the integration of sustainability in urban planning.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/su17010031,"",,

Evaluating urban land suitability under sea level rise scenarios is crucial for promoting sustainable development. Recent research has advanced the application of artificial intelligence and the integration of GIS with models, yet the impact of climate change on land suitability has often been overlooked. This study focuses on Xihu District in Hangzhou, utilizing the entropy weight and matter-element model to evaluate land suitability for urban development. The evaluation results were cross-verified with land use plans. A comprehensive analysis of potential flood risk to urban land in 2100 was conducted, considering varying degrees of sea level rise under Sustainable Development Scenario SSP1-2.6 and High-end Emission Scenario SSP5-8.5, as well as the scenario reflecting the most severe sea level rise during extreme climate events. The results indicate that more than half of the land in the study area is suitable for construction, aligning spatially with the current planned urban land. The analysis process of the matter-element model reflects the impact level of each indicator on urban land suitability, conveying information both spatially and numerically, thus enhancing accuracy. Scenario analysis reveals that approximately 10% to 20% of urban land in the study area could face flooding threats due to future sea level rises, primarily in the northern and southeastern regions. Recommendations for future land development and spatial planning strategies to address flood risk are discussed, aiming to alleviate the pressure on urban land in response to future climate change.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/su16083485,"",,

We developed a deep learning model based on the DeepLabV3 architecture, which was trained on satellite imagery from Landsat-8 and the ESRI LULC dataset, augmented with human settlement data from the GHS-SMOD. The model utilizes semantic segmentation to classify land into detailed categories, including urban and rural areas, at a 10-meter resolution. Our findings demonstrate that incorporating LULC along with urban and rural classifications significantly enhances the model's ability to accurately distinguish between urban, rural, and non-human settlement areas.

Previous studies have been limited in regard to the large-scale spatial identification of RPs due to the vagueness of boundaries and the lack of appropriate data sources and efficient tools. Furthermore, human perception of these places remains unclear. To address this gap, this research adopts a novel approach to identify and evaluate the RPs of a city from the perspective of human perception. Our methodology involves the utilization of deep learning systems, text semantic analysis, and other techniques to integrate multi-source data, including points of interest (POIs), street view images, and social media data. Taking Nanjing, China, as a case, we identified 192 RPs and their perceptual ranges (PRRPs). The results show the following: (1) Comparing RPs to non-RPs, RPs show higher average scores across four perceptual dimensions (positive indicators): Beautiful (7.11% higher), Lively (34.23% higher), Safety (28.42% higher), and Wealthy (28.26% higher). Conversely, RPs exhibit lower average scores in two perceptual dimensions (negative indicators): Boring (79.04% lower) and Depressing (20.35% lower). (2) Across various perceptual dimensions, RPs have utilized 15.13% of the land area to effectively cover approximately 50% of human perceptual hotspots and cold spots. (3) The RPs exhibit significant variations across different types, levels, and human preferences. These results demonstrate the positive perceived effects that RPs have, providing valuable insights to support urban management, the transformation of the built environment, and the promotion of sustainable urban development, and provide guidance for urban planners and designers to make improvements in urban design and planning to make these sites more attractive.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/su16198299,"",,

Especially, recent studies turn to self-supervised contrastive learning with manually designed similarity metrics for urban imagery representation learning and further socioeconomic prediction, which however suffers from effectiveness and robustness issues. To address such issues, in this paper, we propose a Knowledge-infused Contrastive Learning (KnowCL) model for urban imagery-based socioeconomic prediction. Specifically, we firstly introduce knowledge graph (KG) to effectively model the urban knowledge in spatiality, mobility, etc., and then build neural network based encoders to learn representations of an urban image in associated semantic and visual spaces, respectively. Finally, we design a cross-modality based contrastive learning framework with a novel image-KG contrastive loss, which maximizes the mutual information between semantic and visual representations for knowledge infusion. Extensive experiments of applying the learnt visual representations for socioeconomic prediction on three datasets demonstrate the superior performance of KnowCL with over 30\% improvements on $R^2$ compared with baselines.

The meteorological data sets used in this research offer a high-resolution grid, which facilitates a detailed examination of each building block. Furthermore, the system is capable of generating forecasts and alerts for imminent climate events, such as heatwaves or extreme nighttime temperatures.The CVI and alerts are derived from an integration of diverse data types, including energy consumption, climate and weather data, socioeconomic factors, and building characteristics.

Future research should emphasize interdisciplinary integration, combining ecology, urban planning, meteorology, and public health. By utilizing advanced technologies, such as drones, remote sensing, AI, and big data analysis, we can improve data accuracy and the generalizability of research findings. Additionally, it is crucial to consider the performance of GI under different climatic conditions and socio-economic contexts to comprehensively quantify its overall benefits in terms of air quality, urban thermal comfort, public health, and economic impact. This comprehensive approach will provide a scientific basis for policy-making and urban planning.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/su16166765,"",,
rayyan-210784397,Architectural Strategies for Flood Mitigation in Urban Environments: A Study of Traditional Elements and Contemporary Resilience,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Natural disasters cause extensive losses worldwide annually. Flood events are responsible for economic and life-threatening damages[1]. To mitigate flood risks and resulting damages, particularly in the construction of residential buildings, two approaches exist. First: constructing in areas with lower flood susceptibility, and second: implementing architectural solutions to fortify structures against floods and associated hazards. Due to the presence of water resources, rivers, etc., prompting urban expansion due to reasons like transportation, trade, agricultural use, household consumption, etc., construction near rivers and flood-prone areas becomes inevitable[2]. This underscores the importance of the second approach&amp;#8212;architectural fortification. In this study, areas highly susceptible to flooding were identified from flood zoning maps using artificial intelligence to adapt these maps and estimate the most hazardous regions[3]. Subsequently, by examining the specific elements of traditional architecture in each of these areas and exploring the cause and function of each element in facing floods over time, attention is given to the particular and regional (indigenous) architectural features that have responded to floods. Finally, appropriate architectural measures and responses to reduce flood risks, such as constructing at elevation or suitable gradients, is combined with early warning systems to provide a proper route for the future construction projects.

rayyan-210784402,Integrating CEDGAN and FCNN for Enhanced Evaluation and Prediction of Plant Growth Environments in Urban Green Spaces,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Conducting precise evaluations and predictions of the environmental conditions for plant growth in green spaces is crucial for ensuring their health and sustainability. Yet, assessing the health of urban greenery and the plant growth environment represents a significant and complex challenge within the fields of urban planning and environmental management. This complexity arises from two main challenges: the limitations in acquiring high-density, high-precision data, and the difficulties traditional methods face in capturing and modeling the complex nonlinear relationships between environmental factors and plant growth. In light of the superior spatial interpolation capabilities of CEDGAN (conditional encoder–decoder generative adversarial neural network), notwithstanding its comparative lack of robustness across different subjects, and the excellent ability of FCNN (fully connected neural network) to fit multiple nonlinear equation models, we have developed two models based on these network structures. One model performs high-precision spatial attribute interpolation for urban green spaces, and the other predicts and evaluates the environmental conditions for plant growth within these areas. Our research has demonstrated that, following training with various samples, the CEDGAN network exhibits satisfactory performance in interpolating soil pH values, with an average pixel error below 0.03. This accuracy in predicting both spatial distribution and feature aspects improves with the increase in sample size and the number of controlled sampling points, offering an advanced method for high-precision spatial attribute interpolation in the planning and routine management of urban green spaces. Similarly, FCNN has shown commendable performance in predicting and evaluating plant growth environments, with prediction errors generally less than 0.1. Comparing different network structures, models with fewer hidden layers and nodes yielded superior training outcomes.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/agronomy14050938,"",,

Therefore, it does not get the as much as attention it requires. Soil pollution emerging as an important threat to soil function for which specific accelerated actions are needed, to maintain nutrient balance, offset the effects of soil pollution, salinization, and soil erosion, and sustains overall soil quality. The physical, chemical, and mineralogical composition of soil is greatly influenced by the processes like weathering, erosion, transportation, and deposition. Thus, an understanding of the processes that controls the behavior of the source material is essential for qualitative as well as quantitative characterization of soil. The sustainable management of soil is directly or indirectly crucial for mineral resource management, nutrient balance, crop production, environmental sustainability, and on human health. Thus, soil heath status study not only will provide an early indication of the problems associated with soil nutrient surplus or a deficit but also it helps in crop yields management. This chapter provides a depth knowledge about the relation between the soil health and nutrient flow by identifying the root cause from the system, i.e., at the field level, farm level, and regional level. This process is done with the help of traditional knowledge and high-resolution 436data like multispectral data, hyperspectral data, and geographic information system (GIS) approach for spatial variability-based methods proposed in this study. This chapter's main focus is to manage the spatial variability of soils and nutrients availability by using the techniques like machine learning (ML) and the internet of things (IoT). Digital information extraction method can be broadly used in agricultural field to help farmers to increase productivity, pest management and land sustainability practices. Agriculture can be integrated into urban and peri-urban areas which can contribute to the self-sufficient neighborhood while, reconnecting people with nature and consumption with production.

Urbanization has led to an increase in impervious surfaces, which alters hydrological flow pattern and delivers non-point pollutants to the stream more efficiently. In addition, intensification of agricultural activities can result in the increased nutrient loads due to alternations in surface soil properties. Hence, it is necessary to understand the impact of surrounding environment with specific emphasis on geographical factors (e.g. climate change, land use patterns and landscape metrics) on the RWQ in order to develop sustainable water quality management strategies effectively. We collected pollutant concentration Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD), Total Phosphorus (T-P), and&amp;#160; Total Organic Carbon(TOC) from monitoring stations in the Nakdong River watershed. To utilize field monitoring data, we developed a Machine Learning (ML) models (DNN, XGBoost and Random Forest) to predict RWQ in accordance with different environmental factors. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) was used to illustrate the significance of land uses and landscape patterns on RWQ in Nakdong River. The results of this study can (1) demonstrate the relationship of water quality variables with land uses and landscape patterns, (2) identify pollution sources and factors that affect Nakdong River, and (3) support catchment managers and stakeholders in evaluating the benefits and risks of water management strategies in priority areas.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu23-10487,"",,

The urban campus environment, being the primary habitat for college students, plays a crucial role in influencing their mental health. Design/methodology/approach Based on survey data from 34 Chinese universities and 1173 college students in 2021, this study utilized deep learning and street view images to explore the relationship between various urban campus landscapes, college students' exercise participation, and mental health. Findings The study revealed substantial variations in campus landscape features, particularly in terms of spatial openness. While green campus landscapes (measured by the Green View Index and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) showed no significant impact on exercise participation or mental health, the Sky View Factor did. Higher levels of campus openness and exercise frequency were associated with better mental health. The study also underscored that the influence of urban campus landscapes on college students' mental health was mediated by their exercise participation. Notably, spatial openness emerged as the most prominent differentiating factor among urban campus landscape attributes, significantly affecting students' exercise participation and mental health.

Previous studies have mainly investigated the driving mechanisms of waterlogging in urban agglomeration at a single scale, but urban agglomeration space has greater spatio-temporal heterogeneity, it is often difficult to fully reveal such characteristics at single scale. Therefore, this paper tries to investigate spatio-temporal evolution characteristics and driving mechanisms of waterlogging events in urban agglomerations based on a multi-scale perspective. The results indicate that: (1) The degree of waterlogging and high-density zones increases in the GBA, and the waterlogging points are spatially polycentric. However, the degree of waterlogging in Hong Kong is decreasing. (2) The influence of land cover characteristics and topography on waterlogging is dominant at all scales, with ISP and AI having the highest influence, followed by RE and Slope. ISP∩Slope and ISP∩RE are the key interactions for waterlogging in urban agglomeration. (3) It is found that the results at the grid scale are better than those at the basin scale.

rayyan-210784475,MULTI-TEMPORAL URBAN LAND-USE CHANGE DETECTION AND PREDICTION USING CNN-BASED CA-MARKOV MODEL FROM GAOFEN SATELLITE IMAGES,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract. The intelligent interpretation of land-use change has become a research frontier. Reasonably and effectively utilizing limited land resources and making scientific predictions to promote sustainable utilization of land resources is significant for establishing a resource-saving and environmentally friendly society. Remote sensing technology can efficiently complete multi-temporal and dynamic land-use change detection, especially using high-spatial resolution remote sensing images. However, the existing land-use change and prediction have not been combined. In addition, land-use change detection mainly relies on shallow feature design, resulting in low prediction accuracy and weak generalization performance. To solve the above problems, we proposed a CNN-based CA Markov model using multi-temporal GaoFen satellite remote sensing images for the change detection and prediction of land cover. Taking the city of Panzhihua in China as an example, the study constructed training sample data that includes a multi-temporal remote sensing training dataset from 2006, 2010, 2015, and 2021 using GaoFen satellite remote sensing images. Meanwhile, a multitemporal CNN land-use detection model was constructed to generate a land-use transfer matrix by training the dataset. Furthermore, the comprehensive driving factors were selected, including terrain factors (height and slope) and social factors (economic and population density). Then, the CA-Markov model was constructed to predict the land-use development trend in Panzhihua City after ten years. Compared with the traditional methods, experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model can improve the model's automatic interpretation ability and prediction accuracy with an increase of 24.6% in the FoM index and 4.37% in the Kappa coefficient.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/isprs-archives-xlviii-m-3-2023-279-2023,"",,
rayyan-210784477,"New Light Vehicles’ Solutions for Active, Sustainable, and Inclusive Urban Mobility of Older Users",,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Among the actions planned to achieve the goal of the European Green Deal to become climate neutral by 2050 is accelerating the transition to sustainable and smart mobility [1]. The action indicates the need to put the user at the center and to reduce emissions by 90% by 2050 through the development of multimodal, automated, and connected mobility using clean and sustainable energy sources.While the transition to electric cars enables the reduction of fossil fuel consumption and urban pollution, on the other hand it does not alleviate urban traffic and parking problems, and presents a major challenge regarding the recycling of end-of-life vehicles and batteries.For this reasons micro-mobility solutions, which include a wide range of light vehicles such as e-bikes and e-scooters (shared and personal), represent an alternative with great potential capable of contributing to the creation of healthy and smart environments, balancing a low demand for physical effort with a substantial environmental benefit [2]. However, many studies highlight how these solutions are currently attractive primarily to a younger target [3] and within specific usage scenarios related to the tourism and recreational context [3] and last-mile connections for commuters [2]. Due to reduced physical performance, in fact, ease of travel by bicycle can be an insurmountable barrier for older users [4]. The same barrier also recurs in the case of e-scooters, for which skepticism and risk perception are even higher, mainly due to the balance control skills that the vehicle requires when being used [3], as well as road safety issues and inadequate infrastructure for micro-mobility.This means that a large share of users remain excluded from the solutions currently available, with a strong negative impact on the development of sustainable mobility, considering the fact that current demographic trends highlight the progressive increase in the number of elderly citizens in many countries around the world. Promoting micro-mobility as the most efficient urban and peri-urban mobility system in terms of emissions, energy and material consumption therefore implies a paradigm shift in the design of light vehicles, with a design for inclusion approach that overcomes the main issues limiting their deployment and leads to new functional solutions to better meet the needs of older user groups [5]. The paper presents some research results in this topic, which, starting from the identification of emerging needs and trends in urban and peri-urban mobility of older users with different lifestyles, investigates new scenarios of use, aimed at the inclusion of a wide range of users, in the development of light vehicles and the study of potential offered by artificial intelligence to make vehicles and people autonomous.With the aim of improving people's ability to move autonomously, sustainably and inclusively, three design solutions of light vehicles for people and goods, inclusive and unisex, were developed, all oriented at promoting an active and healthy lifestyle, and improving safety, independence and efficiency in user mobility at urban level. The projects presented in this paper were selected among the concepts that emerged within various Design Sprint sessions held with young designers and in one case developed for participation in a Horizon-CL5-2023-D5-01 project.

Understanding system responses to disturbances is crucial for disaster risk reduction (DRR). Nighttime light (NTL) data have increasing value in disaster research, as they reflect human activities and infrastructure changes. However, a comprehensive analysis of the diversity of NTL change and the influential factors remains incompletely understood. In this study, we developed a framework for analyzing NTL change patterns mainly focused on short-term detection and applied it to the assessment of Typhoon Mangkhut. Our investigation highlights the effectiveness of daily nighttime light data (NASA's Black Marble nighttime light dataset). Specifically, we identified six patterns of nighttime light variation and analyzed their distribution across different land use types. We also explored how factors shape different patterns by using interpretable machine-learning methods.Our findings indicate that urban areas with higher economic development and population density tend to witness increased nighttime light levels in the post-disaster emergency stage after Typhoon Mangkhut. Conversely, rural and natural areas tend to show sustained declines. Influential factors analysis indicates that disaster-inducing factors, such as wind, precipitation, and distance to the typhoon, predominantly impact agricultural areas, signifying direct typhoon-induced effects on vegetation and infrastructure. On the other hand, disaster-bearing factors like GDP, population density, and road density play a more significant role in urban areas, reflecting the socioeconomic status and adaptability of regions. Additionally, the upsurge in nighttime light in the post-disaster stage in urban areas can be primarily attributed to elevated travelling due to vegetation clearance.Our study introduces a framework for pattern analysis in extreme events, offering insights and recommendations for disaster management and mitigation.

Vietnam, being one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change and natural disasters, is devoting great efforts to achieve sustainable development goals and net zero emissions by 2050 as well as to improve productivity and national competitiveness. In this context, innovation, digital transformation in training, basic and applied research on EME become more urgent than ever for green, circular development and response to global change, sustainable development, prosperity, and safety of the country, the region and the world. The fields of Earth, Mines, and Environmental sciences (EME) have emerged and evolved alongside with the evolution of human society, and have created a profound impact on all aspects of life and socio-economic development through utilizing natural resources, impacting the environment, and driving global change. The robust development of these areas serves as the foundation for various other fundamental and applied sciences, and concurrently acts as a catalyst for technological advancements worldwide, contributing to the common prosperity and safety of humankind as well as the conservation of the blue Earth. The EME with the theme of “Earth and Environmental Sciences, Mining for Digital Transformation, Green Development and Response to Global Change” (GREEN EME 2023) was held in Ho Chi Minh City in December 29, 2023. The GREEN EME 2023 was successfully co-organized by Viet Nam National University Ho Chi Minh City, in collaboration with Viet Nam Meteorological and Hydrological Administration, the Interdisciplinary Council for Professorship of Earth - Mining Sciences, as well as various research institutes and local and international higher education institutions. The GREEN EME 2023 covers six topics: (i) Big Data and Artificial Intelligence in Earth Sciences, Mines, Environment; (ii) Digital Transformation in Earth, Mining, Environmental Sciences; (iii) Sustainable energy transition for green, renewable (wind power, solar power, gas power, geothermal, garbage electricity, hydrogen, etc.) and low carbon emission technologies; (iv) Circular economy in resource-mineral management and sustainable development; (v) Climate change response and disaster risk reduction; (vi) Solutions to promote innovation in the fields of Earth Science, Mining and Environment to meet the goal of sustainable development. Overall, the Conference has attracted more than 100 papers from scientists, researchers, government managers, and graduate students. Among them, 90 high-quality papers were recommended to submit for peer-reviewing. Then, the double-blind review process was carried out for the 85 papers, in which each paper has been reviewed for its merit and novelty by at least two reviewers and one editor by matching the content areas. As a result, a total of 24 papers have been finally selected to be published in IOP Conference Series: Earth and Environmental Science. It is strongly believed that this proceedings provides a broad overview of recent advanced studies in the fields of Earth, Mines, and Environmental sciences with a profound impact on all aspects of life and socio-economic development through utilizing natural resources, impacting the environment, and driving global change.

rayyan-210784523,Examining the Feasibility of GeoAI and IoT for Smart Flood Early Warning Systems in Local Communities for Caribbean Urban Spaces,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Over the last few decades, flooding has resulted in many problems that significantly impact countries in the Caribbean. This has been especially challenging in urban areas where widespread damage has occurred. In addition, given that over 50% of the world's population lives in urban areas, these locations are deemed to be vulnerable to climate-related disaster events that would further exacerbate the challenges in the region. These urban spaces in the Caribbean have limited access to real-time flood monitoring data for formulating and supporting policies for disaster practitioners to coordinate timely preparedness and mitigation efforts. While flooding is complex, with a series of negative impacts on social and economic sectors, it is essential to provide a basis to support decision-making information on vulnerability and resilience through early warning systems (EWS). However, the main obstacle in creating early warnings in the Caribbean is the suitability and availability of data for real-time flood prediction. While many methods of flood models have been applied in the traditional ways, the methods are complex and not readily adaptable to the context of the local community spaces, especially with limited available data. The Caribbean urban landscape is dynamically changing, which requires careful monitoring for predicting flooding. In a disaster, informing the community is critical for managing flooding risk. The adoption of GeoAI and IoT prepares the next frontier of models for usage in the Caribbean to close the gaps of modeling in data scarcity in urban areas. Consequently, there is a research gap from the perspective of short-term forecasting for sudden rainfall events in urban spaces in the Caribbean. Given the early warning system culture in the Caribbean has an environment of real-time data of scarce resources, it is necessary to forge an approach for real-time forecasting flooding impact in urban spaces. The paper provides a preliminary analysis of the feasibility of machine learning and IoT use in supporting EWS in Caribbean urban spaces.","",https://doi.org/10.47412/swec5084,"",,
rayyan-210784524,Assessing Future hydrological response of an urban watershed using machine learning based LULC forecasting models,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Urbanization in terms of land-use/cover (LULC) change has a long-term significant impact on the hydrological cycle as the LULC is one of the most important influencing parameters to produce curve number (CN). The drastic change in LULC changes the CN. This change directly affects surface water including peak flows. This study aims to assess the change in surface runoff due to changes in LULC. Hydrological modeling is done for the consistent long-term behavioral study of surface runoff. The area focused on the study is the Kharun river, a tributary of the Mahanadi River. For the assessment of the impact of LULC change on the catchment discharge, a daily-step conceptual model soil and water assessment tool (SWAT) was applied. Landuse maps were prepared with the Landsat Thematic Mapper satellite images. The future land use was forecasted with the technique of spatial statistical modeling. The machine learning (ML) tool is used for quantifying the influences on the LULC change dynamics and producing the LULC map for 2024 and 2030. Remote sensing (RS) and geographic information system (GIS) analysis were coupled with hydrological SWAT modeling to investigate the connection between the LULC change and hydrologic regime. The SWAT Model’s calibration efficiency is verified by comparing the simulated and observed discharge time series at the Patharidih gauge and discharge station. The monthly and daily calibrations were quite satisfactory, with Nash-Sutcliffe an efficiency coefficient of 0.86 and 0.67. This modeling provides reliable information for sustainable management of available water resources of the catchment.","",https://doi.org/10.25303/1711da035048,"",,
rayyan-210784530,Monitoring Coastline Dynamics Using Satellite Remote Sensing and Geographic Information Systems: A Review of Global Trends,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Nearly half of the world's population lives near the coasts of oceans and seas. The coastline position changes under the influence of multiple natural and anthropogenic factors. Recently, due to the global impacts of climate change and population growth, the issue of geomorphological changes in coastlines has become more critical. Therefore, the assessment and mapping of coastline dynamics is one of the most essential factors for sustainable development goals and urban planning. The objectives of this study are to focus on discussing the research progress of applications of satellite remote sensing datasets and GIS methods for coastline extraction, mapping, and analysis along global coasts. A systematic review and trend analysis of the most recent published studies that focused on remote sensing and GIS techniques for assessing coastal dynamics were published between 2012 and 2022 along different coasts worldwide. The results indicated that multisource and multisensor remote sensing datasets were globally utilized for monitoring coastline changes, including (1) medium-resolution imagery such as Sentinel and Landsat, (2) SAR and optical high-resolution imagery, (3) modern remote sensing technologies such as UAV and LiDAR, and (4) GIS-based methods, spatial analysis, and artificial intelligence. This study concludes that coastal change can be tracked using any form of remote sensing, including drones, LiDAR, higher resolution imaging, and Landsat imagery. This review provides a comprehensive reference for upcoming work on coastal management and exploitation development and research, especially for the low elevation coastal zones that are affected by coastal hazards.","",https://doi.org/10.21608/cat.2024.233931.1196,"",,
rayyan-210784541,"The Influence of Climate Change and Socioeconomic Transformations on Land Use and NDVI in Ordos, China",,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Land use change is related to a series of core issues of global environmental change, such as environmental quality improvement, sustainable utilization of resources, energy reuse and climate change. In this study, Google Earth Engine (GEE), a remote sensing natural environment monitoring and analysis platform, was used to realize the combination of Landsat TM/OLI data images with spectral features and topographic features, and the random forest machine learning classification method was used to supervise and classify the low-cloud composite image data of Ordos City. The results show that: (1) GEE has a powerful computing function, which can realize efficient and high-precision in-depth analysis of long-term multi-temporal remote sensing images and monitoring of land use change, and the accuracy of acquisition can reach 87%. Compared with other data sets in the same period, the overall and local classification results are more distinct than ESRI (Environmental Systems Research Institute) and GlobeLand 30 data products. Slightly lower than the Institute of Aerospace Information Innovation of the Chinese Academy of Sciences to obtain global 30 m of land cover fine classification products. (2) The overall accuracy of the land cover data of Ordos City from 2003 to 2023 is between 79–87%, and the Kappa coefficient is between 0.79–0.84. (3) Climate, terrain, population and other interactive factors combined with socio-economic population data and national and local policies are the main factors affecting land use change between 2003 and 2023.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/atmos15121489,"",,
rayyan-210784543,Coexistence and collaboration: Our Institute’s 2023 conference in Perth,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"I am writing this editorial on a very wintery day in Hobart, Tasmania, after returning from a convivial and interesting week at the Institute of Australian Geographers’ annual conference, held on unceded lands of the Whadjuk people of the Noongar Nation at the Bentley campus of Curtin University in Perth. Organised by a team from Curtin and the University of Western Australia and led by Tod Jones and Kirsten Martinus, the conference theme was coexistence, collaboration, and geography. For Jones and Martinez, “the theme recognises that the planet’s health and the human race’s survival are inextricably linked and that research outcomes are enriched by diverse partnerships and the contribution of individuals from many specialities” (see Miller, 2023). In 220 sessions over four days, over 235 attendees from 13 nations met in pre-conference workshops, plenaries, and study group and independent sessions to deliberate on that theme and other concerns central to our discipline and the professions it underpins. We were all privileged to be welcomed to Country by Kim Collard, an Elder and Balladong/Wilmen man of the Noongar Nation, who spoke to us about NAIDOC Week, the lands upon which we were meeting, and the special meeting of song lines on the Bentley campus. I note in passing and with gratitude that Wiley has selected three of our journal’s articles to feature in its own NAIDOC tribute (see here; Clements et al., 2023; Rawluk et al., 2023; Rogers et al., 2023). The team at Geographical Research, supported by Wiley and the Institute’s Council again hosted two lectures in Perth. First, Professor Mark Gahegan gave the Wiley Lecture, and it was riveting. A computer scientist and geographer based at the University of Auckland, Mark’s research includes geovisualisation, spatial analysis, geocomputation, and remote sensing. On this occasion, he shared fascinating insights on ChatGPT and artificial intelligence (AI) and, crucially, invited geographers to apply our interdisciplinarity capacities to help ensure AI futures involve empowering outcomes. Second, Dr Emma Ligtermoet gave the Fay Gale Memorial Lecture, and it was just as compelling. A CSIRO post-doctoral fellow and human-environment geographer from the University of Western Australia and Australian National University, Emma investigates how people navigate social-ecological change in freshwater and coastal environments. In this instance, her focus was on collaborative work in Pilbara communities committed to deepening coexistence work between Country and people. Thanks to Connor Goddard (Curtin) and Linda Wilson (University of Western Australia), I was privileged to host a conversation about writing and publishing with a group of around 50 higher degree research candidates. Some of the topics we explored included (a) why publishing matters intrinsically, strategically, and tactically; (b) how writing helps academics think, feel, speak, read, and plan careers—and how we can write and still balance work and life; (c) what it means to start the writing and publishing journey; (d) how a little insider knowledge about the higher education sector and academic practice can help that journey; and (e) why journal publishing matters but is not the whole story. At the end of our conversation, I elicited feedback and ideas about what else we can do to support candidates. Among the ideas are the following: What is the lived experience of sustained writing like in terms of process? How can we start and continue to write while living with the realities of precarious and challenging employment contexts? Does everything we write have to be accessible to the general public? How can we better reach out to diverse publics? What are the blessings and challenges of co-authorship and how do we retain agency in those relationships? How can I become a remarkable editor of my own writing? These are intriguing questions indeed, and I hope we can begin to address some of them in our webinars, co-hosted by the Institute and Wiley (see here for past episodes). Last but not least, I am delighted to report that the 2022 Wiley prize recipients for highly esteemed papers were also announced at the conference dinner. The three papers, all available in our journal website, are by Hine et al. (2022), Roelofsen and Carter-White (2022), and Tan and Liu (2022). Our warmest congratulations to all three writing teams, and our thanks to Wiley as well. As has become a practice for our journal, we begin this third issue of the year with a commentary by one of our associate editors, Clare Mouat (2023). Her focus is upon the ways in which regenerative—indeed loving—interventions are urgently needed to support radically positive pedagogies, policies, and geographical practices. Pushing back against tendencies to despair, Mouat invites readers to consider love as a critical lens in contemporary geography and to interrogate what that might mean in methodological terms for research, learning and teaching, and engagement. We would welcome more work on such agendas in this journal. Next is an important and deeply synthesising editorial by Rogers and Kearnes (2023), included in this issue but/and/also fronting our recent virtual issue on COVID-19—a collection of papers published since the pandemic’s outbreak that have been brought together in one convenient place. Beyond summarising the 18 papers included in the virtual issue, Rogers and Kearns carefully show how different papers are aligned to particular themes related to the geographies of COVID-19 mobilities COVID-19 governance; the urban geographies of the pandemic; its material geographies; its spatio-temporalities; and its pedagogic affects and effects. These foundational papers will be added to in coming months as we finalise a second tranche of papers on “legacies and anticipatory geographies of the pandemic including a few papers already published in the journal and assigned to issues but not yet in a virtual issue.” In this third issue, we also feature our 2022 Wiley Lecture, given by Gemma Sou (2023) and entitled “Communicating climate change with comics: life beyond apocalyptic imaginaries.” This paper includes both sophisticated analysis of complex challenges related to climate change and a video abstract that bring to life Sou’s comics and conceptual and empirical insights about the power of anti-essentialist representations of people’s experiences of extreme weather events. A series of fascinating original articles follow Sou’s work. We lead with “Tomorrow’s country: practice-oriented principles for Indigenous cultural fire research in south-east Australia” by Andrea Rawluk et al. (2023). The paper models how a group of Indigenous and settler academics, practitioners, and experts have worked to identify a range of practice-oriented principles to support cultural fire management and research. Those principles include trust, reciprocity, and an acknowledgement of power relations and differing values. Consideration is then given by Ryan van den Nouwelant et al. (2023) to crucial questions about “Private rental investment and socio-spatial disadvantage in Sydney, Australia.” The work is based in Sydney, Australia, and focuses on small-scale rental property owners who, over the period from 1991 to 2016, sought high rental yields from low capital outlays. Analysing the spatial correlation between tenure and suburbanisation, the authors show how owners’ actions are linked both to uneven growth rates of private rental and to region’s geographies of social disadvantage. In work by Angus Dowell et al. (2023), readers are next invited to consider “Experimentation as infrastructure: enacting transitions differently through diverse economy-environment assemblages in Aotearoa New Zealand.” Their study deploys social studies of economisation and marketisation (SSEM) to consider economic development initiatives in New Zealand. Importantly, it taps into geographers’ interests in experimentation, agency, and practice in relation to emergent forms of environmental economy. Then, Maria Ribeiro et al. (2023) report on work to understand the “Spatial and temporal dynamics of the urban heat island effect in a small Brazilian city” of Sacramento in western Minas Gerais. Noting how urban growth and climate change are predicted to increase substantial warming in inland cities, they deploy a local climate zone (LCZ) system approach to data about the city’s climate and weather. In the process, they identify factors driving thermal changes and argue that the approach is replicable in other South American cities so that urban planning can account for emergent challenges across the region. Last, Busola Adedokun et al. (2023) document how, on the Central Plateau of Tasmania, there has been “A long entanglement with nature: flyfishers in the wild.” Flyfishers there can be described as having “membership” of groups with varied motivations and attitudes related to their social, trophy, outdoor enthusiast, and hunter-gatherer proclivities. Overarching those differences, however, is a common love of wild nature; a concern for the negative effects of social and environmental challenges such as weeds, dogs, trampling, and fire; and a preparedness to help keep such areas unspoiled. Such qualities suggest they have potential to support park management. As always, thanks to everyone on the team, our board, our reviewers, authors, publisher, and Institute. And that, as they say, is that … until our final issue of 2023, due in November. Until then, stay safe and well.","",https://doi.org/10.1111/1745-5871.12617,"",,
rayyan-210784545,"Combining data from multiple sources for urban travel mode choice
  modelling",,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Demand for sustainable mobility is particularly high in urban areas. Hence, there is a growing need to predict when people will decide to use different travel modes with an emphasis on environmentally friendly travel modes. As travel mode choice (TMC) is influenced by multiple factors, in a growing number of cases machine learning methods are used to predict travel mode choices given respondent and journey features. Typically, travel diaries are used to provide core relevant data. However, other features such as attributes of mode alternatives including, but not limited to travel times, and, in the case of public transport (PT), also walking distances have a major impact on whether a person decides to use a travel mode of interest. Hence, in this work, we propose an architecture of a software platform performing the data fusion combining data documenting journeys with the features calculated to summarise transport options available for these journeys, built environment and environmental factors such as weather conditions possibly influencing travel mode decisions. Furthermore, we propose various novel features, many of which we show to be among the most important for TMC prediction. We propose how stream processing engines and other Big Data systems can be used for their calculation. The data processed by the platform is used to develop machine learning models predicting travel mode choices. To validate the platform, we propose ablation studies investigating the importance of individual feature subsets calculated by it and their impact on the TMC models built with them. In our experiments, we combine survey data, GPS traces, weather and pollution time series, transport model data, and spatial data of the built environment. The growth in the accuracy of TMC models built with the additional features is up to 18.2% compared to the use of core survey data only.","",https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2407.12137,"",,
rayyan-210784546,Geographic Information Systems (GISs) Based on WebGIS Architecture: Bibliometric Analysis of the Current Status and Research Trends,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Geographic information systems (GISs) based on WebGIS architectures have transformed geospatial data visualization and analysis, offering rapid access to critical information and enhancing decision making across sectors. This study conducted a bibliometric review of 358 publications using the Web of Science database. The analysis utilized tools, such as Bibliometrix (version R 4.3.0) and Biblioshiny (version 1.7.5), to study authors, journals, keywords, and collaborative networks in the field of information systems. This study identified two relevant clusters in the literature: (1) voluntary geographic information (VGI) and crowdsourcing, focusing on web integration for collaborative mapping through contributions from non-professionals and (2) GIS management for decision making, highlighting web-based architectures, open sources, and service-based approaches for storing, processing, monitoring, and sharing geo-referenced information. The journals, authors, and geographical distribution of the most important publications were identified. China, Italy, the United States, Germany, and India have excelled in the application of geospatial technologies in areas such as the environment, risk, sustainable development, and renewable energy. These results demonstrate the impact of web-based GISs on forest conservation, climate change, risk management, urban planning, education, public health, and disaster management. Future research should integrate AI, mobile applications, and geospatial data security in areas aligned with sustainable development goals (SDGs) and other global agendas.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/su16156439,"",,
rayyan-210784549,Recent advancements in aquaponics with special emphasis on its sustainability,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract An aquaponic system which is an integration of hydroponics with aquaculture is sustainable, ecologically friendly, and uses non‐renewable resources with very high efficacy. The increasing trend in aquaponics research demonstrates a growing recognition of its potential to address critical global issues such as food security, water conservation, and sustainable agriculture, particularly in regions vulnerable to climate change and resource limitations. It has witnessed remarkable advancements in recent years, with various methods and variations emerging to enhance its functionality and productivity. The purpose of this review is to unify fragmented research on aquaponics and provide a comprehensive resource that emphasizes its potential for broad adoption and successful implementation in varied environments. This review focuses on recent innovations in aquaponic system designs for various climates and examines key advancements in critical areas, including microbial communities, biofiltration, feed management, water quality, and nutrient cycling, emphasizing the interdisciplinary nature of aquaponics. Coupled systems suit moderate climates with high resource efficiency, while decoupled systems offer flexibility across diverse climates by allowing independent control of each component. Innovations such as sandponics, algaeponics, and saline aquaponics address challenges like water scarcity and nutrient efficiency. Smart technologies like IoT and AI are integrated into aquaponics, automating monitoring and nutrient management for better productivity. Emerging areas, including vermi‐aquaponics and flocponics, offer new solutions for nutrient cycling, making aquaponics more efficient, adaptable, and resource‐conserving globally. This paper also examines the sustainability aspects of aquaponics, emphasizing its economic, social, and environmental dimensions. Despite high setup costs and nutrient complexities, aquaponics offers significant potential for sustainable food production by minimizing water use and reducing synthetic fertilizers. Its scalability in both urban and rural areas, along with innovations like vertical systems, presents promising solutions for enhancing agriculture and food security across diverse environments.","",https://doi.org/10.1111/jwas.13116,"",,
rayyan-210784551,A new team and vision of the international social science journal,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Since its inception in 1949 by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), the International Social Science Journal (ISSJ) has sought to strengthen the ties between social science communities globally. Aiming to reach the widest possible audience for over 70 years, the ISSJ uses inter-disciplinary and transdisciplinary approaches to uncover new knowledge, offering an open door for theoretical and applied research. In January 2023, an editorial team composed of scholars from various regions and with backgrounds in different areas of the social sciences was assembled to cooperatively strive for excellence in publishing outstanding works and advance our scholarly and inter-disciplinary knowledge. Baris Cayli Messina, appointed Editor-in-Chief, was accompanied by eight other leading editors: Julie Aitken Schermer, Michael Briguglio, Rowan Gard, Andrea Gatto, Liang Ma, Umer Shahzad, Lexi Webster and Jianzhi Zhao, all established academics in their respective fields who have joined forces to preserve and enhance the International Social Sciences Journal's authoritative stature. As an ambitious new editorial team, we are determined to broaden the scope of the ISSJ and create a promising portfolio of research that addresses the most urgent social, political and cultural issues. With a new editorial agenda, our principal mission is to uphold the highest level of scholarly excellence across all disciplines while also making space for research that presents novel questions and methods for tackling both classic social issues and emerging problems, ultimately having a wider impact on both inside and outside academia. The ISSJ is dedicated to the advancement of social sciences, focusing especially on sociology, criminology, political sciences, economic issues, financial disruptions, environmental studies, media and communication studies, public policy and psychology. We are committed to leveraging our editorial experience to address pressing societal challenges, stimulate new intellectual debates in these areas and shape scholarly discussions in neighbouring disciplines. In the fields of sociology, criminology and political science, there are urgent issues that require closer examination and consideration. These issues range from global-scale concerns, such as climate change, pandemics, armed conflict, different forms of violence, law enforcement, state-sponsored crime, gender inequality and warfare, to different geographical scales, including national, regional and local levels. Sociology is a key discipline for comprehending our everyday lives by analysing social connections that constitute individuals’ lived experiences and form collective behaviours. Additionally, it enables us to identify dissenting voices and unrecognized communities that are often marginalized or excluded in public discourse. Likewise, criminology has become increasingly significant given the expansive use of social control strategies by governments and law enforcement amid the process of globalization. Lastly, politics has always been a field of paramount relevance in response to emerging societal collapses, government forms and widespread questioning of political systems’ legitimacy, which in a decisive manner affect our lives. Recently, the ISSJ has published several critically acclaimed articles on a wide range of subjects and themes, such as prisons and terrorism, group identity (Marone, 2023), political regimes (Vercesi, 2022), democracy and the health and social outcomes of human rights violations (Musabaeva et al., 2022; Sandra, 2022). The research conducted by Selvasundaram et al. (2022) and Diop et al. (2021) revealed the dire consequences of financial development and demonstrated convincingly how economic vulnerability influences the resilience of communities. The ISSJ seeks to persistently publish exceptional articles in the fields of socio-economic issues and finance. Economics, a multifaceted discipline, retains its critical role in driving our economic behaviour and decision-making processes. In addition, wider socio-economic issues and financial disruptions are intricately interlaced with other branches of knowledge, including social history and human geography. From the gender pay gap to global economic crises and poverty, researching these topical matters alongside shocks and crises in many regional markets, applying business cycle analyses and various datasets as well as exploring the health, geopolitical and socioecological origins of economic and financial issues are of great interest to our readers. The scope of the ISSJ encompasses explorations of topics related to environmental studies. Environmental sustainability has become an increasingly important area of concern in the global social science community as the effects of climate change have become more urgent and apparent in recent years, forcing people to take action (Badruzzaman et al., 2023; Saryal, 2022). Although traditional approaches to sustainability often focus on technological and policy developments, emerging research has seen a growing recognition of the importance of incorporating spiritual and artistic dimensions into sustainability efforts to promote a more holistic and effective approach to addressing sustainability challenges and promoting behaviour change. In particular, there has been a growing recognition of the potential benefits of creating a convergence between science and spirituality in promoting sustainable development. The arts can also play an important role in promoting environmental sustainability by engaging communities and inspiring action towards sustainability. Artistic expression can communicate complex ideas and emotions in a way that is accessible and engaging to a wide range of audiences. By creating a consilience between science and spirituality, it is possible to develop more effective and sustainable solutions to environmental problems while also promoting a deeper understanding of the ethical and moral dimensions of sustainability. This can be particularly important when engaging with sustainability issues, which can be complex and abstract. Therefore, we anticipate contributions that present novel visions of potential futures to incite action on environmental and sustainability issues, in the form of literary works, music and visual art. There are urgent scholarly issues that also shape sustainability, such as energy, food security, agricultural production, aquaculture, fisheries, water infrastructures, land and natural resources inequalities, vulnerability, resilience building strategies, challenges posed in poverty alleviation and adaptation processes as well as the definition and measurement of complex associated concepts, such as transition, ecological security and social innovation. Recent publications by the ISSJ (Das, 2022; Mohammed, 2022; Udemba & Yalçıntaş, 2023) have sought to draw attention to the critical challenges of sustainability and food insecurity. These thought-provoking works illuminated the need for long-term perspectives on these issues as well as the worrisome lack of access to basic necessities such as food in many societies around the world. Scholars are invited to reflect on the mounting concerns raised by anthropogenic climate change and global warming. Moreover, new criteria and metrics for environmental evaluation should be sought at both local and international levels, with particular attention given to corporate social responsibility models, environmental management certifications and ESG performance evaluations. In addition, structural changes in rural and urban areas, along with a variety of organizational dynamics across multiple economies, should be examined within the context of human-centric sustainable development initiatives. Our editorial objective also aims to promote the publication of cutting-edge psychological research, both applied and theoretical, that is grounded in its contextual environment, inclusive of diverse perspectives and takes into consideration the international scholarly community. The domain of research actively encourages submissions exploring individual differences and their repercussions on an array of contexts, such as work environments, public welfare, living conditions, emotions, personality, intelligence as well as cross-cultural variations in attitudes and behaviours. The inter-disciplinary exploration of the relationship between media and communication technologies and their embedded contexts is a longstanding focus in both humanities and social sciences research (Pierson, 2022). With ongoing advancements in technology, numerous possibilities exist for future media and communication studies. The ISSJ aims to advance such research endeavours through inclusive publication plans that intend to cover various aspects of technological advancement. These developments raise a number of provocative questions regarding their consequences. For example, public attention surrounding openly accessible large language models has sparked concern regarding social implications, such as datafication, labour market effects and the reinforcement of oppressive societal norms. Furthermore, exploring users’ engagement with emerging media communication technologies offers substantial research prospects, regardless of whether they were intended uses or not. The existence of communicative in/authenticity problems in traditional and new media – like misinformation, disinformation and ‘fake news’ – remains a significant area of development. The emergence of deepfakes and other distortions of reality is a major concern for media and communication scholars. The ISSJ is committed to publishing research on such advances in technology, their effects on users and their implications for the human condition and our existence. However, engaging with these technological advancements is not a requirement for publication; rather, we are open to any media and communications research that advances our methodological or theoretical knowledge. Two recent pioneering articles on the effects of social media and machine learning and the relationship between Internet usage and economic uncertainty were published in the ISSJ (Joshi & Patwardhan, 2023; Nguyen et al., 2023). This exemplary research outputs highlight ISSJ's commitment to furthering inter-disciplinary theory and methods in these fields. We welcome experimentation with and implementation of new analytical approaches and (inter-)disciplinary contextualizations of each traditional, new and future media research. In essence, we intend to publish works at the forefront of our inter-disciplinary field that pushes the boundaries of current to (co-)constructing knowledges. The exploration of data related to public policy in developing countries has recently emerged as a focal point for scholarly discourse. In order to expand the extant knowledge base concerning public policy in such countries and democratize this field beyond a Western perspective, new research using novel data is heavily encouraged. Moreover, the ISSJ pays special attention to studies on global public policy-making processes within international organizations and international non-governmental organizations. The ISSJ regularly publishes research articles on public policy. Recent articles by Ha (2022), Hanif et al. (2022), Mogotsi et al. (2022) and Shkurko (2022) have filled an important void in public policy literature and offered innovative solutions to development issues in the Global South, illustrating our focus on this matter. These articles serve as shining examples of our scholarly priority to mitigate the challenges faced by our global community. This is due to both the historical origins of the journal itself, as well as the pivotal roles that such entities play within developing states’ social policies, public bureaucracies and decision-making procedures. Additionally, although political science, economics and public policy often neglect this area, it is essential to leverage limited publication resources by promoting scholarly works focused on these topics. Finally, authors are encouraged to submit manuscripts proposing and developing new theories of public policy that are applicable in developing countries; such research may offer fresh paradigms for comparison with existing theories designed mainly for developed countries. One of the most important directions of travel for the ISSJ is towards the decolonization of media and communication studies. That is, although we are particularly interested in providing a venue for discussing, exploring and critiquing these advances in media and communication technologies, we are most keen to further the interests of media and communication studies. We contend that decolonization is in the best interest of media and communication research, as it is in research more generally. Magallanes-Blanco (2022: 271) made the case that ‘decolonization of the field implies revisiting the colonial power relations embedded in forms of representation… [being] critical of those representations and [incorporating] those coming from Indigenous thought’. Highlighting underrepresented knowledges – including explicitly challenging cis-heteropatriarchal, white and Western-centric knowledges – in the research we platform is therefore a critical impetus for the ISSJ going forward. In accordance with the inter-disciplinary perspective of the ISSJ, we solicit prospective authors to submit research articles embodying both qualitative and quantitative studies informed by positivistic, interpretative, realist, constructionist, critical or alternative theoretical approaches. This dialogic process should catalyse innovation and novel applications in pursuit of the intellectual aim of the ISSJ, which is to foster inter-disciplinary knowledge on a range of topics while constructing scholarly conversations across multiple disciplines. The ISSJ has an acceptance rate of 13.9% in the last 12 months, rendering it a highly competitive scholarly venue for publication. Though our editorial board is regrettably required to reject numerous admirable papers, we thus seek to supply authors with constructive feedback so that they may revise their articles and submit them to other journals. Through this process, we aspire to propagate research in social science by providing authors with potential pathways to further refine their manuscripts, whether for resubmission to our journal or some alternative outlet. Thus, our endeavour as editors is to provide a platform through the dissemination of high-calibre research from all geographical regions, in order to generate evidence-based knowledge and advance theoretical and methodological perspectives on social phenomena associated with human conditions, organizational structures and collective behaviour. Henceforth, the ISSJ has an inclusive and multifaceted research approach and encourages intellectual contributions from varied perspectives and traditions in social science research. We look forward to receiving rigorous scholarly submissions that foreground pluralistic, holistic and polycentric orientations. We are also devoted to amplifying the perspectives of marginalized groups and those from underrepresented scholarly backgrounds. The ISSJ will continue facilitating research that questions existing power dynamics while aiming to explore social, political and cultural transformation in our ever-evolving world. Ultimately, we strive to publish papers of high scholastic calibre that further our social science knowledge both theoretically and methodologically.","",https://doi.org/10.1111/issj.12443,"",,
rayyan-210784556,Ocean Sustainability,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"With over 70% of the Earth covered by oceans, humans have had an intricate relationship with oceans for thousands of years. They have been vital in the development of humanity and sustain us to this day. But now, our oceans are under threat across all scales. These threats are complex. Climate change is a unifying driver of many hazards—from the melting of the ice caps threatening sea levels to elevated sea temperatures, leading to mass coral reef bleaching. Overfishing and pollution have also further pushed stressed ecosystems to the brink. Therefore, living with our oceans sustainably is crucial. Cell Reports Sustainability recently attended the Ocean Sciences Meeting 2024, where the world's leading experts in ocean-related sciences presented their latest research. It is well known that only about 5% of our oceans have been explored and mapped with much still to discover. To begin to understand how to live sustainably with our oceans, we need this fundamental research. In our February issue, we published a paper by Mitch Lyons and colleagues, providing updated maps of global coral reef spatial coverage at a high resolution. Quantifying the current state of our marine ecosystems is one vital step in comprehending the impacts of climate change, fishing, and the resulting sustainability challenges. Approximately 40% of the global population live in coastal areas. These areas can face compounding hazards such as sea level rise and climate extreme events. Some cities like New Orleans, where the Ocean Sciences Meeting 2024 was held, are also subsiding, and thus further raising the potential hazard. In 2005, Hurricane Katrina exposed the devastating consequences of structural inequality in areas of New Orleans in which low-income communities and people of color were the most vulnerable to flooding generated by the hurricane. As progress is made with technical and nature-based solutions to sea level rise and flooding, justice must be at the heart of these sustainable solutions. While most of us will rarely, if ever, go out into the open ocean, our lifestyles on land directly impact them. Our rivers discharge our rubbish, waste, and chemical pollutants. Microplastics have made their way to the deepest parts of oceans. Polluting, supersized cargo ships circle the globe, carrying everything from food to cars to Legos for our every need and desire. We cannot isolate impacts in the oceans from actions on land. At Cell Reports Sustainability, we call for papers that span the broad remit of ocean sustainability research, from the state of marine ecosystems and the impacts of climate change to the solutions and policy needed. New global area estimates for coral reefs from high-resolution mappingLyons et al.Cell Reports SustainabilityFebruary 13, 2024In BriefLyons et al. present statistics and trends derived from globally consistent, high-resolution maps of shallow coral reefs. They revise the global area of shallow corals reefs to 348,361 km², including 80,213 km² of coral habitat. Leveraging 1.5 million+ samples curated from 480+ data contributors and 100 trillion pixels from satellite imagery, this work integrates machine learning and coral reef science. Accessible publicly on the Allen Coral Atlas and Google Earth Engine, the data empower global efforts in coral reef conservation, management, and research.

rayyan-210784558,An improved estimation of remote sensing-based ecological index for tracking continuous changes in eco-environmental quality,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Remote sensing-based ecological index (RSEI) is a widely used index for monitoring eco-environmental quality (EEQ). However, the traditional estimations usually face poor stability in tracking the continuous EEQ changes. To overcome this issue, this study introduces an improved framework for RSEI estimation to enhance the temporal comparability of EEQ assessments. It incorporates annual mean values and temporal normalization of key ecological indicators to address limitations, including susceptibility to seasonal variability and reliance on single-phase data. Through applying to Liangshan Prefecture, a mountainous region in Southwest China, the improved RSEI captures both long-term trends and short-term ecological dynamics from 2001 to 2020, revealing relatively stable EEQ, with mean values ranging from 0.465–0.470. Regions experiencing significant improvement or degradation accounted for less than 10% of the total area. Environmental improvements were largely attributed to human disturbance reduction and ecological restoration projects in high-altitude areas, while degraded regions were concentrated in the Anning River Valley, driven by population growth and urban expansion, affecting 51% of the area. The assessments demonstrate that the improved method shows greater stability and spatial coherence than the traditional ones, providing a robust metric for tracking EEQ trends for environmental monitoring and sustainable development planning.","",https://doi.org/10.1080/17538947.2024.2445625,"",,
rayyan-210784563,Efficiency and Accuracy in GPR-Based Tree Root Assessment: A Comparative Analysis of Scanning Patterns,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"The growing importance of monitoring and preserving natural resources underscores the need for effective tree root assessment, particularly in the context of sustainable urban planning and ecosystem management. Tree roots, vital yet elusive plant organs, pose a significant challenge for accurate evaluation [1]. Ground-penetrating radar (GPR) has emerged as a valuable tool in this regard. Recent applications have focused on developing methodologies for tree root assessment in challenging conditions, such as the use of frequency-based spectrogram imagery for the assessment of urban trees [2], and the use of deep learning methods for the automatic recognition of tree roots [3]. Acknowledging the critical role of tree roots and the challenges associated with their assessment, the need for a method that balances precision with practicality needs to be addressed. To this end, this study presents a comparative analysis of two distinct scanning patterns&amp;#8212;semi-circular and grid-shaped&amp;#8212;to evaluate their efficiency and accuracy in GPR-based tree root assessment. The methodology involved a data collection around a lime tree using both scanning patterns. The semi-circular scanning pattern, known for its detailed data acquisition, was contrasted with the grid-shaped pattern, which offers a potentially more time-efficient and practical alternative. The datasets were then subjected to thorough analysis, encompassing root detection, resolution, and overall efficacy. This comparative analysis contributes to informing practitioners and researchers about the compromises between detailed root insights and the practical constraints of time and resources. The results of this study not only contribute to the optimisation of GPR-based tree root assessments but also aid in decision-making for urban planners and arborists seeking a balance between precision and efficiency in managing urban green spaces. &amp;#160; Acknowledgements The Authors would like to express their sincere thanks and gratitude to the following trusts, charities, organisations and individuals for their generosity in supporting this project: Lord Faringdon Charitable Trust, The Schroder Foundation, Cazenove Charitable Trust, Ernest Cook Trust, Sir Henry Keswick, Ian Bond, P.

rayyan-210784568,Learning from the past to shape the future. Harnessing multi-scale human data and earth observations to foster sustainable water usage and societal adaptation to climate change,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Human-water feedbacks have been increasingly studied in the last decades, motivating the foundation of new disciplines such as socio-hydrology and, in general, enhanced interest toward conceptualization and modelling of the spatial and temporal dynamics of human-water systems. With anthropogenic activities being widely recognized as a major driver of global change and the human population being increasingly exposed to hydroclimatic extreme events, human systems are now at the forefront of the water cycle. Yet, human preferences, behaviors, and decisions in relation to water systems - including water usage dynamics, adoption of precautionary measures against climate extremes, and adaptation of urban landscapes - are often modelled based on behavioral or economic theories, or derived from small-scale samples. This often leads to heterogeneous results, which are often case-specific, or lack validation against real-world observations. The availability of increasingly fine-resolution data from distributed sensors and databases (e.g., water consumption data from intelligent meters, flood insurance adoption records at the household level, and socio-demographic data) and earth observations (e.g., aerial and satellite imagery) provides us with an empirical basis to model heterogeneous individual and societal behavioral patterns, along with their determinants. In my research, I strive to develop multi-disciplinary data-driven behavioral modelling approaches that bridge hydrologic/hydraulic sciences, informatics, economics, and systems engineering and harness information from multi-scale human data and earth observations and the power of data analytics and machine learning to better understand, model, and characterize human behaviors in coupled human-water systems. In this talk, I will first provide an overview of recent advances in descriptive behavioral modelling in human-water systems, with a focus on household-to-continental scale modelling of residential water consumption patterns and adoption of household flood insurance. Second, I will elaborate on modelling challenges that are motivating ongoing research related to machine learning-based behavioral models, including model explainability, data and computational requirements, generalization and scalability, and the influence of data resolution in time and space. Finally, I will discuss how developing descriptive models that learn human behaviors retrospectively can be used to inform forecasting tasks and formulate policy-relevant recommendations to shape future societal adaptation to climate change. Implications span from informing the design of feedback-based digital user engagement in pursuit of water conservation, to fostering proactive climate adaptation, addressing societal inequalities and heterogeneous water access and affordability conditions, or evaluating incentive programs and policies for sustainable urban development.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu24-19445,"",,

Foreword Prof. Walter Leal Filho (PhD, DSc, DPhil, DTech, DEd) Chair, Inter-University Sustainable Development Research Programme The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in September 2015 provide a universal call to action to end poverty, protect the planet and ensure that by 2030 all people enjoy peace and prosperity. They also entail elements of importance towards a strategic business engagement with sustainability issues. These offer a framework which provides businesses with a systematic approach to identify new business opportunities whilst contributing to the solution of the grand sustainability challenges facing the world today, including climate change. Each SDG, if achieved, will have a direct and significant positive impact on millions of people's lives around the world and the environment in which they live. Businesses have an opportunity to widen the purpose of business through adopting the SDGs as targets for their operations. Thus, they can make a meaningful contribution to the greater good through achieving their operational objectives. Family businesses are uniquely placed to contribute to SDGs for many reasons. Firstly, because family business models have longer time perspectives, and this allows the family business to link with the longer term SDG time frame – 2030. Second, family businesses often focus on aspects of business operation which do not have an immediate return on investment such as relationship building with stakeholder groups. Thirdly, family businesses tend to rate the importance of ethics higher than standard businesses and thus align well with the social dimensions of the SDGs. Lastly, family businesses have intergenerational perspectives which is a core principle of sustainability. This book provides insights into how family business operationalises SDG#5: Gender Equality. This book uses a rigorous case study approach for family businesses to detail aspects of their business which help to advance gender equality. The cases provided here are living proof that the family business that operate for the greater good actually work! Non-family businesses can take a leaf out of the family businesses portrayed in this book as they can provide different perspectives on how businesses can successfully align SDGs and business strategy. Despite many businesses having adopted environmental social governance strategies and environmental management systems, the effect of this activity has not been reflected in a healthier planet. Many ‘state of the environment’ reports indicate that planetary health is decreasing, and planetary boundaries are being crossed or are about to be crossed. Whilst the cause of this decline is not entirely the fault of business, there still needs to be a greater effort to address the decline. The challenge for family businesses is to use their unique characteristics and set ambitious programmes of work that make a meaningful contribution to achieving global goals. This book provides insights into how family businesses can achieve such a mission and how non-family businesses can be inspired to do the same. Acknowledgements The Editors would like to thank the contributors of the book for providing insights and sharing learnings from their business practice. We acknowledge that writing up cases in the format required considerable time and effort. The quality of the cases presented is testament to their efforts. The Editors would also like to thank Emerald Publishing for supporting the publication of this book and the mission for deeper sustainability through utilising the SDGs. 1Reddrop, A. (2012).

rayyan-210784578,"Impact of Land Use/Cover Change on Soil Erosion and Future Simulations in Hainan Island, China",,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Soil erosion (SE) is a critical threat to the sustainable development of ecosystem stability, agricultural productivity, and human society in the context of global environmental and climate change. Particularly in tropical island regions, due to the expansion of human activities and land use/cover changes (LUCCs), the risk of SE has been exacerbated. Combining the RUSLE with machine learning methods, SE spatial patterns, their driving forces and the mechanisms of how LUCCs affect SE, were illustrated. Additionally, the potential impacts of future LUCCs on SE were simulated by using the PLUS model. The main results are as follows: (1) Due to LUCCs, the average soil erosion modulus (SEM) decreased significantly from 108.09 t/(km2·a) in 2000 to 106.75 t/(km2·a) in 2020, a reduction of 1.34 t/(km2·a), mainly due to the transformation of cropland to forest and urban land. (2) The dominant factor affecting the spatial pattern of SE is the LS factor (with relative contributions of 43.9% and 45.17%), followed by land use/cover (LUC) (the relative contribution is 28.46% and 34.89%) in 2000 and 2020, respectively. (3) Three kinds of future scenarios simulation results indicate that the average SEM will decrease by 2.40 t/(km2·a) under the natural development scenario and by 1.86 t/(km2·a) under the ecological protection scenario by 2060. However, under the cropland protection scenario, there is a slight increase in SEM, with an increase of 0.08 t/(km2·a). Sloping cropland erosion control remains a primary issue for Hainan Island in the future.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/w16182654,"",,

However, a comprehensive analysis exploring the relationships between LULCC, and its explanatory variables remains unexplored. This study focused on the Lake Kivu catchment in Rwanda, analysing LULCC from 1990 to 2020, identifying major variables, and predicting future LULC scenarios under different development trajectories. Image classification was conducted in Google Earth Engine using random forest classifier, by incorporating seasonal composites Landsat images, spectral indices, and topographic features, to enhance discrimination and capture seasonal variations. The results demonstrated an overall accuracy exceeding 83%. Historical analysis revealed significant changes, including forest loss (26.6 to 18.7%) and agricultural land expansion (27.7 to 43%) in the 1990–2000 decade, attributed to political conflicts and population movements. Forest recovery (24.8% by 2020) was observed in subsequent decades, driven by Rwanda’s sustainable development initiatives. A Multi-Layer Perceptron neural network from Land Change Modeler predicted distinct 2030 and 2050 LULC scenarios based on natural, socio-economic variables, and historical transitions. Analysis of explanatory variables highlighted the significant role of proximity to urban centers, population density, and terrain in LULCC. Predictions indicate distinct trajectories influenced by demographic and socio-economic trends. The study recommends adopting the Green Growth Economy scenario aligned with ongoing conservation measures. The findings contribute to identifying opportunities for land restoration and conservation efforts, promoting the preservation of Lake Kivu catchment’s ecological integrity, in alignment with national and global goals.

rayyan-210784592,Navigating Ecological–Economic Interactions: Spatiotemporal Dynamics and Drivers in the Lower Reaches of the Jinsha River,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"The lower reaches of the Jinsha River, serving as a vital ecological barrier in southwestern China and playing a crucial role in advancing targeted poverty alleviation efforts, remain underexplored in terms of the coupling between ecological and economic development, creating a gap in understanding the region’s sustainable development potential. This study combines the remote sensing ecological index (RSEI) derived from MODIS data and the biodiversity richness index (BRI) based on land use data to create the ecological environment index (EEI) using a weighted approach. It also develops the economic development index (EDI) from economic data using the entropy weight method. By integrating the EEI and EDI, the study calculates key metrics, including the ecological–economic coupling degree (EECD), coupling coordination degree (EECCD), and relative development degree (EERDD), and examines their spatiotemporal changes from 2000 to 2020. Additionally, the study applies a geographic detector model to identify the spatial drivers of the EEI, an obstacle factor diagnosis model to pinpoint the main barriers to EDI, and a neural network model to uncover the underlying forces shaping EECCD. The results indicate that: (I) From 2000 to 2020, the overall improvement rate of the ecological and economic subsystems was greater than that of the ecological–economic coupling system. The entire region is still in the Running-In Stage, and the coordination level has been upgraded from near imbalance to marginal coordination. About 85% of the counties’ EERDDs are still in the EDI Behind EEI Stage. (II) The structural composition of the EEI shows a pattern of low Dry Hot Valley Area and high in other areas, mainly driven by natural factors, although human activities had a notable impact on these interactions. (III) Originating from an impact model primarily driven by economic factors and supplemented by ecological factors, both EDI and EECCD exhibit a pattern of high in the south and low in the north, with improvements spreading northward from the urban area of Kunming. The development gradient differences between 24 poverty-stricken counties and 16 non-poverty-stricken counties have been reduced. (IV) For the six types of ecological–economic coupling development zones, it is essential to adopt localized approaches tailored to the differences in resource and environmental characteristics and development stages. Key efforts should focus on enhancing ecological protection and restoration, increasing financial support, implementing ecological compensation mechanisms, and promoting innovative models for sustainable development.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/land13122159,"",,
rayyan-210784595,Gene Identification and Map Construction of the Production &amp;minus; Living &amp;minus; Ecological Space in Traditional Villages in the Li River Basin,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"<sec><title>Objective</title> Traditional villages in the Li River Basin are key cultural heritage assets, representing the historical evolution of local societies, architectural traditions, and the complex interactions between human activities and natural landscapes. These villages, which exhibit distinct spatial patterns and cultural expressions, are central to understanding rural cultural landscapes in China. However, rapid urbanization has intensified pressures on these villages, resulting in challenges such as spatial homogenization, functional decline, and disordered development, all of which contribute to the erosion of the unique spatial characteristics of such villages. To address these critical issues, this research aims to identify and analyze the spatial genes of traditional villages in the Li River Basin. By constructing a comprehensive framework that integrates production, living, and ecological spaces, the research seeks to provide a theoretical foundation for the conservation, adaptive reuse, and sustainable management of these traditional landscapes within the broader framework of national and regional territorial spatial planning. </sec><sec><title>Methods</title> The research employs an innovative mixed-methods approach that combines deep learning techniques, spatial feature quantification, and extensive field investigations. A comprehensive spatial information database is developed, drawing information from multiple sources such as remote sensing imagery, historical documents, architectural surveys, and field observations. This database serves as the foundation for spatial analysis, facilitating the identification of spatial genes using a deep learning model, the Dual Attention Network (DANet). The model is designed to enhance spatial feature extraction through a combination of spatial and channel attention mechanisms, with a view to enabling more precise identification of spatial characteristics. The research categorizes spatial genes into three main types: Production space, living space, and ecological space. Production space mainly involves the forms of farmland and the relationship between village and farmland, reflecting the close integration of village with agricultural land. Living space encompasses settlement scale, settlement morphology, and road network patterns. Ecological space includes terrain type, landform type, village – mountain relationship, and village – water relationship, emphasizing the spatial relationship between village location and natural elements like mountains and water. The research also constructs a detailed spatial gene map that visually represents the organization and integration of production, living, and ecological spaces within traditional villages, providing insights into the dynamic interactions among these elements. </sec><sec><title>Results</title> The research identifies 32 distinct spatial gene types across traditional villages in the Li River Basin, which are systematically categorized into four main village types based on their spatial gene combinations and adaptation strategies. The first type, Surrounding Solitary Peak Village, is typically located in low-elevation karst landscapes, characterized by a circular spatial layout around isolated peaks and close proximity to water sources. These villages exhibit a strategic use of natural terrain, enabling effective agricultural production and compact living environments that are adapted to local topography. The second type, Peak Forest Depression Village, is found in hilly and plain karst areas. These villages feature compact living spaces but more dispersed production areas, reflecting adaptations to limited ecological space and a strong reliance on local natural resources. The third type, River Valley Plain Village, is situated along river valleys and plains, with residential and production spaces closely aligned with water channels. These villages often serve as commercial centers with well-developed waterway networks, demonstrating a functional balance between agricultural production and trade activities. The fourth type, Mountainous Hill Village, is located at higher elevations and characterized by stepped terraces, tiered housing, and adaptive land use patterns that integrate with the steep terrain. These villages employ innovative land management strategies, such as contour farming and hillside construction, to maximize the use of available land while maintaining ecological balance. The spatial gene map constructed in this research offers a comprehensive visualization of the spatial organization and integration patterns within these villages, highlighting how different types of traditional villages maintain a balance among production, living, and ecological spaces. The map also reveals varying adaptation strategies shaped by local geographic, cultural, and economic factors, providing valuable insights into the sustainability of traditional village landscapes. </sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title> This research makes significant contributions to traditional village research by introducing an innovative framework for spatial gene identification and analysis, specifically focusing on the Li River Basin. Through the systematic classification of spatial genes into production, living, and ecological spaces, the research not only refines the theoretical understanding of traditional village landscapes, but also provides practical guidance for their conservation and revitalization. The use of the DANet deep learning model enhances the objectivity, precision, and efficiency of spatial gene identification and mapping, thereby establishing a comprehensive spatial gene database. The spatial gene map constructed in this research effectively visualizes the interactions and combination patterns of spatial elements, offering clear insights into the strategies for classification and sustainable development of villages. The findings underscore the need to harmonize traditional spatial characteristics with modern development requirements, advocating for a balanced integration of historical heritage within the context of contemporary societal demands. By supporting policy formulation aligned with territorial spatial governance and regional planning, this research contributes to the sustainable development of traditional villages, as well as the preservation of cultural identity and the accommodation of modern needs. </sec>","",https://doi.org/10.3724/j.fjyl.202402130091,"",,
rayyan-210784605,Urban Management in Authoritarian China: How the Smart City is Used to Enhance Comprehensive Law Enforcement,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"ABSTRACT'Comprehensive law enforcement' is an important part of the Chinese Communist Party's (CCP's) thinking on urban management. It involves all government departments and units related to law enforcement working together to improve their administrative efficiency. Since 2009, the CCP has absorbed some elements of the Western concept of the 'smart city', including the use of big data analysis and technology in implementing and enforcing the law. At the heart of the Chinese smart city is the 'city brain'. For the CCP regime, the primary purpose of the smart city is to monitor society and improve the efficiency of urban management; making life more convenient for residents is a secondary consideration. In other words, this mechanism is strongly state led in nature, and it is aimed at ensuring the regime's survival by strengthening the CCP's capacity to govern. We found that due to incentives built into the cadre evaluation system, grassroots officials use the information gathered through smart city technology to achieve 'hard' law enforcement targets rather to improve people's lives.KEYWORDS: cadre evaluation systemcomprehensive law enforcementcity brainsmart cityurban management AcknowledgmentsWe thank the editor and reviewers for their suggestions.

Half Title Page Destination Conscience Series Title Page New Perspectives in Tourism and Hospitality Management Series Editor: Marco Valeri New Perspectives in Tourism and Hospitality Management positions organisational change and behaviour in the tourism and hospitality sector at its heart, providing interdisciplinary research in this field and joining the areas of organisational studies and tourism/hospitality management. After years of disruption the tourism and hospitality sector is an increasingly important area of study, encompassing topics such as sustainability, the environment, climate change, terrorism, cultural studies and more. New trends, challenges and developments, as well as the application of new ideas that are likely to affect the tourism and hospitality industry are analysed with a particular focus on organisational behaviour, responsible management and governance, sustainability and ecotourism. New Perspectives in Tourism and Hospitality Management provides alternative philosophies for organisational change and development in hospitality. It encourages the exploration of philosophies including critical theory and is interested in qualitative and quantitative analyses of change management and change practices in touristic destinations and organisations.

rayyan-210784627,Regulatory culture and architectural project,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"In architecture, the dialectics between regulation and design belong to a very broad field of objects, tools, characteristics, performance, relations and behaviours. It is necessary to refer to these aspects in defining prefigurative, design or management actions in interventions on the built environment. In general, regulations establish a system of values to which they can be compared, starting from a theoretical and methodological field, and then moving on to areas ranging from knowledge to the effects on the territories. Unlike the rule, which provides its meaning in the act of observing it, the regulation has a dual aspect. The first concerns an imperative and precept formulation, the second the reference to custom or practice. Hence, it oscillates between binding prescription and non-binding information levels or recommendations. Through the regulatory action, architecture has constantly strived to remove itself from arbitrary conditions. Normative frameworks define principles and rules, including both unplanned ones, as well as decision support tools like manuals and technical information, specifications and regulations. These standards manage various aspects of control and management of the multiple qualities of architecture. Within the building process, the standard finally expresses the collective needs to define a regulatory mechanism capable of avoiding conflicts between various subjects, needs and instances. The evolution of normative culture has shifted from a system of objective regulations, aimed at defining characteristics and functions of specific building objects to rationalise what exists, to more flexible regulations that are predominantly suggestions for performance. These performance standards focus on meeting specific spatial, technical and environmental requirements an ‘object’ must provide at the moment of its use. They are attentive to a quality that does not depend on construction solutions or on techno-typological, morphological or physical-chemical characteristics, but which is linked to a system of needs to be satisfied, the outcome of the interaction between construction and cultural, socio-economic and environmental context. Today’s regulatory landscape has expanded, increasing sensitivities to environmental challenges, health and the qualities of living space. There has been a shift from regulation through standards and deterministic technical-constructive prescriptions to performance standards and a regulatory space, which is more open today, and which interacts with emerging issues. In our country, university research on regulatory culture has long featured the technological culture of design, production and building processes, with the contribution of numerous theoretical and applicative studies. In the most recent concepts, approaches based on sets of measurable indicators and application criteria are being successfully explored through the verification of compliance with reference values, predetermined requirements and objectives to be achieved. This allows a greater interest on process results and spin-offs, and not only on the qualities of the output produced. Today, the implementation of sustainability issues has widened the scope to directives, laws, standards and certifications. The relationship between design and regulations is developed with a broad reference to the multiple levels of standardisation according to mechanisms such as those expressed by the operational sequence of European directives for member states to which national laws must conform, progressively assuming levels of cogency. In recent years, the framework of legislative devices has been given considerable impetus by the advancement of issues on the quality of design and construction, as well as on the protection of the environment and people’s health. Finally, the regulation of the management of urban and housing complexity has opened up the field to both general and detailed standardisation processes. Additionally, in recent years, the energy, climate and geopolitical emergencies have generated a highly articulated chain of regulations, both guideline and mandatory. The important ministerial action of reorganising regulatory devices was also implemented by bringing specific specialised regulations within general frameworks (such as the Consolidated Text on Construction, the legislative device on urban regeneration or land consumption). On a national level, plans and programmes, which can potentially be identified as guidelines for executive planning, have become increasingly important. An example is provided by what will be the transition from the recently adopted – on 22.12.2023 – PNACC – Piano Nazionale di Adattamento ai Cambiamenti Climatici (National Climate Change Adaptation Plan) to the implementation of climate adaptation strategies and actions to be developed at regional and local scales. Another level of standardisation concerns addresses, guidelines and performance standards defined within ministerial calls for tenders. Innovation concerning such calls is also emphasised in the effects on territories. In this case, the regulatory scenario gives value to the process, rather than to the product-project alone. The PINQuA – Programma Innovativo Nazionale per la Qualità dell’Abitare (National Innovative Programme for the Quality of Living) provides a significant example of this aspect. In fact, the innovative elements in this programme include the introduction of a rewarding approach based on results and performance measured through criteria that, going beyond the conventional evaluation referring only to the project output, focus on the effects and fallouts of complex integrated actions. The theme of guidelines and checklists for public bodies is a type of standardisation to support decision-making through various stages such as control, verification, validation, feasibility and congruence. The emphasis on qualifying the products of activities related to the new scenarios introduced by the PNRR, the National Recovery and Resilience Plan, deserves attention for several aspects. One notable aspect is the adoption of the regulating principle of ‘do no significant harm’ (DNHS), along with the choice to link together the numerous intervention proposals aimed at implementing structural and lasting changes in the built environment, both in terms of implementation and methodology. Cognitive, simulative or prefigurative activities are oriented in their feasibility and compliance with preliminary requirements and measurable effects, framed in a circular vision with feedback processes. Currently, there is a great push towards environmental standards, extended in a multi-scalar approach that includes multiple aspects ranging from urban regeneration to certification and CAM – Minimum Environmental Criteria. Finally, a specific discourse should be made on the European directives that play a relevant role in defining ‘frameworks’, as in the case of the directives “Case green”, “Fit for 55” or even “REPowerEU”, within which the implementing regulatory frameworks must be defined. The above reveals a more integrated relationship between numerous systems and levels of standardisation, characterised by varying scalar approaches and different procedural components and sequences. Hence, the theme “Project and Standard” brings the focus of the TECHNE journal back to the aspect of the project. In its component of architectural culture, technical thinking, procedure and process-related implementation, with regard to the standard, the project must be included in a circular process with numerous moments of interaction and validation, which pose important issues that can be framed in the relationship between regulatory updates and levels of controlled simplification by introducing guiding strategies and greater flexibility.","",https://doi.org/10.36253/techne-16053,"",,
rayyan-210784661,2023: A year of success in the climate change battle or a missed opportunity?,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"From 30 November to 12 December 2023, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) 28th Conference of the Parties (COP28) was held in the United Arab Emirates. This World Climate Action Summit brought together 154 Heads of State and Government. In the very final stage of the Summit, the Parties reached several important agreements including operationalization of the loss and damage fund reinforcing the role of children and youth as agents of change through the Presidency youth climate champion, to operationalizing the transition from the fossil fuel use, emissions cuts, and scaled-up financing arrangements (United Nations COP 28, 2024). According to many observers and commentators, the agreements, which aim at more decisive climate action before the end of the decade to keep the global temperature limit of 1.5°C, imply recognition that global greenhouse gas emissions need to be cut 43% by 2030, compared to 2019 levels, to achieve that goal. This includes accelerating efforts towards the phase-down of unabated coal power, phasing out inefficient fossil fuel subsidies, and other measures that drive the transition away from fossil fuels in energy systems. The direction towards more equitable development, with developed countries continuing to take the lead, is suggested as the path to achieving those ambitious goals, and if possible, closer to 2025 (1 year from now!). Other researchers note that the urgent phasing out of fossil fuels is necessary but not sufficient. Mazzucato et al. (2023) consider that even if we could decarbonize the economy tomorrow, we would still not have a sustainable future until we take steps to maintain water systems and natural habitats. The authors argue that there is scientific evidence that ""nature loss on its own can send us crashing through the Paris climate agreement's target of limiting global warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels, ushering in a world where millions of people in vulnerable environments would no longer be able to adapt"". Further, ""(t)he increasingly well-documented links between climate change, biodiversity loss, and water insecurity point to a fundamental issue: our economic systems are based on flawed thinking. We are forever reacting to market failures when we should be pursuing proactive strategies to shape the economy for the common good"" (Ibid). We have called attention to the major connections of water with the sustainable development process and goals, from our very first Editorial in 2014 (Neto & Camkin, 2014) to the central role of water in adapting to climate change in 2023 (Camkin & Neto, 2023). Safeguarding water resources and biodiversity cannot be done without decarbonization. The unbalanced way water and its resources have been used everywhere, within a frame of uncontrolled exhaustion of the environment and the services it provides, has undoubtedly contributed to the intensification of climatic extremes. 2023 was the hottest year on record (EC, 2023), with critical rising temperatures, serious fires in many countries, and floods in many regions. In 2023, we saw how all these extremes are having an increasing impact on already vulnerable populations, and communities, making more people homeless and increasing the number of climate refugees. Amongst the gloom, there is lots of positive action. In Europe, for example, the European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS) were enforced from 1st January 2024, obligating all companies to report water risks across their operations and value chains. This mandatory reporting on water aims to help companies understand (1) the material risks and opportunities arising from their dependence on water; (2) the impacts a company's activities may have on water resources; and (3) the actions a company is taking to prevent negative impacts and contribute to broader EU water objectives (ESRS, 2023). Of course, no single action is enough to match the huge and intrinsically interconnected challenges; water-related issues can no longer be ignored in any context. The challenge is not small, or dispensable. The water cycle, its territorial links, the environment, economic uses and resources, governance—in a word—require competence and strategic vision. Both are not abundant, unfortunately, which demands multiplied efforts from the real agents for change. Given the scale of climate changes and their effects, the latest COP 28 can bring some light to the path. But it is not an entirely optimistic outlook when we look at what is effectively happening. Actors around the world cry for clearer actions for decarbonization, but sadly, many of the fossil fuel-based activities continue to be supported and strongly financed in many regions, despite the Paris Agreement and the final decisions of the Conference of the Parties in Dubai at the end of last year. As pointed out by several agencies, many countries ""are still aiming at peaking their fossil fuel use in the next years, … and countries that have ratified and agreed upon the European Union targets and the new EU Directives, still subsidize fossil fuels"" (Oikonomou, 2023). For example, in Greece, three environmental organizations have filed a formal complaint to the European Commission against Greece for systematically giving a free pass to oil and gas drilling off the Greek coasts, in breach of EU and national laws. Because COP28 was so important, we have invited Sarah Ransom, General Manager of the Australian Water Partnership, to write a Guest Editorial for this issue, entitled Returning from Dubai: Reflections on Water in the Climate Conference. Sarah provides many relevant insights into the realities of COP28, building upon her experience of also attending previous COPs. Sarah concludes that ""there is an opportunity ahead for the water community to make a significant contribution both to the fight for 1.5°C, and to ensure our skills and knowledge help communities and ecosystems to build resilience and adapt where needed, following the UN call for the water professionals to play a part on climate action in this critical decade."" The next 18 papers deal with a wide range of water issues, all linked to the need to improve the connection between research, policy, practice, and learning, particularly in the rapidly changing global context. In the paper, Is the Media Missing the Point on the Transnational American Desalination Pipe Dream? Brian F. O'Neill uses the example of large-scale seawater desalination in the southwest USA and Mexico to explore the role that media plays in the dissemination of information about globally significant transboundary issues like water policy and infrastructure projects. Drawing on experiences from Kazakhstan and elsewhere, Nurlan Apakhayev and co-authors report on their investigation into criminal offenses relating to water bodies and propose the development of new strategies and programs aimed at countering such crimes in Problems of Prevention of Criminal Offenses Related to the Use of Water Resources. Water quality management features strongly in this issue of WWP. Taking into consideration both the environmental limits specified by Egyptian legislation and industry-specific parameters, Doaa Abdou and Eid El—Ragehy propose an Industrial Water Quality Index in Unlocking Solutions for Cleaner Waters: The Industrial Wastewater Quality Index (IWQI) in Egypt and Beyond. In a book review Exploring Groundwater-Climate Change Interactions: A Critical Review of Groundwater and Climate Change: Multi-Level Law and Policy Perspectives by Philippe Cullet, Kulsum Fatima examines the key arguments presented, critically analyzing the book's contribution to the field of environmental law and policy, particularly relating to the interactions between climate change and groundwater. Returning to North America, Holly Wilts, David Burton and Aitazaz Farooque discuss the efficacy of various riparian buffer zone configurations and identify optimal buffers to protect surface water from contamination in A Comparison of Riparian Buffer Designs Incorporating Short-rotation Salix viminalis to Mitigate Surface Water Pollution in the Dunk River Watershed on Prince Edward Island. In Rainfall Extremes and Trends During the Little Dry Season in Nigeria, Joseph Omoniyi Adejuwon then presents an analysis of the ""little dry season"" in Nigeria—a dry spell amid the wet season—which is a phenomenon of interest in West Africa because of its impacts on agriculture and food production. Vishal Narain and Chanda Goodrich analyze the reasons for the limited impact of efforts for gender mainstreaming in the water sector in South Asia in their discussion paper, Glass Half Empty or Half Full? Gender in Integrated Water Resource Management in South Asia, noting that reserving seats for women in local patriarchal structures of decision-making does little to alter the status quo. Taking lessons from the experiences of riparian countries such as the Mekong River and common legal frameworks on international water law, Hoa Thanh Ha and Tuan Van Vu discuss the urgent need to establish a specialized international water management commission in their paper Urgent Call for Protection and Use of Transboundary Watercourses. Some Legal Reflections. Noting that rapid and frequent mapping of flood areas is crucial for monitoring and mitigating flood disasters, Sainath Reddy Poli and R. Bhavani's paper Assessment of Flood in Nandigama, Andhra Pradesh, Using Hydrological and Hydraulic Models reports on flood inundation mapping in Nandigama and its implications for the planning and management of flood control infrastructure. With soil erosion being a big challenge in Ethiopia due to the high expansion of agricultural activity and poor land-use management, Eyasu Tafese Mekuria's paper Sediment Yield Assessment and Suggesting Mitigation Measures: A Case Study of Deme Watershed, Omo-Gibe Basin, Ethiopia reports on sediment yield assessments and suggests mitigation measures that could reduce sediment yield by up to 90%. Amit Kumar Sharma and co-authors address the increasingly popular use of bio-indicators in water resource management in their article A Review on Plankton as a Bio-indicator: A Promising Tool for Monitoring Water Quality, highlighting recent research on the opportunities a range of planktons present for water quality management. Continuing with the water quality theme, the article Evaluating the Structures and Arrangements of Water Institutions to Include In-stream Modelling for Water Quality Management and Control Pollution: Insights from the Awash Basin, Ethiopia by Eskinder Zinabu and co-authors critically analyses existing models and the supporting environment, and suggest changes needed to improve institutional capacity. In their paper, Severity of Natural Calamities and Crop Yield Prediction Using Hybrid Deep Learning Model in Uttar Pradesh, Rajneesh Kumar and Rajendra Prasad Mahapatra discuss weaknesses in methods of predicting crop yields and propose approaches that better incorporate natural calamities such as drought, hail, and storm severity to support real-time agricultural practices and water quality protection. El Khoumsi Wafae and co-authors show that irrigation using treated wastewater generally promotes better growth in their article Effect of Treated Wastewater Irrigation on Ornamental Plants: Case Study of Lantana and Hibiscus, Morocco, highlighting the potential for a combination of treated wastewater and subsurface drip irrigation for irrigation of green spaces. Nepal has a high annual rainfall, but it still faces numerous challenges in ensuring good water quality. In the paper, An Analysis of Drinking Water Quality Parameters to Achieve Sustainable Development Goals in Rural and Urban Areas of Besisahar, Lamjung, Nepal, Mahendra Aryal reports on an analysis of 27 water samples taken from a variety of water sources with the results suggesting the need for great involvement of governments and developments in water resource management to ensure sustainability. Alebachew Shumye Moges and Sisay Assefa Wondimagegn then take us back to Ethiopia with their article, Evaluate the Effectiveness of Soil and Water Conservation Interventions in the Upper Awash Basin, Ethiopia, in which they survey community attitudes and assess the effectiveness of different conservation methods in enhancing soil physicochemical properties, reducing soil loss and erosion, and maximizing land productivity. In Assessing Groundwater Quality, Health Risks and Policy Implications: A Case Study of West Medinipur District, West Bengal, India, Md Anjar Alam, Damodhara Rao Mailapalli and Basant Maheshwari discuss the potential health risks, highlighting the complexity of groundwater quality and the need for comprehensive water policy and management strategies. Finally, Bitew K. Dessie and co-authors draw upon previous and current research to report on Pollution Challenges and Consequences of the Akaki Catchment, Upper Awash Basin, Ethiopia: Evidence for Policy Reform and Action. Finding that despite good laws and standards at federal and regional levels, environmental pollution is not being prevented because of ineffective implementation or enforcement, the authors recommend a set of specific and urgent policy measures. Thank you to all our authors and to the numerous reviewers who volunteered their time to support this issue of World Water Policy. We trust you will enjoy reading this rich collection of insights from around the world into water policy, practice, and the learning that supports them. We look forward to your contributions in the future. Our best wishes Susana Neto, Jeff Camkin 2023年11月30日至12月12日, 联合国气候变化框架公约(UNFCCC)第二十八次缔约方大会(COP28)在阿联酋举行, 本届世界气候行动峰会汇聚了154位国家元首和政府首脑。在峰会的最后阶段, 各方达成了几项重要协议, 包括""损失和损害""基金的操作化, 通过主席团青年气候倡导者加强儿童和青少年作为变革推动者的作用, 以及对""化石燃料使用的过渡 、减排和融资安排扩大""的操作化。 许多观察者和评论员认为, 这些协议(旨在于2030年之前采取更果断的气候行动, 以期将全球气温上升限制在1.5度以内)意味着对一个观点的认可, 即与 2019 年的水平相比, 2030年全球温室气体排放量需要减少43%才能实现这一目标。这包括加快逐步淘汰有增无减的煤电、逐步取消低效的化石燃料补贴, 以及加快一系列在能源系统中推动化石燃料转型的其他措施。建议以""发达国家继续带头的更加公平的发展方向""作为实现这些宏伟目标的路径, 如果可能的话, 在更接近2025年的时间内完成这些目标(即一年后!)。 其他研究人员指出, 紧急逐步淘汰化石燃料是必要的, 但还不够。Mazzucato等人(2023)认为, 即使我们明天就能实现经济脱碳, 但除非我们采取措施维护水系统和自然栖息地, 否则我们仍然不会拥有可持续的未来。作者论证, 有科学证据表明, ""自然损失本身就可能使我们无法实现巴黎气候协议的目标(即将全球变暖限制在比工业化前水平高1.5°C的范围内), 从而导致数百万生活在脆弱环境中的人将无法再适应""。此外, ""气候变化、生物多样性丧失和水不安全之间越来越明显的联系指出了一个根本问题:我们的经济系统建立在有缺陷的思维之上。当我们应该采取积极主动的战略来塑造经济以实现共同利益时, 我们却一直只对市场失灵作出反应""(同上)。 从 2014 年第一篇社论(Neto & Camkin, 2014)到 2023 年水在气候变化适应中的核心作用(Camkin & Neto, 2023), 我们一直呼吁人们关注水与可持续发展过程及目标的主要联系。如果没有脱碳, 就无法保护水资源和生物多样性。在环境及其提供的服务不受控制地枯竭的框架下, 各地对水及水资源的使用方式不平衡, 这无疑加剧了极端气候。2023年是有史以来最热的一年, 气温急剧上升, 许多国家发生严重火灾, 许多地区发生洪水。2023年, 我们看到所有这些极端情况如何对本已脆弱的人群和社区产生越来越大的影响, 使更多人无家可归, 并增加气候难民的数量。 这一困难下也出现了许多积极行动。例如, 在欧洲, 《欧洲可持续发展报告标准》(ESRS)自2024年1月1日起强制执行, 要求所有公司报告其运营和价值链中的水风险。这项关于水的强制性报告旨在帮助企业理解(1)由于对水的依赖而产生的重大风险和机遇;(2)公司的活动可能对水资源造成的影响;(3)公司为防止负面影响并促进更广泛的欧盟水目标而采取的行动(ESRS 2023)。 当然, 任何单一行动都不足以应对巨大且内在相互关联的挑战;在任何情况下都不能再忽视与水有关的问题。挑战不小, 并且是必要的。水循环、其领土联系、环境、经济用途和资源、治理——总而言之——需要能力和战略眼光。不幸的是, 能力和战略眼光都不充足, 这要求真正的变革行动者付出加倍的努力。 考虑到气候变化的规模及其影响, 最新的COP 28能为道路带来一丝曙光。但当我们审视正在发生的事情时, 这并不是一个完全乐观的前景。世界各地的行动者呼吁采取更明确的脱碳行动, 但遗憾的是, 尽管《巴黎协定》和去年底迪拜COP大会作出了最终决策, 许多地区仍继续支持和大力资助以化石燃料为基础的诸多活动。正如一些机构指出的那样, 许多国家""仍致力于在未来几年达到化石燃料使用的峰值……而已经批准并同意欧盟目标和新欧盟指令的国家仍然对化石燃料提供补贴""(Oikonomou, 2023)。例如, 在希腊, 三个环保组织已向欧盟委员会提出正式投诉, 指控希腊系统性地为希腊海岸附近的石油天然气钻探提供免费通行证, 违反了欧盟和国家法律。 由于COP28如此重要, 我们邀请了澳大利亚水伙伴关系总经理Sarah Ransom为本期撰写一篇客座社论, 题为《从迪拜归来:气候会议中对水的反思》。Sarah基于她参加过往COP大会的经历, 对COP28的现实情况提供了许多相关见解。Sarah总结道:""水社区有机会在两方面作出重大贡献, 第一, 通过快速发展的举措量化其对气候缓解的贡献, 并支持能源转型, 将全球变暖控制在1.5度内(UN Water, 2023), 第二, 确保我们的技能和知识帮助社区和生态系统建立复原力并在需要时进行适应。"" 接下来的18篇论文涉及广泛的水问题, 它们都与""改善研究、政策、实践和学习之间的联系""这一需求有关, 特别是在快速变化的全球情境下。 在《媒体是否没有真正理解美国的跨国海水淡化厂白日梦?》这篇论文中, Brian F. O'Neill以美国西南部和墨西哥的大规模海水淡化为例, 探究了媒体在传播""水政策和基础设施项目等全球重大跨边界问题""信息中所发挥的作用。在《与水资源利用相关的刑事犯罪预防问题》一文中, Nurlan Apakhayev和合著者借鉴哈萨克斯坦和其他地方的经验, 报告了他们对与水体有关的刑事犯罪的调查情况, 并提出制定一系列旨在打击此类犯罪的新战略和项目。水质管理是本期《全球水政策》(WWP)的重点内容。考虑到埃及立法规定的环境限制和行业特定参数, Doaa Abdou和Eid El–Ragehy在《解锁清洁水源的解决方案:埃及及其他地区的工业废水质量指数(IWQI)》一文中提出了一项工业水质指数。在题为《探究地下水与气候变化的相互作用:关于Philippe Cullet所著的⟨地下水与气候变化:多层次法律与政策视角⟩的批判性评论》的书评中, Kulsum Fatima分析了所提出的关键论点, 批判分析了该书对环境法和政策领域的贡献, 特别是与""气候变化和地下水之间的相互作用""有关的方面。 将焦点转回到北美, Holly Wilts、David Burton和Aitazaz Farooque在《结合短期轮作蒿柳的河岸缓冲区设计比较:缓解爱德华王子岛Dunk河流域的地表水污染》一文中探讨了不同河岸缓冲区配置的效能, 并识别了保护地表水免受污染的最佳缓冲区。在《尼日利亚小旱季期间的极端降雨和趋势》一文中, Joseph Omoniyi Adejuwon对尼日利亚的""小旱季""(雨季中的旱季)进行了分析, 这在西非是一种有趣的现象, 因为其对农业和粮食生产造成了影响。Vishal Narain和Chanda Goodrich在题为《玻璃杯是半空还是半满?南亚水资源综合管理中的性别问题》的讨论文中分析了南亚水务部门性别主流化举措影响力有限的原因, 指出了在地方父权式决策结构中为妇女保留席位一事对于改变现状几乎没有作用。 借鉴湄公河等沿岸国家的经验以及国际水法的共同立法框架, Hoa Thanh Ha和Tuan Van Vu在其论文《迫切呼吁对跨边界水道的保护和利用:一些立法反思》中讨论了""建立专门的国际水管理委员会""这一迫切需要。通过指出快速且频繁的洪水区制图对于监测和减轻洪水灾害而言至关重要, Sainath Reddy Poli和R. Bhavani在题为《安得拉邦 Nandigama 区域的洪水评估:使用水文和水力模型》的论文中报告了Nandigama洪水淹没制图及其对""规划和管理防洪基础设施""的启示。由于农业活动的高度扩张和土地使用管理不善, 土壤侵蚀成为埃塞俄比亚的一大挑战, 鉴于此, Eyasu Tafese Mekuria的论文《沉积物产量评估和缓解措施建议:埃塞俄比亚奥莫-吉贝盆地Deme流域案例研究》报告了沉积物产量评估并提出了一系列可将沉积物产量减少高达90%的缓解措施。 Amit Kumar Sharma和合著者在题为《关于浮游生物作为生物指示剂的述评:一项监测水质的有用工具》的文章中研究了生物指示剂在水资源管理中越来越多的使用, 并强调了关于一系列浮游生物为水质管理提供机遇的近期研究。继续围绕水质主题, Eskinder Zinabu及其合著者撰写的《评估水机构的结构和安排, 以提出用于水质管理和污染控制的河道内建模:来自埃塞俄比亚阿瓦什流域的见解》一文批判性分析了现有模型和支持环境, 并提出""提高机构能力""一事所需的变革。Rajneesh Kumar和Rajendra Prasad Mahapatra在其论文《使用混合深度学习模型预测北方邦自然灾害的严重程度和作物产量》中探讨了作物产量预测方法的缺点, 并提出了一系列用于更好地结合自然灾害(干旱、冰雹)与风暴严重程度的方法, 以支持实时农业实践与水质保护。El Khoumsi Wafae和合著者在其文章《处理后的废水灌溉对观赏植物的影响:以摩洛哥的马缨丹和朱槿为例》中表明, 使用处理过的废水进行灌溉通常会促进更好的生长, 强调了处理过的废水和地下滴灌相结合的潜力, 以用于绿地灌溉。 尼泊尔年降雨量高, 但在确保良好水质方面仍面临诸多挑战。在题为《分析尼泊尔拉姆琼贝西萨哈农村和城市地区的饮用水质参数, 以实现可持续发展目标》的论文中, Mahendra Aryal报告了一项对""来自不同水源的27个水样""的分析, 结果表明, 需要政府大力参与水资源管理和一系列发展, 以确保可持续性。Alebachew Shumye Moges和Sisay Assefa Wondimagegn将我们带回埃塞俄比亚, 他们的文章题为《评价埃塞俄比亚上阿瓦什盆地水土保持干预措施的有效性》。文章调查了社区态度并评估了不同保护方法在增强土壤理化特性、减少水土流失和侵蚀、以及最大限度提高土地生产力方面的有效性。在《评估地下水质、健康风险和政策启示:印度西孟加拉邦西梅迪尼布尔县案例研究》一文中, Md Anjar Alam、Damodhara Rao Mailapalli和Basant Maheshwari探讨了潜在的健康风险, 强调了地下水质的复杂性以及""全面的水政策和管理战略""的必要性。最后, Bitew K. Dessie和合著者在《埃塞俄比亚上阿瓦什盆地阿卡基流域的污染挑战和结果:政策改革与行动的证据》一文中对以往和当前的研究进行了报告。作者发现, 尽管联邦和地区层面有良好的法律和标准, 但由于实施或执行不力, 环境污染并未得到预防, 因此建议采取一套具体而紧急的政策措施。 感谢我们所有的作者以及众多自愿花时间支持本期《世界水政策》的审稿人。我们相信您会享受阅读本期内容, 受益于来自世界各地的、""关于水政策、实践以及支持它们的学习""的丰富见解。. 我们期待您的投稿。 献上最美好的祝愿 Susana Neto, Jeff Camkin 关键词 气候变化, COP 28, 水质, 水政策与实践, 水资源综合管理, 水政策. Del 30 de noviembre al 12 de diciembre de 2023 se celebró en los Emiratos Árabes Unidos la 28 Conferencia de las Partes (COP28) de la Convención Marco de las Naciones Unidas sobre el Cambio Climático (CMNUCC), esta Cumbre Mundial sobre Acción Climática reunió a 154 Jefes de Estado y de Gobierno. En la etapa final de la Cumbre, las Partes alcanzaron varios acuerdos importantes, incluida la puesta en funcionamiento del fondo para pérdidas y daños, que refuerza el papel de los niños y los jóvenes como agentes de cambio a través del liderazgo juvenil climático de la Presidencia, hasta la puesta en práctica de la transición desde el uso de combustibles fósiles, recortes de emisiones y acuerdos de financiación ampliados. Según muchos observadores y comentaristas, los acuerdos, que apuntan a una acción climática más decisiva antes del final de la década para mantener el límite de temperatura global de 1,5°C, implican el reconocimiento de que las emisiones globales de gases de efecto invernadero deben reducirse en un 43% para 2030. en comparación con los niveles de 2019, para lograr ese objetivo. Esto incluye acelerar los esfuerzos hacia la reducción gradual de la energía a base de carbón, eliminar gradualmente los subsidios ineficientes a los combustibles fósiles y otras medidas que impulsen la transición para alejarse de los combustibles fósiles en los sistemas energéticos. Se sugiere que la dirección hacia un desarrollo más equitativo, en el que los países desarrollados sigan a la cabeza, es el camino para alcanzar esos ambiciosos objetivos y, si es posible, más cerca de 2025 (¡dentro de un año!). Otros investigadores señalan que la urgente eliminación gradual de los combustibles fósiles es necesaria pero no suficiente. Mazzucato et al. (2023) consideran que incluso si pudiéramos descarbonizar la economía mañana, todavía no tendríamos un futuro sostenible hasta que tomemos medidas para mantener los sistemas hídricos y los hábitats naturales. Los autores sostienen que existe evidencia científica de que ""la pérdida de naturaleza por sí sola puede hacernos fracasar en el objetivo del acuerdo climático de París de limitar el calentamiento global a 1,5°C por encima de los niveles preindustriales, marcando el comienzo de un mundo donde millones de personas en entornos vulnerables ya no podría adaptarse"". Además, ""los vínculos cada vez más documentados entre el cambio climático, la pérdida de biodiversidad y la inseguridad hídrica apuntan a una cuestión fundamental: nuestros sistemas económicos se basan en un pensamiento erróneo. Siempre estamos reaccionando a las fallas del mercado cuando deberíamos buscar estrategias proactivas para configurar la economía para el bien común"" (Ibid). Hemos llamado la atención sobre las principales conexiones del agua con el proceso y los objetivos de desarrollo sostenible, desde nuestro primer editorial en 2014 (Neto y Camkin, 2014) hasta el papel central del agua en la adaptación al cambio climático en 2023 (Camkin & Neto, 2023). La salvaguardia de los recursos hídricos y la biodiversidad no se puede lograr sin la descarbonización. El uso desequilibrado del agua y sus recursos en todas partes, en un marco de agotamiento incontrolado del medio ambiente y de los servicios que éste proporciona, ha contribuido sin duda a la intensificación de los extremos climáticos. 2023 fue el año más caluroso jamás registrado (CE, 2023), con un aumento crítico de las temperaturas, incendios graves en muchos países e inundaciones en muchas regiones. En 2023 vimos cómo todos estos extremos están teniendo un impacto cada vez mayor en poblaciones y comunidades que ya son vulnerables, dejando a más personas sin hogar y aumentando el número de refugiados climáticos. En medio de la oscuridad hay muchas acciones positivas. En Europa, por ejemplo, los Estándares Europeos de Informes de Sostenibilidad (ESRS) se aplicaron a partir del 1 de enero de 2024, lo que obliga a todas las empresas a informar los riesgos hídricos en sus operaciones y cadenas de valor. Este informe obligatorio sobre el agua tiene como objetivo ayudar a las empresas a comprender (1) los riesgos y oportunidades materiales que surgen de su dependencia del agua; (2) los impactos que las actividades de una empresa pueden tener en los recursos hídricos; y (3) las acciones que una empresa está tomando para prevenir impactos negativos y contribuir a los objetivos hídricos más amplios de la UE (ESRS 2023). Por supuesto, ninguna acción por sí sola es suficiente para hacer frente a los enormes desafíos intrínsecamente interconectados; Las cuestiones relacionadas con el agua ya no pueden ignorarse en ningún contexto. El desafío no es pequeño ni prescindible. El ciclo del agua, sus vínculos territoriales, el medio ambiente, los usos y recursos económicos, la gobernanza -en una palabra- requieren competencia y visión estratégica. Desafortunadamente, ambos no abundan, lo que exige esfuerzos multiplicados por parte de los verdaderos agentes del cambio. Dada la escala de los cambios climáticos y sus efectos, la última COP 28 puede arrojar algo de luz sobre el camino. Pero no es una perspectiva enteramente optimista cuando analizamos lo que efectivamente está sucediendo. Los actores de todo el mundo claman por acciones más claras para la descarbonización pero, lamentablemente, muchas de las actividades basadas en combustibles fósiles siguen siendo apoyadas y fuertemente financiadas en muchas regiones, a pesar del Acuerdo de París y las decisiones finales de la Conferencia de las Partes en Dubai en finales del año pasado. Como lo señalaron varias agencias, muchos países ""todavía apuntan a alcanzar el máximo uso de combustibles fósiles en los próximos años … y los países que han ratificado y acordado los objetivos de la Unión Europea y las nuevas directivas de la UE, todavía subsidian los combustibles fósiles"". (Oikonomou, 2023). Por ejemplo, en Grecia, tres organizaciones ambientalistas han presentado una queja formal ante la Comisión Europea contra Grecia por dar sistemáticamente vía libre a las perforaciones de petróleo y gas frente a las costas griegas, en violación de las leyes nacionales y de la UE. Debido a que la COP28 fue tan importante, invitamos a Sarah Ransom, Gerente General de Australian Water Partnership, a escribir un editorial invitado para esta edición, titulado Regresando de Dubai: Reflexiones sobre el agua en la Conferencia sobre el Clima. Sarah brinda muchas ideas relevantes sobre las realidades de la COP28, basándose en su experiencia de haber asistido también a COP anteriores. Sarah concluye que ""hay una oportunidad por delante para que la comunidad del agua haga una contribución significativa tanto a la lucha por los 1,5º C como para garantizar que nuestras habilidades y conocimientos ayuden a las comunidades y los ecosistemas a desarrollar resiliencia y adaptarse donde sea necesario, siguiendo el llamado de la ONU. que los profesionales del agua desempeñen un papel en la acción climática en esta década crítica"". Los siguientes 18 artículos abordan una amplia gama de cuestiones relacionadas con el agua, todas ellas vinculadas a la necesidad de mejorar la conexión entre la investigación, las políticas, la práctica y el aprendizaje, particularmente en el contexto global que cambia rápidamente. En el artículo, ¿Los medios no entienden la quimera transnacional estadounidense de la desalinización? Brian F. O'Neill utiliza el ejemplo de la desalinización de agua de mar a gran escala en el suroeste de Estados Unidos y México para explorar el papel que desempeñan los medios en la difusión de información sobre cuestiones transfronterizas de importancia mundial, como las políticas hídricas y los proyectos de infraestructura. Basándose en experiencias de Kazajstán y otros lugares, Nurlan Apakhayev y sus coautores informan sobre su investigación sobre delitos penales relacionados con masas de agua y proponen el desarrollo de nuevas estrategias y programas destinados a contrarrestar dichos delitos en Problemas de prevención de delitos penales relacionados con el uso. de Recursos Hídricos. La gestión de la calidad del agua ocupa un lugar destacado en este número de WWP. Teniendo en cuenta tanto los límites ambientales especificados por la legislación egipcia como los parámetros específicos de la industria, Doaa Abdou y Eid El—Ragehy proponen un índice de calidad del agua industrial para desbloquear soluciones para aguas más limpias: el índice de calidad de las aguas residuales industriales (IWQI) en Egipto y más allá. En una reseña del libro ""Exploring Groundwater-Climate Change Interactions: A Critical Review of Groundwater and Climate Change: Multi-Level Law and Policy Perspectives"" de Philippe Cullet, Kulsum Fatima examina los argumentos clave presentados, analizando críticamente la contribución del libro al campo del medio ambiente. Leyes y políticas, particularmente en relación con las interacciones entre el cambio climático y las aguas subterráneas. Al regresar a América del Norte, Holly Wilts, David Burton y Aitazaz Farooque discuten la eficacia de varias configuraciones de zonas de amortiguamiento ribereñas e identifican zonas de amortiguamiento óptimas para proteger el agua superficial de la contaminación en Una comparación de diseños de zonas de amortiguamiento ribereñas que incorporan Salix viminalis de rotación corta para mitigar la contaminación del agua superficial. en la cuenca del río Dunk en la Isla del Príncipe Eduardo. En Rainfall Extremes and TrendsDurante la pequeña estación seca en Nigeria, Joseph Omoniyi Adejuwon presenta a continuación un análisis de la ""pequeña estación seca"" en Nigeria -un período seco en medio de la estación húmeda- que es un fenómeno de interés en África occidental debido a su impactos en la agricultura y la producción de alimentos. Vishal Narain y Chanda Goodrich analizan las razones del impacto limitado de los esfuerzos por incorporar la perspectiva de género en el sector del agua en el sur de Asia en su documento de debate, ¿Vaso medio vacío o medio lleno? Género en la gestión integrada de los recursos hídricos en el sur de Asia, señalando que reservar puestos para las mujeres en las estructuras patriarcales locales de toma de decisiones contribuye poco a alterar el status quo. Tomando lecciones de las experiencias de países ribereños como el río Mekong y los marcos legales comunes sobre el derecho internacional del agua, Hoa Thanh Ha y Tuan Van Vu discuten la urgente necesidad de establecer una comisión internacional especializada en gestión del agua en su documento: Llamado urgente para la protección y uso de los recursos de agua transfronterizos: Algunas reflexiones jurídicas. Observando que el mapeo rápido y frecuente de las áreas inundables es crucial para monitorear y mitigar los desastres causados por inundaciones, el artículo de Sainath Reddy Poli y R.

Urban planners are currently avidly investigating vegetation land fragmentation due to its effects on sustainable development. The literature has identified a research gap in the development of Artificial Intelligence [AI]-based models to simulate vegetation land fragmentation in urban contexts with multiple affecting elements. As a result, the primary aim of this research is to create an AI-based simulation framework to simulate vegetation land fragmentation in metropolitan settings. The main objective is to use non-linear analysis to identify the factors that contribute to vegetation land fragmentation. The proposed methodology is applied for Western Province, Sri Lanka. Accessibility growth, initial vegetation large patch size, initial vegetation land fragmentation, initial built-up land fragmentation, initial vegetation shape irregularity, initial vegetation circularity, initial building density, and initial vegetation patch association are the main variables used to frame the model among the 20 variables related to patches, corridors, matrix and other. This study created a feed-forward Artificial Neural Network [ANN] using R statistical software to analyze non-linear interactions and their magnitudes. The study likewise utilized WEKA software to create a Decision Tree [DT] modeling framework to explain the effect of variables. According to the ANN olden algorithm, accessibility growth has the maximum importance level [44] between -50 and 50, while DT reveals accessibility growth as the root of the Level of Vegetation Land Fragmentation [LVLF]. Small, irregular, and dispersed vegetation patches are especially vulnerable to fragmentation. As a result, study contributes detech and managing vegetation land fragmentation patterns in urban environments, while opening up vegetation land fragmentation research topics to AI applications.","",https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0275457,"",,
rayyan-210784852,Simulation of the Ecological Service Value and Ecological Compensation in Arid Area: A Case Study of Ecologically Vulnerable Oasis,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"In recent years, the delicate balance between economic development and ecological environment protection in ecologically fragile arid areas has gradually become apparent. Although previous research has mainly focused on changes in ecological service value caused by land use, a comprehensive understanding of ecology–economy harmony and ecological compensation remains elusive. To address this, we employed a coupled deep learning model (convolutional neural network-gated recurrent unit) to simulate the ecological service value of the Wuwei arid oasis over the next 10 years. The ecology–economy harmony index was used to determine the priority range of ecological compensation, while the GeoDetector analyzed the potential impact of driving factors on ecological service value from 2000 to 2030. The results show the following: (1) The coupled model, which extracts spatial features in the neighborhood of historical data using a convolutional neural network and adaptively learns time features using the gated recurrent unit, achieved an overall accuracy of 0.9377, outperforming three other models (gated recurrent unit, convolutional neural network, and convolutional neural network—long short-term memory); (2) Ecological service value in the arid oasis area illustrated an overall increasing trend from 2000 to 2030, but urban expansion still caused a decrease in ecological service value; (3) Historical ecology–economy harmony was mainly characterized by low conflict and potential crisis, while future ecology–economy harmony will be characterized by potential crisis and high coordination. Minqin and Tianzhu in the north and south have relatively high coordination between ecological environment and economic development, while Liangzhou and Guluang in the west and east exhibited relatively low coordination, indicating a greater urgency for ecological compensation; (4) Geomorphic, soil, and digital elevation model emerged as the most influential natural factor affecting the spatial differentiation of ecological service value in the arid oasis area. This study is of great significance for balancing economic development and ecological protection and promoting sustainable development in arid areas.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/rs15163927,"",,

To reduce the losses caused by floods, various urban flood models have been developed to realize urban flood early warning. Using CiteSpace software’s co-citation analysis, this paper reviews the characteristics of different types of urban flood models and summarizes state-of-the-art technologies for flood model development. Artificial intelligence (AI) technology provides an innovative approach to the construction of data-driven models; nevertheless, developing an AI model coupled with flooding processes represents a worthwhile challenge. Big data (such as remote sensing, crowdsourcing geographic, and Internet of Things data), as well as spatial data management and analysis methods, provide critical data and data processing support for model construction, evaluation, and application.

In this context, we evaluate historical and future associations between land use land cover changes and land surface temperature in Dera Ghazi Khan–one of the top cities in Pakistan–using multi-temporal Landsat data over two decades (2002–2022). After assessing current land use changes and future predictions, their impact on land surface temperature and urban heat island effect is measured using machine learning via Multi-Layer Perceptron-Markov Chain, Artificial Neural Network and Cellular Automata. Significant changes in land use land cover were observed in the last two decades. The built-up area expanded greatly (874 ha) while agriculture land (−687 ha) and barren land (−253 ha) show decreasing trend. The water bodies were found the lowest changes (57 ha) and vegetation cover got the largest proportion in all the years. This green-grey conversion in the last two decades (8.7%) and prospect along the main corridors show the gravity of unplanned urban growth at the cost of vegetation and agricultural land (−6.8%). The land surface temperature and urban heat island effect shows a strong positive correlation between urbanization and vegetation removal. The simulation results presented in this study confirm that by 2032, the city will face a 5° C high mean temperature based on historical patterns, which could potentially lead to more challenges associated with urban heat island if no appropriate measures are taken. It is expected that due to land cover changes by 2032, ~60% of urban and peri-urban areas will experience very hot to hot temperatures (&amp;gt; 31.5°C). Our results provide baseline information to urban managers and planners to understand the increasing trends of land surface temperature in response to land cover changes. The study is important for urban resource management, sustainable development policies, and actions to mitigate the heat island effect. It will further asset the broader audience to understand the impact of land use land cover changes on the land surface temperature and urban heat island effect in the light of historic pattern and machine learning approach.","",https://doi.org/10.3389/fevo.2023.1115074,"",,

To that end, two LULC scenarios known as business as usual (BAU) and protection-based (PB) plan were applied for 2028, using the Markov Artificial Neural Network and Multi-objective land allocation (MOLA) models. The results show that rapid urbanisation, caused by the expansion of human settlements and industrial areas, has led to a decline in the ESs in the region. Compared to the ESs in 2017, the service of water yield increases as urban expansion increases, whereas food production and recreation services decrease as urban expansion increases, under the BAU scenario. On the other hand, in the PB scenario, relatively better conditions can be observed for all three ESs. Considering that the ecological structures of this region have been severely affected by rapid urban expansion, the results of this research will be useful for maintaining the existing ESs and can greatly affect planning and decision-making regarding future development towards urban sustainability.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/land12020291,"",,

To appropriately manage the runoff in urban areas, an integrated system including the simulations of sewer flow, street flow, and regional channel flow, called the 1D/1D SWMM model, was advocated to be performed. Nevertheless, the execution efficiency of this integrated system still needs to be promoted to meet the demand for real-time forecasting of urban floods. The objective of this study is to seek an alternative for predicting water levels both in the sewer system and on the streets within an urban district during rainstorms by utilizing a dynamic neuron network model. To strengthen the physical structure of the artificial intelligence (AI) model and simultaneously make up for the lack of measured data, simulation results of the 1D/1D SWMM model are provided as labels for the training of the proposed model. The novelty of this research is to propose a new methodology to effectively train the AI model for predicting the spatial distributions of depths based on the hydrologic conditions, geomorphologic properties, as well as the network relation of the drainage system. A two-stage training procedure is proposed in this study to consider more possible inundation conditions in both sewer and street (open channel) drainage networks. The research findings show that the proposed methodology is capable of reaching satisfactory accuracy and assisting the numerical-based SWMM model for real-time warning of drainage systems in the urban district.","",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2023.119099,"",,

Acknowledged as rich in biodiversity and highly productive ecosystems, they provide ecosystem services represented in aspects such as air purification, urban climate regulation, physical and mental health, recreation, and contemplation, among a wide variety of other goods and services on which the quality of life of the inhabitants of large cities such as Bogota depends largely. We used cellular automata to model and simulate urban wetland changes in Bogota, Colombia. The study applied the coupled Markov-Future Land Use Simulation (FLUS) model to simulate and analyze land use/land cover (LULC) change over 20 years. First, we used an orthomosaic (1998) and two WorldView-2 satellite images (2004 and 2010), to detect land cover changes. Then, using the artificial neural network FLUS module, we calculated the relationships between land classes and associated drivers and estimated the probability of occurrence of each land class. Finally, we applied Intensity Analysis to examine the observed and projected LULC change (1998-2034). Results indicate that gains in areas of crops and pastures are at the expense of wetlands. In addition, simulation outputs show that wetlands will likely represent less than 2% of the total study area in 2034, representing a 14% decrease in 24 years. The importance of this project lies in its potential contribution to the decision-making process within the city and as an instrument of natural resource management.

Remote sensing technology and very-high-resolution (VHR) bitemporal satellite imagery enable change detection (CD) for monitoring forest changes. However, deep learning techniques for forest CD concatenate bitemporal images into a single input, limiting the extraction of informative deep features from individual raw images. Furthermore, they are developed for middle to low-resolution images focused on specific forests such as the Amazon or a single element in the urban environment. Therefore, in this study, we propose deep learning-based urban forest CD along with overall changes in the urban environment by using VHR bitemporal images. Two networks are used independently: DeepLabv3+ for generating binary forest cover masks, and a deeply supervised image fusion network (DSIFN) for the generation of a binary change mask. The results are concatenated for semantic CD focusing on forest cover changes. To carry out the experiments, full scene tests were performed using the VHR bitemporal imagery of three urban cities acquired via three different satellites. The findings reveal significant changes in forest covers alongside urban environmental changes. Based on the accuracy assessment, the networks used in the proposed study achieved the highest F1-score, kappa, IoU, and accuracy values compared with those using other techniques.

The intelligent interpretation of land-use change has become a research frontier. Reasonably and effectively utilizing limited land resources and making scientific predictions to promote sustainable utilization of land resources is significant for establishing a resource-saving and environmentally friendly society. Remote sensing technology can efficiently complete multi-temporal and dynamic land-use change detection, especially using high-spatial resolution remote sensing images. However, the existing land-use change and prediction have not been combined. In addition, land-use change detection mainly relies on shallow feature design, resulting in low prediction accuracy and weak generalization performance. To solve the above problems, we proposed a CNN-based CA Markov model using multi-temporal GaoFen satellite remote sensing images for the change detection and prediction of land cover. Taking the city of Panzhihua in China as an example, the study constructed training sample data that includes a multi-temporal remote sensing training dataset from 2006, 2010, 2015, and 2021 using GaoFen satellite remote sensing images. Meanwhile, a multitemporal CNN land-use detection model was constructed to generate a land-use transfer matrix by training the dataset. Furthermore, the comprehensive driving factors were selected, including terrain factors (height and slope) and social factors (economic and population density). Then, the CA-Markov model was constructed to predict the land-use development trend in Panzhihua City after ten years. Compared with the traditional methods, experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model can improve the model's automatic interpretation ability and prediction accuracy with an increase of 24.6% in the FoM index and 4.37% in the Kappa coefficient.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/isprs-archives-xlviii-m-3-2023-279-2023,"",,

Flood risk assessment is crucial task for disaster management activities in flood-prone areas. In this study, we proposed a flood risk assessment framework that combines flood vulnerability, hazard, and damages under long-term LULC changes in the Tajan watershed, northern Iran. The research analyzed historical land use change trends and predicted changes up to 2040 by employing GIS, remote sensing, and land change modeling. The flood vulnerability map was generated using the Random Forest model, incorporating historical data from 332 flooded locations and 12 geophysical and anthropogenic flood factors under LULC change scenarios. The potential flood damage costs in residential and agricultural areas, considering long-term LULC changes, were calculated using the HEC-RAS hydraulic model and a global damage function. Results revealed that unplanned urban growth, agricultural expansion, and deforestation near the river downstream amplify flood risk in 2040. High and very high flood vulnerability areas would increase by 43% in 2040 due to human activities and LULC changes. Estimated annual flood damage for agriculture and built-up areas was projected to surge from $162 million to $376 million and $91 million to $220 million, respectively, considering 2021 and 2040 land use change scenarios in the flood-prone region.

The balance between food security and energy security is a national issue of extreme importance. A more stable supply of electricity could be achieved as solar farms expand but at the expense of losing some of the prime agricultural lands which endangers availability of sufficient agricultural produce. This study aims to use ANN-Cellular Automata (CA) via the Geographic Information System (GIS) platform and remote sensing (RS) data to assess the impact of cropland transition to solar farms and other land use/land cover (LULC). Several remotely sensed data were processed including MODIS land cover data (MCD12Q1), VIIRS nighttime lights (VNL v2.1), Advanced Himawari Imager Shortwave Radiation (AHI-SWR) product, and population density (LandScan) as inputs to the Cellular Automata-Artificial Neural Network (CA-ANN) model to simulate LULC changes in Tarlac Province, Philippines via the Modules for Land Use Change Evaluation (MOLUSCE) plugin in QGIS. For years 2019, 2023 and 2027 with 2015 as the base year, results showed an increasing trend for savannas and grassland with ΔLULC values of +11.4% to +15.1% and +0.2% to 3.5%, respectively. Meanwhile, a decreasing trend is observed for built-up/water, forest, and cropland with ΔLULC values of −3.0% to −6.3%, −8.5% to −21.1%, and −3.9% to −4.2%, respectively. Results also showed a conversion of a 100-ha area of croplands to solar farm from year 2019 to 2023 which translates to an estimated monetary loss from agricultural produce due to solar farm conversion amounting to Php 7,584,720.00 (~USD 138,000) which is equivalent to the total average annual income of about 67 families in Tarlac. Lastly, the simulated 2027 LULC map showed pixels with unrealistic conversions from solar farm (year 2023) to cropland (year 2027). To improve the model, it is recommended to add more spatial data to effectively capture factors that may contribute to the expansion of solar farms in the future. Moreover, high resolution LULC maps (vector maps if available) can be used instead of a course resolution satellite-derived raster data. Nonetheless, this study has demonstrated the use of RS, GIS and machine learning techniques to model cropland conversion to solar farms and other LULC classes. Results from this study can provide scientific data to policy makers, solar industry players and other relevant stakeholders in doing technoeconomic assessment of solar farm development and expansion considering its effect on energy security and food security towards national sustainable development.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/isprs-archives-xlviii-m-1-2023-255-2023,"",,

We applied this approach in the Upper Flint watershed, which flows south from the Atlanta, Georgia metropolitan area and is characterized by extensive urbanization and associated deforestation. Our results suggest that incorporating social and policy drivers in future LULC projection approaches leads to more realistic results with higher accuracy levels, offering decision-makers, development planners, and policymakers better opportunities to forecast the effects of anticipated changes on the availability of ESs in the future.

rayyan-210785827,Detecting Spatiotemporal Dynamics and Driving Patterns in Forest Fragmentation with a Forest Fragmentation Comprehensive Index (FFCI): Taking an Area with Active Forest Cover Change as a Case Study,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Forests play an irreplaceable role in preserving soil and water, as well as realizing carbon neutrality. However, logging and urban expansion have caused widespread forest fragmentation globally, resulting in biodiversity loss and carbon emissions. Therefore, it is a prerequisite to develop a comprehensive index for evaluating the degree of forest fragmentation to propose effective policies for forest protection and restoration. In this study, a forest fragmentation comprehensive index (FFCI) was constructed through principal component analysis (PCA) based on land-use data from 2000 to 2020 in Fujian Province, composed of five commonly used landscape metrics: patch density (PD), largest patch index (LPI), mean patch area (MPA), aggregation index (AI), and division. Then, the semivariogram function and moving windows method were employed to explore the scale effect and spatiotemporal variations of FFCI. The spatial autocorrelation analysis was used to distinguish the spatial relationship of forest fragmentation, while the driving mechanisms were explored using the geographic detector (GD). The results show that the optimal scale to reflect forest fragmentation based on the semivariogram and moving window method was 3500 m. The proposed FFCI could explain more than 85% of the information for all landscape metrics, and the effectivity of FFCI was validated by urban–rural gradient and transect analysis. We also found that, despite having the highest forest coverage in China, Fujian Province has experienced severe forest fragmentation. High and medium fragmentation accounted for over 50% of all types of fragmentation, with decreasing trends in low and very low fragmentation and increasing trends in high fragmentation over time, indicating that the degree of forest fragmentation in the study area was aggravated over time. Moreover, the spatial distribution pattern of FFCI was mainly high–high clusters and low–low clusters, showing a decreasing trend year by year. The areas with high fragmentation were mainly distributed in the urban center of coastal cities, while the internal cities in western and central regions had a relatively low degree of fragmentation. Additionally, the spatial differentiation in the variation in FFCI was mainly influenced by elevation, slope, and nighttime light intensity. The superimposed impact of two factors on the variation in FFCI was greater than the impact of individual factors. These results provide an effective approach for assessing the degree of forest fragmentation and offer scientific support for mitigating forest fragmentation.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/f14061135,"",,
rayyan-210785889,Advancements in Agronomic Practices for Sustainable Crop Production: A Review,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"This review provides a comprehensive analysis of the advancements in agronomic practices that contribute to sustainable crop production. In the context of escalating global food demand, climate change, and environmental concerns, sustainable agriculture has become a pivotal focus. This paper systematically examines the evolution of agronomic practices from traditional methods to contemporary innovations, highlighting the integration of technology, sustainability, and socio-economic factors in modern agriculture. The historical perspective of agronomic practices reveals a transition from rudimentary, labor-intensive methods to technologically driven, precision-based approaches. Traditional practices, while sustainable, often faced limitations in scalability and efficiency. The advent of the Green Revolution marked a significant shift, introducing high-yield crop varieties and synthetic inputs. However, the long-term ecological impacts of these methods prompted a reevaluation towards more sustainable practices. Contemporary advancements in agronomy are largely characterized by precision agriculture, which employs satellite and drone technology, sensor-based monitoring systems, and AI applications. These tools have revolutionized farming by enabling precise resource management and data-driven decision-making. In tandem, the rise of organic farming and integrated pest management reflects a growing emphasis on ecological balance and reduced chemical inputs. The paper also delves into the crucial role of education and extension services in disseminating modern agronomic knowledge, particularly in developing regions. Government policies and international regulations are analyzed for their impact on promoting sustainable practices. Additionally, the review addresses the vital aspect of environmental sustainability, focusing on strategies for carbon footprint reduction, biodiversity preservation, and ecosystem services enhancement. Technological innovations, especially in genetics and digital tools, are identified as key drivers in shaping future agronomic practices. The potential of CRISPR in crop improvement and the application of big data and IoT in farming are discussed as future trends.","",https://doi.org/10.9734/ijpss/2023/v35i224178,"",,
rayyan-210785895,Real-Time Urban Flood Forecasting: Application of Hybrid Modelling Using Both Physically based and Data-Driven models,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Today, urban flood forecasting is modelled well by hydrologists through physically based models in which different weather data, characteristics of catchments and streams/conduits are used as inputs to provide water level in UDS or water depth of surface runoff [1]. However, continuous access to these data can be challenging and demanding for model calibration or real-time applications that result in lack of providing accurate forecasting [2]. Alternatively, data-driven models can be used in hydrology and data sciences to provide high-speed, less data demanding, and more accuracy for especially short-term water level/depth of urban flooding [3]. However, these models can be inaccurate when new situations, especially new climate change based extreme events, occurred because these models are unable to understand and be adapted with different physical and hydrological situation of catchments [4]. Therefore, while both approaches are well-explored in simulating rainfall-runoff relationship over the urban catchments of interest, coupling these models sound promising and worth investigating in real-time applications of flood warning systems.The present study critically investigates the applications of real-time hybrid models in which physically based and data-driven models are coupled together as integrated platform to take advantages of each type of modelling. The results show three different approaches have been highlighted in this area: (1) using physically-based models to provided up-to-date input data for machine-learning based modelling, (2) applying data-mining techniques to extract the rainfall-runoff features that are used for physically-based models, particularly different types of storm water management model, (3) error bias adjustment or interpolation of forecasts by using both physically-based and data-drive modelling.Results also indicate that the first approach have been usually expressed when input database faces missing data problem, high value uncertainty or highly impacted by climate-related extreme events. This approach was also used for small-scale but dense city area without flexibility in surface lands or underground modifications. On the other hand, the second approach have been presented where big database are available and data screening are required. Furthermore, this modelling approach is more appropriate for high variability and high coverage catchment areas. Finally, the last modelling approach outperforms other approaches in covering both quality and quantity of data resources. However, integration of interpolation and bias adjustment of individual models still have remains as open case than should be more tested in the future.References[1] Zounemat-Kermani, M., Matta, E., Cominola, A., Xia, X., Zhang, Q., Liang, Q., Hinkelmann, R.

In this viewpoint article, we propose to advance SRS products with a terrestrial biodiversity focus for tracking the goals and targets of the Kunming-Montreal global biodiversity framework (GBF). Of 371 GBF biodiversity indicators, we identified 58 unique indicators for tracking the state of terrestrial biodiversity, spanning 2 goals and 8 targets. Thirty-six shared enough information to analyse their underlying workflows and spatial information products. We used the concept of Essential Biodiversity Variables (EBV) to connect spatial information products to different dimensions of biodiversity (e.g. species populations, species traits, and ecosystem structure), and then counted EBV usage across GBF goals and targets. Combined with published scores on feasibility, accuracy, and immaturity of SRS products, we identified a priority list of terrestrial SRS products representing opportunities for scientific development in the next decade. From this list, we suggest two key directions for advancing SRS products and workflows in the GBF context using current instruments and technologies. First, existing terrestrial ecosystem distributions and live cover fraction SRS products (of above-ground biomass, ecosystem fragmentation, ecosystem structural variance, fraction of vegetation cover, plant area index profile, and land cover) need to be refined using a co-design approach to achieve harmonized ecosystem taxonomies, reference states and improved thematic detail. Second, new SRS products related to plant physiology and primary productivity (e.g. leaf area index, chlorophyll content & flux, foliar N/P/K content, and carbon cycle) need to be developed to better estimate plant functional traits, especially with deep learning techniques, radiative transfer models and multi-sensor frameworks.

rayyan-210786013,Using a Novel Green Index to Support Ecosystem Services in a Megacity,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"We present a novel and efficient approach that enables the evaluation of environmental quality in cities worldwide using high-resolution satellite imagery, based on a new green index (GI) through multivariate analysis, to compare the proportion of urban green spaces (UGSs) with built and impervious surfaces. High-resolution images were used to perform a supervised classification of 25 districts in the city of São Paulo, Brazil. Only 11 districts showed higher urban forests, green spaces, green index, and green vs. built values, and impervious surface proportions with lower impervious and built spaces. On the other hand, the remaining districts had higher population densities and unfavorable conditions for urban ecosystem development. In some cases, urban green spaces were three-times smaller than the built and impervious surfaces, and none of the districts attained a high green quality index (0.75 to 1). Artificial intelligence techniques improved the precise identification of land cover, particularly vegetation, such as trees, shrubs, and grasses. The development of a novel green index, using multivariate statistical analysis, enhanced positive interactions among soil cover classes, emphasizing priority areas for enhancing environmental quality. Most of them should be prioritized by decision makers due to the low environmental quality, as identified by the low green index and worse ecosystem services, well-being, and health outcomes. The method can be employed in many other cities to enhance urban ecosystem quality, well-being, and health. The green index and supervised classification can characterize pastures, degraded forest fragments, and guide forest restoration techniques in diverse landscapes.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/f14091705,"",,

rayyan-210786120,Hyper-local temperature prediction using detailed urban climate informatics,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Modeling urban microclimate accurately is challenging due to the high surface heterogeneity of urban land cover and the vertical structure of street morphology. Recent years have witnessed significant efforts in numerical modeling and data collection of the urban environment. Nonetheless, it is difficult for the physical-based models to fully utilize the high-resolution data under the constraints of computing resources. The advancement in machine learning techniques offers the computational strength to handle the massive volume of data. In this study, we proposed a machine learning approach to estimate point-scale street-level air temperature from the urban-resolving mesoscale climate model and a suite of hyper-resolution urban informatics, including three-dimensional urban morphology, parcel-level land use inventory, and a dense weather observation network. We implemented this approach in the City of Chicago as a case study. The proposed approach vastly improves the resolution of temperature predictions in cities, which will help the city with walkability, drivability, and heat-related behavioral studies. Moreover, we tested the model’s reliability on out-of-sample locations to investigate the application potentials to the other areas. This study also aims to gain insights into next-gen urban climate modeling and guide city observation efforts to build the strength for the holistic understanding of urban microclimate dynamics.","",https://doi.org/10.22541/essoar.168121520.07415257/v1,"",,

Cities are the centres of human activities. However, these are also places where high energy consumption and high carbon emissions are concentrated. This study selected data from 192 small and medium-sized cities in mainland China for the period 2000–2020. It classified these into seven categories using the K-means clustering method, calculated the decoupling status of different types of small and medium-sized cities based on the Tapio decoupling index, and analysed the relationship between carbon emissions and economic growth in various types of small and medium-sized cities based on the EKC curve theory. Finally, the backpropagation neural network (BPNN) model was used to classify and predict the time required to achieve carbon peaking for seven types of small and medium-sized cities. The following conclusions were drawn: (1) The development status of small and medium-sized cities shows a 'geese echelon pattern'. New dynamic small and medium-sized urban areas may reach peak carbon emissions first, while resource-based small and medium-sized urban areas may be the last to do so. (2) The decoupling of carbon emissions from industrial development in small and medium-sized cities has not been completed. This manifests mainly through the states of declining decoupling, absolute decoupling, and strong negative decoupling. (3) A significant inverted U-shaped relationship exists between economic development and carbon emissions in these cities. (4) These cities may have the disadvantage of premature or excessive de-industrialisation. Additionally, these generally have an inefficient and expansionary economic development status. Therefore, this study contended for a more robust integration of a radical political economy and ecological economics to support the development of such cities in China. The paper proposes differentiated development paths and fundamental recommendations for small and medium-sized cities in the implementation of the 'double carbon' strategy. The intention is to provide theoretical guidance and implications for promoting green and low-carbon development in urban and rural areas and for the early achievement of the strategy in China.","",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2023.111231,"",,

We divided the city into 100 × 100 m cells to calculate the cell image density (number of images in each cell) and the cell green index (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index of each cell) and assigned these values to each geotagged image. In addition, we also computed the popularity of each image (normalized views on the social network). We also categorized these images into two putative groups by photographer status (residents and tourists), with 80 images belonging to each group.

The rationale for collecting the water samples was to test and ascertain the level and source of contamination. A total of one hundred and eighty five samples were collected from sixteen districts. At each water point, a sample was collected using a sterile plastic container, which was pre-rinsed with the water to be sampled. Water samples were drawn from protected and unprotected springs, shallow wells, taps, rain tanks, water reservoirs, open and hand dug wells and boreholes and immediately transported on ice to the National Water Quality Reference Laboratory for analysis. At the laboratory, a BWB flame photometer, Ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) titration and gallery plus-thermos fisher discreet analyzer were used to analyze metal, nutrient and anion elements. On-site testing of dissolved oxygen, pH, electrical conductivity and turbidity was done using a water data sonde. This data can be used to draw comparative analyses of water quality issues in rural and urban districts and help in identifying the factors that influence water quality variations. The data can further be used for trend analysis and identifying long-term patterns whilst providing insights into pollution sources and the impact of environmental and climate change. Consequently, mathematical and machine learning models can use this data together with other parameters to predict the changes in water quality which information is essential for policy and decisions making. This data can be used by environmental scientists to draw insights into the health of the aquatic biodiversity; geospatial analysts to ascertain proximal water contaminants; public health specialists to analyze pathogens leading to water-borne diseases; water chemists to study the source and cause of water pollution; data scientists to perform predictive and descriptive analyses; and policy makers to formulate laws and regulations.","",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dib.2023.109601,"",,

The Chure region of the Sarlahi district in Nepal is a critical ecological zone that has experienced significant LULC changes in recent years. In this study, our aim was to apply a machine learning approach to detect LULC changes in the Chure region using Google Earth Engine (GEE) and the Random Forest classifier. We utilized Landsat imagery of 2007 and 2022 to generate land cover maps for each year, which were then compared to identify changes over time. The major findings of this study indicate that the forest cover in the region has increased by approximately 16% over the past 15 years, while the agriculture and built-up areas have also shown a significant increase. Conversely, the barren land and water areas have decreased. The classifier obtained an overall accuracy of 85.7% and a kappa coefficient of 81.2% for the year 2022, and an overall accuracy of 82.2% and a kappa coefficient of 76.8% for the year 2007, which demonstrates the high accuracy of the proposed approach. The use of GEE and random forest classifiers provided a cost-effective and efficient method for analysing large datasets and producing accurate LULC maps. Our findings can inform policymakers and conservationists about the need for sustainable land management practices to preserve the ecological integrity of the Chure region.

rayyan-210786389,"Emerging and re-emerging viral diseases, predisposing risk factors, and implications of international travel: a call for action for increasing vigilance and imposing restrictions under the current threats of recently emerging multiple Omicron subvariants",,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Viruses, especially single-stranded RNA viruses, have always been a pathogenic menace as they cause emerging infectious diseases such as Zika, Ebola, Bird Flu, Chikungunya, Dengue, MERS, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), Mokeypox, Marburg, Polio, and others. Of note, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 Delta and Omicron variants have posed significant global health impacts during the COVID-19 pandemic, co-circulation, and co-infections caused emergence of recombinant and hybrid variants, and eventually leading to different waves of surge in cases due to evasion of the vaccine (vaccine breakthrough) and infection induced immunity1. Currently, Omicron subvariants and lineages such as BA.1, BA.2, BA.3, BA.4, BA.5, and then BQ.1, BQ.1.1, BA.4.6, BF.7, BA.2.75.2, XBB.1 and BF.7 have created additional health burden, revealing escape from vaccine and viral infection induced protective immunity1–4. A significant surge in COVID-19 cases has been seen from time to time in 2022, and more recently, cases of COVID-19 are again being observed to be rising in a few countries, especially China, evidencing an unprecedented high rise owing to the Omicron BF.7 subvariant and thus posing fears of the feasibility of driving a new wave of pandemic ahead4,5. Therefore, while transmissibility and disease severity of most recently emerged Omicron subvariants are still being investigated, it is strongly encouraged to resume appropriate COVID-19 behavior protocols, adopt recommended prevention and control measures, especially airborne and contact precautions for avoiding infection, and also consider the significance of increasing vigilance and imposing restrictions on international travel, may be partial as deemed fit from time to time, unless and until the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic comes to an end. Many factors contribute to the emergence of viruses. Human factors include urbanization, globalization, immune status, demographics, and international travel. Environmental factors include weather and climate changes (El Niño effects), river damming (which affects the amount and distribution of possible viral vectors or hosts), tropical deforestation (forcing human-vector contact), ecological interactions, pollution, and disturbances to the equilibrium. Viral factors include the genetic makeup of the virus, viral genetic variations (mutation, reassortment, and recombination), and specific changes (antigenic shift and drift in the influenza virus). It is imperative to mention, that emerging viral diseases are zoonoses, which are predominantly spread by arthropods and nonhuman primates6. The emergence can be explained by the phenomenon of 'Microbial traffic' which refers to the mechanism through which infectious organisms can spread from animals to people or from isolated groups into new populations. A variety of activities boost microbial movement, promoting emergence and epidemics. In certain cases, the agents spread from their native habitat into the human population due to the many similarities. In other circumstances, infections that are already present in geographically isolated groups are given a chance to spread further. Unexpectedly, human actions often lead to the genesis of these outbreaks; occasionally, natural factors like climatic shifts can also play a role. The spread of new and re-emerging infectious illnesses throughout the world is facilitated in large part by international travel, the most recent great example being the COVID-19 pandemic7–9. The importation of infectious diseases has long been a concern that is disregarded in countries with developing economies, despite the fact that it poses a serious health issue Increases in the incidence of imported infectious diseases may be linked to the boom in worldwide travel and globalization. However, monitoring programs have not reflected the rise in imported infectious disease incidences because they do not adequately capture complete epidemiological data10,11. Most new infectious disease outbreaks start in animals, and this trend is growing as a result of human activity, including increased mobility and globalization, and shifting environmental conditions, such as climate change and global warming. The most vulnerable populations, vectors of transmission, fatality rate, and transmissibility (typically expressed as a basic reproduction number) vary greatly between different viral disease epidemics12. Despite these variations, policy responses to viral epidemics tend to be consistent over time and across countries. These responses include social isolation, quarantine, school closures, and information campaigns, as well as vector control campaigns for vector-borne viral diseases, personal protection, and vaccines. Strict mobility and travel limitations are being implemented for illnesses with a high potential for geographic spread coupled with significant case mortality13,14, and full high limitations as like during COVID-19 pandemic7,8. As the world becomes more interconnected and mobile, international travel and trade have become increasingly important in shaping the spread and resurgence of infectious illnesses. There are three ways in which travel is linked to the spread of disease: the disease first appears in an area that sees a lot of visitors; the behaviors of the tourists themselves may put them in danger; or the travelers themselves act as vectors to spread the agent to other places15,16. In the age of globalization, international travel has improved connectivity but it has also allowed the transmission of seeds of outbreak from one region to another7,8. This is further augmented by ecological factors, which typically precipitate emergence by bringing individuals into direct contact with a previously unknown but pre-existing natural reservoir or host for an infection (often a zoonotic or arthropod-borne infection), either by increasing proximity or, more frequently, by changing situations to support an increasing growth of the microbe or its natural host17. The recent COVID-19 pandemic and its long-lasting impacts have made us realize the importance of preventive measures and pandemic preparedness as well as emphasizing the importance of restrictions on international travel either partial or full bans on flights, and adopting adequate mitigation measures during travel7–9. International travel is increasingly becoming more regulated. However, political, economical, and emotional factors hinder timely action. It has been laid out in a catena of research that travel restrictions must be implemented quickly to postpone the peak of a future outbreak7. A stronger and more portable diagnostic framework can prevent emerging viral infections from becoming pandemics or epidemics by aiding in early diagnosis and treatment. Diagnostic criteria can include point-of-care (POC) testing and the incorporation of artificial intelligence (AI) into healthcare systems. However, the gold standard for diagnostic methods remains reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) for many emerging infections. POC molecular diagnostics significantly aid testing expansion, offer a portable, cost-effective solution, and eliminate the over-reliance on centralized laboratories18. POC can also measure different entities (viruses, antigens, and antibodies) that can contribute to the precise determination of an individual's health status. Early and accurate testing can decide a patient's clinical course and aid in management. However, a major challenge to this approach is the development and scaling of reliable methods for emerging infections for molecular detection and serologic assays in a timely fashion. AI can be used during outbreaks of emerging viral infections by detecting the transmission or predicting high-risk patients to help develop appropriate infection prevention and control (IPC) measures. AI can improve diagnostics by providing objective pattern recognition, standardizing the diagnosis of infections with IPC implications, and disseminating expertise in IPC19. The essence of the prevention of emerging viral infections is vaccines, and advances in science and technology have paved the ways for designing and developing effective, improved, and modern vaccines, including recombinant vaccines, vector-based vaccines, DNA vaccines, plant-based vaccines, CRISPR- and artificial intelligence-based vaccines, and others. We have seen repurposed vaccines having great success against certain emerging viruses, but had we been better prepared, we could have saved more people from mortality and morbidity caused by COVID-19. Furthermore, we need to refine the prophylactic and empirical treatment options. Most direct-acting antivirals take a 'one drug, one bug' approach by inhibiting proteins encoded by a single virus and end up being expensive yet inefficient against emerging infections. A possible cost-efficient solution in this domain is to target the host cell machinery or enzymatic functions shared by multiple viruses (broad-spectrum antivirals)20. Different interventions fall under the umbrella of 'travel-related control measures', including the complete closure of national borders to entry or exit, or both; travel restrictions reducing or stopping cross-border travel (e.g. denial of entry or exit based on nationality, travel history, health status, or other characteristics; suspension of travel via air, land, and sea); symptom/exposure-based screening at borders; test-based screening at borders; quarantine of travelers; wearing of face masks, and so on9,21,22. Taking precautions against the spread of infectious diseases through travel is a well-established method in public health. The widespread use of quarantine in medieval port towns and other areas helped stop the spread of bubonic plague. Recent epidemics have seen the implementation of similar procedures, such as airport exit screening and entry screening at national borders during the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 outbreak in 2019–2022, and airport exit screening during the Ebola outbreak in West Africa and the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 2014–201622. Considering that international travel plays a major role in the spread of emerging infectious pathogens, the authorities have imposed respiratory and hand hygiene for all travelers, but these interventions are not enough at a public health level. The travel regulations and restrictions form an immediate administrative need and have seen significant developments after COVID-19, laying the groundwork to manage future outbreaks too. Major citable examples are the 'travel bubbles' and 'vaccine passports'. A travel bubble is an arrangement, where bilateral air travel between two economically dependent countries is carried out given the testing protocols are maintained8. Another legislative tool is the 'vaccine passport'. These documents or certificates allow the authorities to ensure that all travelers are vaccinated23. In general, the timely imposition of appropriate restrictions on international travel could help prevent the spread of infectious diseases from one country to another. If the quarantine time is long enough and compliance is high, it should be possible to prevent the spread of the disease through tourists. Combining quarantine with PCR and POC diagnostic testing at borders is anticipated to increase efficiency. Studies have shown that the effectiveness of public health measures can vary widely depending on a variety of variables, including the prevalence of the disease in the community, the number of people who travel, the distance they travel, the types of public health measures already in place, and when they are implemented21,22. Better reporting, a variety of research approaches beyond modeling, and a societal assessment of the possible benefits and hazards of travel-related control measures are all necessary for future research. To save the world from the impacts of recently emerging multiple Omicron subvariants posing the feasibility of a new wave of COVID-19 pandemics, and other future pandemics, we recommend well-planned country-specific legislative policies for imposing time-to-time restrictions on international travel, enhancing more collaborative research for developing broad-spectrum antivirals and effective and newer vaccines, and strengthening preplanned structures for vaccine repurposing. Mitigation of the spread of Omicron subvariants warrants an integrated and collaborative IPC approach that combines masking, physical distancing, improving ventilation, increased testing, vigilance, tracking, isolation, quarantine, and awareness to counteract the COVID-19 pandemic in an effective way.

rayyan-210786417,Space technology: A powerful tool for safeguarding world heritage,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"The Convention Concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage (WHC), adopted by United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) on November 16, 1972, aims to ensure the identification, protection, conservation, presentation, and transmission to future generations of the world's cultural and natural heritage. The WHC works toward these goals by emphasizing the Outstanding Universal Value (OUV) of heritage sites and the unique contribution such places can make to conservation and human development agendas.1UNESCO, United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization. Operational Guidelines for the Implementation of the World Heritage Convention. Paris, France: UNESCO, 2021.Google Scholar As of the end of January 2023, the WHC has been signed by 194 state parties, covering 1,157 sites (including 900 cultural, 218 natural, and 39 mixed properties), 55 of which are considered to be in danger. These sites, totaling an area of more than 370 million hectares are designated as World Heritage (WH) sites (https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/). WH sites have played a significant role in the sustainable development of society globally and helped effectively maintain and preserve the cultural diversity and global biodiversity of the Earth.2Luo L. Wang X. Guo H. Contribution of UNESCO designated sites to the achievement of sustainable development goals.Innovation. 2022; 3100227Google Scholar However, WH sites around the world are experiencing significant impacts caused, in large part, by increasing anthropogenic threats (such as the rapid spread of urban sprawl, deforestation, resource overexploitation, air pollution, armed conflict, excessive tourism, and poor management).3Allan J.R. Venter O. Maxwell S. et al.Recent increases in human pressure and forest loss threaten many Natural World Heritage Sites.Biol. Conserv. 2017; 206: 47-55Crossref Scopus (104) Google Scholar There is also a range of overarching, long-term global challenges posed by climate change, extreme and severe weather events and geological hazards.4Vousdoukas M.I. Clarke J. Ranasinghe R. et al.African heritage sites threatened as sea-level rise accelerates.Nat. Clim. Chang. 2022; 12: 256-262Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar These threats, anthropogenic or otherwise, have put an unprecedented amount of pressure on the protection of both cultural and natural properties at the heritage sites. There is no conclusive solution to effectively protect heritage sties in the foreseeable future, and the public is becoming increasingly conscious about the negative impacts some anthropogenic activities have brought to heritage sites, exposing them to various risks for irreversible damage and loss. In light of this predicament, UNESCO, alongside its conservation partners, has been actively calling for the use of non-intrusive space technology (ST) to better evaluate and understand the detrimental factors surrounding WH sites and devise effective plans to mitigate negative impacts on OUV through the accurate identification, documentation, monitoring, and understanding of WH sites and their changes across large spatiotemporal scales. For this commentary, ST refers mainly to remote sensing (RS) based on Earth observation (EO) from space, as well as other geospatial information technologies such as geographic information systems (GIS) and global navigation satellite systems (GNSS). Even though ST was not developed intentionally for WH protection, it provides an advanced set of innovative and flexible tools that integrate scientific research into heritage science, which forms the evidential base to support measures for the protection of WH sites. ST also opens up paths of methodological innovation to facilitate future conservation of cultural and natural properties with new paradigms. On the basis of a half-century review of the applications of ST in the field of WH, we find that ST has effectively reshaped our means for WH conservation in four major domains of application: mapping, monitoring, modeling, and management of WH sites (Figure 1A). ST, as an objective and reliable ""eye"" from above for heritage experts, has enabled detailed mapping of heritages at various scales. This application commonly involves the acquisition and updatable analysis of multimodal datasets, combined with near real-time survey and investigation of WH sites and their contextual environments. ST is also an invaluable tool in identifying and designating potential new WH sites. The widespread integration of ST has played a crucial role in UNESCO's routine monitoring and emergency monitoring of cultural and natural heritages as a countermeasure to the challenges presented by global change. In particular, ST has made major contributions to fine-grained monitoring at very high resolutions in time and space and in assessing change caused by natural and/or anthropogenic processes. The combined application of RS, GIS, and augmented reality has facilitated the production of three-dimensional (3D) modeling of WH sites. In addition, photogrammetry and laser scanning can be used in WH surveys for generating 3D documentation of cultural and natural properties. Heritage information models of some popular WH sites have already been actively used in the fields of architecture study and digital ecology. The ability of ST to contribute to the conservation, planning, and management of WH sites has already been commonly used in the following domains: the definition of authenticity and integrity (AI), the mapping of OUV attributes of cultural and natural assets, the development and maintenance of heritage databases, 3D modeling and digital reconstruction, and informing WH management for sustainable development. The UNESCO WHC refers to its ""strategic objectives"" as the ""5 C's"": credibility, conservation, capacity building, communication, and communities.1UNESCO, United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization. Operational Guidelines for the Implementation of the World Heritage Convention. Paris, France: UNESCO, 2021.Google Scholar Here, we propose five key contributions (""5 D's"") of ST for conservation work involving WH sites (see Figure 1B): data, driver, discovery, digital transformation, and decision support. ST and the 5 D's, together with the WHC, constitute the ""turbine model"" for safeguarding WH that is proposed in this commentary and will assist in achieving the 5 C's over the next 50 years. By providing massive multi-source data, ST plays a crucial role in the WH governance chain. Archived data together with ongoing data acquisition record changes at WH sites and provide evidence for their conservation. The data collected through ST will, in turn, serve as an invaluable store of not only raw observations but also derivative products that can be extracted from imagery.5Levin N. Ali S. Crandall D. et al.World Heritage in danger: big data and remote sensing can help protect sites in conflict zones.Global Environ. Change. 2019; 55: 97-104Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar As a result of this data mechanism, ST will be able to mitigate the problem of lacunae in WH data by offering global coverage and consistency. ST is driving a revolution to become a new paradigm of WH protection. It provides advanced tools, such as RS data processing and GIS spatial analysis powered by machine learning, which can be used for dynamic monitoring and spatiotemporal analysis of changes that are occurring at WH sites. From this enhanced monitoring method, WH specialists and managers are empowered with the tools to monitor change over time and to assess whether conservation efforts to mitigate the impacts of natural and anthropogenic processes are contributing to positive outcomes toward sustainability. ST plays a key role in aiding frontier research across multiple disciplines related to heritage science. Scientific discoveries based on the use of new geospatial technologies and big EO data can be applied to the quantitative assessment of the state of WH protection. They can also be used to support deepened multidimensional interpretations of the OUV of WH sites, to guide the sustainable use of WH, and to improve accessibility so that all stakeholders may obtain unbiased and open information, thus increasing the credibility of WH as a global brand. ST provides a means of digital transformation that can be used for identifying, understanding, visualizing, presenting, and interpreting WH sites and their OUV in the digital space. In the future, ST will promote the transformation of WH protection through studies such as tangible heritage, digitalized heritage, or both. GIS-aided digital transformation will greatly improve the quality and efficiency of global communication and the dissemination of information related to WH sites, promoting public awareness of protection concepts and smoothing the implementation of actions. ST is becoming an invaluable tool to provide decision-making support along the entire chain of WH governance, from mapping to monitoring, modeling, and management. ST-based solutions could offer spatial intelligence to inform strategic decision making for multiple stakeholders, including local communities, WH sectors, institutions, and organizations. It offers an innovative path for capacity building and capacity enhancement in relation to the global governance of WH. These solutions are delivered in numerous ways, including databases, technologies, protocols, visualization platforms, and analytical systems. WH is under the influence of a wide array of anthropogenic and natural processes, giving the heritage bodies and national and international organizations promoting the preservation of WH sites an unprecedented opportunity to use science, technology, and innovation, including ST, to experiment innovative solutions and promote the role of WH in achieving sustainable development. Given that natural and anthropogenic challenges can present similar issues in various regions across the globe, it is evident that sharing knowledge and expertise, as well as developing collective strategies to leverage ST, while tailoring our methods to local circumstances, will be fundamental in developing a global approach for WH that is successful in the long run. The past 50 years of applications have resulted in continuous innovation in the development of ST to become powerful, cutting-edge tools for use in heritage documentation, monitoring, assessment and protection, and sustainable development. Although the progress is promising, we must underscore that relying solely on ST is insufficient; the greatest benefits are achieved by integrating ST with a variety of disciplines, such as management, economics, sustainability, sociology, education, ethics, politics, law, art, and aesthetics. Through closer and sustained engagement with a broader cross-section of society and local communities, ST can contribute to opening new horizons for WH protection over the course of the twenty-first century.

rayyan-210786433,Role of Satellite Precipitation Products in Real-Time Predictions of Urban Rainfall-Runoff by Using Machine Learning Modelling,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"The accurate prediction of runoff features such as water level and flow is valuable for planning and operation of urban drainage systems (UDS), especially for appropriately acting as flood control mechanisms during extreme rainfall events which are constantly impacted by climate change variables [1]. In addition, cost-effective design, and operation of flood control measures such as smart UDS require highly accurate rainfall predictions across the catchment area, i.e., intensity and duration [2]. Furthermore, sufficient lead time is needed to activate the control mechanisms on the UDS without affecting the accuracy of the predictions. It seems that the emerging use of satellite precipitation products (SPPs) is promising for obtaining predictions with longer lead times [3]. Hence, more exploration of potential runoff predictions by using SPPs is worth investigating to achieve a more accurate and longer lead time.This study employs a type of SPPs i.e., global precipitation measurement-integrated multi-satellite retrieval product (GPM-IMERG) to predict rainfall-runoff duration, peak and volume, as well as changes in flow over the course of the event at 30-minute intervals. In order to train and validate the machine learning model, the data from GPM-IMERG V06 was merged with ground data from the catchment precipitation gauge and flow sensor. The methodology is demonstrated by its application to the rainfall-runoff modelling of a real-world small urban sub-catchment area and its performance is evaluated by comparing it with the runoff predictions from physically based simulation models [4].Results show that while using SPPs solely can provide accurate predictions, significant improvement can be obtained when this data is integrated with ground monitoring data. The model output can be utilised for better design, planning and management of UDS technologies as flood control tools and consequently real-time operation of UDS in urban flooding.[1] Ferrans, P., Torres, M., Temprano, J., S&amp;#225;nchez, J., (2022).

rayyan-210786458,A multicriteria approach to prioritize urban sustainable development projects [Un approccio multicriteri per il ranking di progetti urbani sostenibili],,1,1,,,,,,,,it,,,"The current economic situation has highlighted the difficulties and fragility of some previous programmatic choices, which have strongly penalized Italian marginal areas. This has been further aggravated by the Ukrainian conflict and by the lengthening of the pandemic recession. Local planning has often proved to be unsustainable in the long-term due to its lack of global sustainability. Local projects are frequently developed and realized in situations of contingent needs, tight deadlines, and by below-strength staff, which do not allow for adequate and accurate overall planning. These difficulties have emerged and have particularly increased during the past year with the rising strain of responding promptly to the copious National and European funds released in support of the dual transition, established by the European Union. In this situation, it seems mandatory to support the marginal areas in their transition process and in their responsive and conscious participation in the allocated funding. The expectation is to finance projects with positive impacts and with long terms sustainable effects on the peripheral territories, increasing their competitiveness but mostly their socio-economic well- being. The aim of this study was to prioritize, through a multicriteria model, different projects in marginal areas according to their sustainability impact levels, in line with the European goals. This paper proposes an Absolute Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) model through a targeted selection of Urban Sustainability Indicators (USIs) to define the degree of sustainability of different urban projects. and their ranking in accordance with the National Recovery and Resilience Plan (NRRP) Missions. By examining the efficiency of the allocation of funds in maximizing the expected quantitative-qualitative impacts on marginal areas, this study allows to verify policy objectives. This paper may support future models able of ranking a large scale of urban projects on their sustainability impacts in marginal regions. The definition of scales of priorities can therefore become a useful tool capable of assisting territories in applying awareness to funds for projects with high sustainable impacts. L’attuale congiuntura economica negativa, aggravata dal conflitto ucraino e dal protrarsi della recessione pandemica, ha fatto emergere le difficoltà e le fragilità di alcune scelte programmatiche del passato che hanno penalizzato le aree interne del paese. Spesso l’attuazione e la pianificazione locale si è rivelata non sostenibile nel lungo termine, evidenziando la criticità di alcune scelte a scapito della sostenibilità globale di sistema. Frequentemente gli interventi locali vengono attuati in situazioni di necessità contingenti, scadenze già sollecitate, ed organici sottodimensionati, che non permettono una corretta e adeguata indagine programmatica e d’insieme. Tali complessità sono emerse e si sono acuite particolarmente durante quest’ultimo anno, alla luce della difficoltà di rispondere pronta- mente e strutturalmente agli innumerevoli bandi emanati su fondi nazionali ed europei per attuare la transizione duale in accordo con le direttive e gli obiettivi stabiliti dall’unione Europea. Supportare le aree in- terne nel loro processo di transizione e quindi nella loro partecipazione responsiva e consapevole ai finanziamenti stanziati, assume, quindi, un ruolo rilevante e di grande responsabilità. L’auspicio è che gli innumerevoli finanziamenti vengano direzionati da parte dei territori periferici verso progetti di impatto e con ricadute sostenibili nel lungo periodo, incrementando, non solo la loro competitività, ma anche, attraverso la loro efficacia, il proprio benessere socioeconomico. Lo scopo del presente studio è quello di definire, attraverso l’applicazione di un modello multicriteri, la scala di priorità di diverse progettualità sulle aree interne secondo criteri di sostenibilità, in coerenza con i goals europei. Il presente contributo propone, attraverso la selezione mirata di indicatori della sostenibilità urbana (USIs), un modello Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) assoluto in grado di definire il grado di sostenibilità e quindi di priorità dei progetti in coerenza con le missioni del Piano Nazionale di Ripresa e Resilienza (PNRR). Tale analisi permette di verificare gli obiettivi di policy, esaminando l’efficacia della ripartizione dei fondi per una massimizzazione quanti-qualitativa degli impatti attesi sul territorio. Tale lavoro è il punto di partenza per la creazione di modelli in grado di offrire una classificazione della sostenibilità di molteplici interventi urbani da attuare sulle aree marginali. La creazione di scale di priorità può quindi diventare uno strumento in grado di assistere i territori nell’accedere ai finanziamenti con una programmazione consapevole di impatto sostenibile.","",https://doi.org/10.48264/vvsiev-20233309,"",,
rayyan-210786470,Interpretation and Spatiotemporal Analysis of Terraces in the Yellow River Basin Based on Machine Learning,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"The Yellow River Basin (YRB) is a crucial ecological zone and an environmentally vulnerable region in China. Understanding the temporal and spatial trends of terraced-field areas (TRAs) and the factors underlying them in the YRB is essential for improving land use, conserving water resources, promoting biodiversity, and preserving cultural heritage. In this study, we employed machine learning on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform to obtain spatial distribution images of TRAs from 1990 to 2020 using Landsat 5 (1990–2010) and Landsat 8 (2015–2020) remote sensing data. The GeoDa software (software version number is 1.20.0.) platform was used for spatial autocorrelation analysis, revealing distinct spatial clustering patterns. Mixed linear and random forest models were constructed to identify the driving force factors behind TRA changes. The research findings reveal that TRAs were primarily concentrated in the upper and middle reaches of the YRB, encompassing provinces such as Shaanxi, Shanxi, Qinghai, and Gansu, with areas exceeding 40,000 km2, whereas other provinces had TRAs of less than 30,000 km2 in total. The TRAs exhibited a relatively stable trend, with provinces such as Gansu, Qinghai, and Shaanxi showing an overall upward trajectory. Conversely, Shanxi and Inner Mongolia demonstrated an overall declining trend. When compared with other provinces, the variations in TRAs in Ningxia, Shandong, Sichuan, and Henan appeared to be more stable. The linear mixed model (LMM) revealed that farmland, shrubs, and grassland had significant positive effects on the TRAs, explaining 41.6% of the variance. The random forest model also indicated positive effects for these factors, with high R2 values of 0.984 and 0.864 for the training and testing sets, respectively, thus outperforming the LMM. The findings of this study can contribute to the restoration of the YRB’s ecosystem and support sustainable development. The insights gained will be valuable for policymaking and decision support in soil and water conservation, agricultural planning, and environmental protection in the region.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/su152115607,"",,
rayyan-210786494,Study on the Spatial and Temporal Evolution of Regional Green Space Morphology Outside Built-Up Areas based on the Google Earth Engine and Biophysical Component Modeling,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"The spatial pattern of regional green space is an important dimension to describe and quantitatively express the characteristics of regional green spaces outside the built-up area of a city. With the expansion of urban and rural construction land, regional green space has been continuously encroached upon. This leads to a decline in regional ecological well-being and the loss of biodiversity. Based on the remote sensing data of Shanghai city from 2000 to 2020, we quantitatively studied the spatial morphological change characteristics of regional green space outside the built-up area of Shanghai city. Firstly, with the help of the GEE platform, the optimal decoding accuracy classification method was selected through machine learning (random forest, support vector machine, classification regression tree); then, based on the biophysical component (BCI) and CA binarization, the built-up area ranges for up to five time nodes were obtained; finally, through GIS spatial data analysis and processing technology, the regional green space dynamic data of Shanghai for five time nodes were extracted. Based on the above data, an analysis index system was constructed to quantitatively analyze the spatial morphology characteristics of the regional green space outside the built-up area of Shanghai. The results show that (1) the area of regional green space outside the built-up area of Shanghai had a fluctuating growth pattern of “decreasing and then increasing”. The arable land and water areas in Shanghai decreased, and the woodland area increased steadily, while the wetland and grassland areas showed a trend of first decreasing and then increasing. (2) The regional green patch fragmentation shows a fluctuating development trend of increasing, decreasing, and increasing. (3) The change in the spatial center of gravity of the regional green space in Shanghai had a high degree of consistency with the overall green space change. The center of gravity of the grasslands in the regional green space moved substantially to the northwest, while the center of gravity of the other types remained basically unchanged. This study reveals the spatial morphology characteristics of regional green spaces and provides a research method to study the dynamic changes in regional ecological resources. The results of this study can provide a scientific basis for the identification, protection, and development of regional ecological resources.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/land12122184,"",,
rayyan-210786611,Assessing land degradation neutrality in data scarce semi-arid drylands agroecosystems to improve land resources management: a case study in Matabeleland North Province of Zimbabwe.,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Semi-arid agroecosystems have a crucial function in supplying food and ecosystem services. However, these ecosystems are under severe threat due to land degradation. To enhance our understanding of environmental trends and their causes and to identify more sustainable land management techniques, it is important to track land degradation in space and time. This study uses land cover, soil organic carbon, and land productivity dynamics maps to evaluate land degradation neutrality (as per Sustainable Development Goal 15, indicator 15.3.1). In this regard, we employed the trends.earth tool in QGIS 3.3, utilising the European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative (ESA CCI) classified LULC maps for 1992, 2000, 2010, and 2020 to assess land degradation. Additionally, we predicted 2050 LULC maps using the MOLUSCE plugin in QGIS, which integrates an artificial neural network (ANN) in cellular automata (CA) modeling (CA-ANN) based on the 2015 LULC map and independent variables such as digital elevation model (DEM) and slope. Our results indicated a significant decrease in bare areas (71%) and an increase in settlements (built-up areas) (163%) between 1992 and 2020. Furthermore, the predicted land cover map shows a significant increase in bare land (238%) and settlements (72%), accompanied by a decrease in water bodies (23%) and forested areas (3.5%). In terms of land degradation, approximately 26.46% of the province exhibited degraded land, accounting for approximately 20,146.35 km , while approximately 59.55% (45,337.84 km ) of the land remained stable. Land cover conversions, particularly from forests to grasslands and settlements, are among the potential drivers of land degradation. Identifying land cover transitions and assessing land degradation is paramount for effective monitoring and planning. By understanding these dynamics, targeted interventions can be developed to mitigate land degradation and promote sustainable land use practices in semi-arid agroecosystems.","",https://doi.org/10.22541/au.168982569.96810532/v1,"",,

The important thing about these plans is to determine their success, efficiency, and feasibility. The expansion of the city comes because of the population increase or investment. When the expansion of cities precedes the updating of its master plans and the development of alternative plans to accommodate these expansions, it is normal that finds irregularities in use and differences between the master plan and real land use. Therefore, the main purpose of this paper is to examine the extent of illegal changes in the current situation in comparison with master plans. Also, the efficiency of artificial neural network models is evaluated to predict illegal land-use changes. The old master plan (1990-2010) and the new one (2010-2030) was used with two high-resolution satellite images dated 2010 and 2018. To determine changes between the status quo and the uses defined in the master plan, the required information tables were completed by field visit with questioner made for Al-hay City. Neural network models were used to evaluate the survey, data was divided into two parts training and testing then a neural network model was performed on them after testing the results using the neural network model, the results present that the accuracy of about 85% for the old master plan and pass 91% for the updated master plan.

rayyan-210786678,"Analyzing and managing human settlement growth in the Nile Valley, Egypt",,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Since the 1950s, Egypt's Nile Valley has faced accelerated settlement growth accompanied by relatively weak governance and coordination. Despite numerous spatial planning schemes aimed at controlling this rapid growth and preserving agricultural land, many urban and rural settlements have spread at the expense of the best fertile soils in the Nile Valley and Delta. With 98% of the population living in the Nile Valley and Delta (104 million inhabitants in 2022), more than one million acres of agricultural land have been lost to settlement growth between 1984 and 2004. Due to the decline in agricultural land, many problems, such as food insecurity, have arisen. , Staple foods, such as wheat which was once an export product, are now imported. Settlement growth has also had socioeconomic consequences, such as unemployment: it is estimated that the loss of one acre can lead to the loss of one direct job and 0.7 indirect jobs. Though many studies have addressed settlement growth on agricultural land in Egypt, there is a lack of studies that: (1) analyze the types and patterns of settlement growth in the Nile Valley; (2) analyze the policies that affect settlement growth in the Nile Valley; (3) examine the prevailing driving forces and causal mechanisms of settlement growth from a multidimensional perspective; and (4) simulate future spatial settlement growth in the Nile Valley considering current policies and alternative policy directions. Therefore, this research sought to develop a methodology that provides insight into the phenomenon of unplanned settlement growth in the Nile Valley and addresses the aforementioned gaps. This Nile Valley Region is approximately 1,000 km (in length) with an average width of 12 km, and it encompasses eight governorates, of which Assiut Governorate was chosen as a case study. The research was based on three objectives. First, the physical aspects of Assiut's expansion of human settlements were examined. Initially, the impact of the 2005 land use plan and the political upheaval in 2011 were assessed through the analysis of settlement expansion during the period 2005 to 2020 (the plan's lifespan). The time frame was then extended to include 1999 in order to compare the situation before and after the 2005 land development plan’s implementation. The built-up area was extracted from four LANDSAT TM images (2005, 2010, 2015, and 2020) using symbolic machine learning. A QGIS Growth Classifier was then applied to identify settlement growth types, starting from a land use map of 1999 that was created in preparation for the 2005 plan. The results quantify eight different kinds of human settlement growth over four time periods (from 1999:2005; 2005:2010; 2010:2015; and 2015:2020) and show that administration approaches and spatial designs to manage unplanned development on agrarian land have been ineffective. All time periods saw significant unplanned growth, albeit with some variations. Also, there is evidence to suggest that the general political instability brought about by the Arab Spring in 2011 resulted in a higher rate of unplanned growth in the 2010:2015 period, as landowners took the power vacuum as an opportunity to build with little regard for possible sanctions.Second, the research identified why and how unplanned settlement growth occurs in the study area. It was necessary to identify and analyse the institutional and policy frameworks for managing settlement growth, highlight the main driving forces and derive the causal mechanisms linking these forces. In-depth interviews, conducted with local stakeholders, were the primary data source for this objective. First, based on previous studies, the actors influencing unplanned settlement growth were identified. Second, the interview guide was designed and 12 government and 42 civil society stakeholders were interviewed to identify the driving forces for unplanned settlement growth. The interview transcripts were analysed using Template Analysis, to extract 26 driving forces. for unplanned settlement growth in Assiut. These forces are related to three main dimensions: institutional and political (15 forces); cultural (3 forces); and economic (8 forces). Several of these institutional and political forces are related to poor governance (e.g., top-down decision-making process, lack of transparency, low capacity of local public servants, administrative fragmentation, corruption, and weak law enforcement). Land fragmentation, return on agricultural investment, and land market were the main economic themes. While the Ezwah concept, ensuring the future of family successors, and the social stigmatization of renting (in) were the main cultural forces.Meanwhile, the land policy was analysed to assess the impact of formal institutions. The Institutional Resource Regime framework (IRR) was used to analyse property rights and public policies related to land. In light of the internal assessment of property rights and public policy towards land ownership and use, housing, and agriculture, it was concluded that the land system in the Nile Valley developed from a relatively simple regime to a complex regime. This increasing complexity, with the division of commands and obligations among numerous agencies and several levels of administration, has led to unsustainable land use practices. Based on the stakeholder interviews and the IRR results, a causal mechanism for unplanned growth was derived. The IRR was used to identify the role of formal institutions in this mechanism, while the in-depth interviews revealed the informal institutions that contribute to unplanned growth and, accordingly, the causal mechanism. The incoherent land regime is a significant factor in unplanned settlement growth, as it cannot meet the high demand for land for housing in the Nile Valley. Land scarcity, lack of enforcement capacity, informal institutions such as the Kahoul (a stand-in for illegal landowners who accepts criminal prosecution in exchange for payment), and widespread corruption amongst land officials, result in legal restrictions on settlement growth being overridden.The third research objective was to develop scenario-based spatial simulations to provide insight into potential future settlement growth patterns. Six scenarios for the future settlement growth in Assiut up until 2030 were simulated using Spatial Logitsic Regression and Cellular Automata using six main driving forces. The six scenarios demonstrate that settlement growth patterns would be influenced by the degree of law enforcement and the annual growth rate of settlement growth. The amount of settlement growth on agricultural land simulated ranges from: 9.2 km2 (1% p.a. growth); 46 km2 (5 % p.a.); and 101.2 km2 (11% p.a.).The research has some general methodological contributions as well as specific contributions for the Egyptian context. From a methodological perspective, this study bridges the gap between qualitative and quantitative approaches for analysing unplanned settlement growth; it demonstrates the practical value of open-source data and software by tuning JRC’s global human settlement layer (GHSL) data with their source software (MASADA 1.3) to the specific context (Assiut Governorate); and combining several different methods to explore formal and informal land institutions. Specific contributions for the Egyptian context are enhancing the understanding of the phenomenon of unplanned human settlement growth in the Nile Valley from a multidimensional perspective, considering the questions of where, when, why, and how unplanned human settlement growth occurs there. The results of this study can be considered as a warning sign for the developers of the 2052 vision for land development in Egypt, that informal settlement development in the Nile Valley will be difficult to regulate.","",https://doi.org/10.3990/1.9789036556576,"",,
rayyan-210786736,Boosting Few-Shot Learning in Remote Sensing Leveraging an Auxiliary Generator through Contrastive Learning,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Remote sensing technology has revolutionized the way we perceive and interact with our planet, enablingus to acquire invaluable information about our environment, natural resources, and ecosystems. Frommonitoring land use changes to studying climate patterns and disaster management, remote sensing hasbecome an indispensable tool for scientific research and practical applications. However, the effective application of remote sensing data often relies on the ability to classify andinterpret these vast and complex datasets. This presents a substantial challenge, as remote sensing datatypically exhibit high dimensionality, encompassing diverse terrain types, weather conditions, andimaging modalities. Furthermore, acquiring labeled data for supervised machine learning approaches isoften arduous, time-consuming, and expensive in remote sensing contexts. Few-shot learning emerges as a promising paradigm to address these issues. It seeks to develop modelscapable of learning from a limited amount of labeled data, which is a common scenario in remote sensingapplications due to the cost and effort associated with ground truth data collection. Few-shot learning isespecially valuable in cases where we need to recognize previously unseen classes or adapt quickly tochanging conditions, such as tracking forest fires or monitoring urban development. Despite its potential, few-shot learning in remote sensing faces significant hurdles, such as inadequatemodel generalization, limited data diversity, and challenges in feature extraction from complex datasources. In recent years, several advancements have been made in remote sensing image analysis, including the integration of deep learning techniques, but there remains a critical need for improving few- shot learning capabilities in this domain. This paper introduces a novel approach to address the limitations of few-shot learning in remote sensing. We propose the incorporation of an auxiliary generator powered by contrastive learning, a technique thathas demonstrated success in diverse applications, from natural language processing to computer vision. This auxiliary generator, working in conjunction with our few-shot learning model, enhances the ability todiscriminate between different classes and adapt to new remote sensing scenarios with limited labeleddata","",https://doi.org/10.31219/osf.io/2v46h,"",,

In this study, the growth and development of the urban areas of Al-Diwaniyeh during the recent decades using three categories: 1. urban limits layer extracted from land use maps during the period, 2. population density layers and 3. Degree of urbanization in the period 1975 to 2015 It was investigated, monitored and modeled. Modeling and forecasting for the future was done using layers of population density and degree of urbanization. The population density map for 2025 was implemented based on population changes in the last two decades using the multilayer artificial neural network method. While the prediction of the degree of urbanization was operationalized by creating and applying a multi-layer neural network model for 2030. The results of the study showed that the general trend of the expansion of Al-Diwaniye city limits during the period of 1975 to 205 was increasing. The degree of urbanization in Al Diwaniyah has been increasing since 1975. After 1975, the initial cores of the dense areas were formed, and gradually, in the following periods, the expansion of the urban areas of Al-Diwaniyeh was observed around the cores. The class of rural areas has shown an upward trend with a more uniform slope compared to other classes of the degree of urbanization. While after 1990, high density and low density classes with close areas have also gone through an upward trend. The rate of population density and, accordingly, the rate of population in Al-Diwaniye has been increasing between 1975 and 2015. The trend of maximum population changes has been downward; therefore, it can be claimed that the initial dense cores of the urban population of Al-Diwaniyeh have moved to the surrounding areas. In the estimated degree of urbanization in 2030, the class with high density has faced a decrease in area compared to the previous period. In general, the area of ​​built-up areas in 2030 will increase compared to previous periods, but this will be achieved with a slower acceleration and slope compared to previous periods.","",https://doi.org/10.30574/gjeta.2023.14.3.0045,"",,
rayyan-210786942,Envisioning urban environments resilient to vector-borne diseases: a protocol to study dengue in Vietnam,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Transmitted primarily by Aedes aegypti (Ae. aegypti) and Aedes albopictus (Ae. albopictus), arboviral diseases pose a major global public health threat. Dengue, chikungunya, and Zika are increasingly prevalent in Southeast Asia. Among other arboviruses, dengue and Zika are becoming more common in Central and South America. Given human encroachment into previously uninhabited, often deforested areas, to provide new housing in regions of population expansion, conceptualizing built urban environments in a novel way is urgently needed to safeguard against the growing climate change-driven threat of vector-borne diseases. By understanding the spread from a One Health perspective, enhanced control and prevention can be achieved. This is particularly important considering that climate change is likely to significantly impact the persistence of ponded water where mosquitoes breed due to increasing temperature and shifting rainfall patterns with regard to magnitude, duration, frequency, and season. Models can incorporate aquatic mosquito stages and adult spatial dynamics when habitats are heterogeneously available, thereby including dispersal and susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered (SEIR) epidemiology. Coupled with human population distribution (density, locations), atmospheric conditions (air temperature, precipitation), and hydrological conditions (soil moisture distribution, ponding persistence in topographic depressions), modeling has improved predictive ability for infection rates. However, it has not informed interventional approaches from an urban environment perspective which considers the role of ponds/lakes that support green spaces, the density of population that enables rapid spread of disease, and varying micro-habitats for various mosquito stages under climate change. Here, for an example of dengue in Vietnam, a preventive and predictive approach to design resilient urban environments is proposed, which uses data from rapidly expanding metropolitan communities to learn continually. This protocol deploys computational approaches including simulation and machine learning/artificial intelligence, underpinned by surveillance and medical data for validation and adaptive learning. Its application may best inform urban planning in low-middle income countries in tropical zones where arboviral pathogens are prevalent.","",https://doi.org/10.37349/edht.2023.00004,"",,

This paper focuses on the vehicle license plate-based management, a sort of policy intervention understudied in environmental governance literature. Specifically, we study the automobile purchase restriction (APR), a major method of license management to address urban air pollution and traffic congestion recently launched by the authorities of China. However, limited studies have quantified the environmental impact of such purchase restriction. Based on the panel data of PM2.5 concentration in 330 cities in China during 1998-2016, this study aims to explore the causal impact of Beijing automobile purchase restriction on air quality, using the regression control method and high-dimensional data regression of machine learning. The average PM2.5 concentration did not decrease but increased because of the purchase restriction. Over time, the deterioration effect on urban air quality will not alleviate. Besides, the restriction cannot enhance urban air quality by decreasing the increase of PM2.5. Despite excluding the impact of driving restriction, the purchase restriction markedly aggravate urban air quality. This paper has some policy implications for policymakers on the impact of urban vehicle license management with caution. Hence, it is essential to promote urban economy, production, and lifestyle to attain the win-win goal of air pollution control and urban development.&lt;/p&gt;","",https://doi.org/10.58567/jes01010006,"",,
rayyan-210786993,Social justice implications of&amp;nbsp;smart urban technologies:&amp;nbsp;an intersectional approach,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Techno-optimistic visions around smart buildings, homes, cities, grids, healthcare, etc. have become ubiquitous over the past decade. Using variations of machine learning and artificial intelligence, smart urbanism (SU) envisions an efficient, digital society. However, research shows that smart technologies reinscribe inequalities by prioritising the interests of the free market, technology-centric governance and data monetisation. Although there has been a growing concern over the injustices SU perpetuates, there is a lack of systematic engagement with power systems such as capitalism or heterosexism that underpin SU visions. A novel framework is presented that situates intersectional justice at the heart of SU. A mapping of 70 cases of ‘trouble’ with the promises of SU is used to address three core research questions: What are the ‘troubles’ with SU? To what extent are they intersectional? What can intersectionality add to the development of a just SU? The analysis shows how SU politics play out in relation to how users are understood and engaged, how different actors institutionalise SU and how dominant power systems are challenged. The presented strategy contributes to understanding not just the data politics in urban spaces, but also how they can be renegotiated and re-evaluated to solve multiple and interconnected urban crises without compromising on social justice. Practice relevance Citizen-led initiatives against SU should commit to intersectionality’s radical core to dismantle power structures to ensure local smart urban projects do not entrench global business-as-usual neoliberal agendas. Intersectional thinking can create spaces for deliberative dialogues between civil society groups and build alliances across groups that seek to challenge the hegemony of exclusionary urban policies. Urban planners and local governments, which are at the forefront of SU applications, should decentre technologies and rather focus efforts on working out how smart technologies can work in conjunction with other kinds of urban interventions, such as social, economic and environmental policy changes, collaborative planning, community development, etc. to herald more just urban futures. Designers of smart urban technologies should apply intersectional approaches to further challenge ‘Homo economicus’ (rational, White, technophilic, able-bodied) as the primary user type and to replace it with diverse user archetypes that express humanity, justice and generosity.","",https://doi.org/10.5334/bc.290,"",,
rayyan-210787028,Benchmarking Deep Learning Architectures for Urban Vegetation Points Segmentation,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Vegetation is crucial for sustainable and resilient cities providing various ecosystem services and well-being of humans. However, vegetation is under critical stress with rapid urbanization and expanding infrastructure footprints. Consequently, mapping of this vegetation is essential in the urban environment. Recently, deep learning for point cloud semantic segmentation has shown significant progress. Advanced models attempt to obtain state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets, comprising multiple classes and representing real world scenarios. However, class specific segmentation with respect to vegetation points has not been explored. Therefore, selection of a deep learning model for vegetation points segmentation is ambiguous. To address this problem, we provide a comprehensive assessment of point-based deep learning models for semantic segmentation of vegetation class. We have selected seven representative point-based models, namely PointCNN, KPConv (omni-supervised), RandLANet, SCFNet, PointNeXt, SPoTr and PointMetaBase. These models are investigated on three different datasets, specifically Chandigarh, Toronto3D and Kerala, which are characterized by diverse nature of vegetation and varying scene complexity combined with changing per-point features and class-wise composition. PointMetaBase and KPConv (omni-supervised) achieve the highest mIoU on the Chandigarh (95.24%) and Toronto3D datasets (91.26%), respectively while PointCNN provides the highest mIoU on the Kerala dataset (85.68%). The paper develops a deeper insight, hitherto not reported, into the working of these models for vegetation segmentation and outlines the ingredients that should be included in a model specifically for vegetation segmentation. This paper is a step towards the development of a novel architecture for vegetation points segmentation.","",https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2306.10274,"",,
rayyan-210787146,From near real-time urban data to an explainable city-scale model to help reduce the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract Urbanization is associated with increasing the temperature of urban areas and phenomena like the Urban Heat Island (UHI). The latter produces a sensible impact on people’s health, quality of life, urban liveability, and even the mortality rate. As a result, reducing high temperatures in cities will improve the quality of life in cities. Overall, the understanding of the relationship between UHI and urban features is not well captured due to a lack of accessibility to data and cost implications related to long-term monitoring and simulation processes. Machine Learning (ML) offers significant opportunities to develop approaches that lead to high accuracy in discovering the significant features of buildings and urban areas, improving the conditions of the inhabitants. The paper aims to describe how the actual spatial data of Tallinn, Estonia, were assessed and applied to build an Explainable ML-based model. The study outcomes include the ML-based models that help understand the importance of urban features and their value in developing strategies and solutions to mitigate the UHI effect. The study’s findings show that changes in the most important features of urban areas and buildings, such as the built area in the neighborhood zone and the area and orientation of buildings, play the most significant role in transforming an urban area from one with no UHI effect to one that experiences heat waves. The results provide essential information for urban planners who implement built environments.","",https://doi.org/10.1088/1742-6596/2600/9/092012,"",,

However, the distribution of street greenery is imbalanced. Therefore, to explore the differences in street greening levels within urban cities, we crawled streetscape data using the Internet to assess the spatial distribution patterns of urban street GVI using deep learning and spatial autocorrelation, and combined 11 surrounding environmental features with multi-source geographic data to further analyze the key factors influencing the spatial variation of block GVI using ordinary least squares (OLS), geographically weighted regression (GWR) models, and multi-scale geographically weighted regression (MGWR) models. The results show that the mean value of GVI in Fuzhou City is low (23.08%), with large differences among neighborhoods and a significant spatial autocorrelation. Among the regression models, MGWR has the best fit with an R2 of 0.702, where the variables of NDVI, house price, accessibility of water bodies and parks, and the proportion of built-up land have a greater impact on GVI, and the factors do not have the same spatial effect size.

Anthropogenic activities are the primary NO 2 sources affecting the planetary ecosystems. The Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) on board AURA Missions is one of the most robust projects contributing to the NO 2 investigation. A methodological coupling based on spatial analysis, clustering, machine learning, and statistical validation helped to analyze the OMI satellite data and its interactions with socioeconomic factors. Spatial contrasts show differences between continental and marine domains, highlighting the influence of coastal urban centers on the near marine areas; differences between hemispheres and latitudinal changes overall in the Pacific and Atlantic oceans; contrasts between urban and rural areas in continents; and outstanding regions by their high NO 2 emissions. The trend analysis outlined regional contrasts that contribute to understanding the impact of economic activities and environmental policy implementation. From 2005 to 2021, trend patterns characterization established the framework to correlate the population size and the GDP of more than 250 developed urban centers worldwide. Prominent maximum NO 2 densities between 2011 and 2013 stand out among the four trend patterns, outlining a point inflection (peak component) in the trend direction of several regions. The correlation, including all cities, followed a significant moderate relationship (R=0.573, p~0.000) where the population explained 33.7% of the productivity. However, the correlations by subgroups considering trend pattern classification indicated significant moderate to strong relationships for almost all trend types (R from 0.689 to 0.814, p~0.000), where the population explains 47.5 to 66.2% of the productivity. These results partially show the direct cause-effect relationship between the high NO 2 emissions and development levels in urban centers. Conversely, the wide scattering in such correlations suggests the gradual and positive effects of Environmental policies in favor of better air quality, different from the sudden decrease in NO 2 densities caused by confinement and preventive measures against COVID-19.","",https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-3778772/v1,"",,

The rapid growth of cities, owing to rural-urban migration and high birth rate has resulted in encroachment of the land use and land cover (LULC) in the Cape Flats, situated north of Cape Town, Western Cape, South Africa. PlanetScope imagery and K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) classifier are used to map and monitor the following LULC classes within the Cape Flats; waterbodies, trees, built-up, and vegetation, we further do a time series map between 2016 and 2021.The results showed that LULC changes between 2016 to 2021 are as follows: a decrease of 2.1% in vegetation, 0.4% in water bodies, and 11% in trees. Built-up areas, on the other hand, showed a significant increase of 13.6% over five years. The LULC changes in the Cape Flats were mainly triggered by an increase in built-up areas due to household construction to accommodate the increased population resulting from rural-to-urban migration and high birth rate. Classification accuracy from 2016 and 2021 was as follows; overall accuracy of 98.31% and 0.97 kappa coefficient in 2016, while overall accuracy 96.54% and kappa coefficient 0.95 in 2021. A combination of machine learning and high-resolution imagery showcased that high classification results can be achieved in monitoring subtle LULC changes. We recommended that all relevant stakeholders, including government officials and municipalities, formulate and adopt policies to protect against LULC degradation.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/isprs-archives-xlviii-1-w2-2023-967-2023,"",,
rayyan-210787436,Urban morphology on the southern African periphery,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Urban form in African cities is dynamic, unpredictable and in constant flux. Urban morphology remains mostly undocumented in Southern Africa as an emerging region. Current processes of informal land occupation, changing suburbia and incremental settlement transformation patterns present fragile, yet interesting morphological characteristics that are worthy of interpretation. How are we understanding, representing, and anticipating changing southern urban form and what is the value-add of understanding urban morphology in Southern Africa? In the absence of any formalised network of ISUF in Southern Africa, there is the potential to make a meaningful contribution to urban morphology and its associated processes and agents. Three case study perspectives from practice, research and teaching are explained to understand urban form in South Africa, as follows: 1). community-led data collection on urban form and social practice based on evidence from experiences in Cape Town townships; 2). area-based partnerships based on examples from informal settlement upgrading in Khayelitsha; and 3). deliberate and engaged teaching and learning currently taking place in the urban design programme at the University of Cape Town. Urban morphological approaches in the global south must be multi-scalar, relevant, valuable, and most importantly, affordable. This requires stripping out of irrelevant principles and techniques and focusing on low-cost, low maintenance and sustainable AI and labour-intensive of understanding the changing city. The future development of African cities needs to take a significant stand on the role of socio-economic realities, political action, local agency, and their relationships with urban form.","",https://doi.org/10.5937/saj2302198e,"",,
rayyan-210787448,Coexistence and collaboration: Our Institute’s 2023 conference in Perth,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"I am writing this editorial on a very wintery day in Hobart, Tasmania, after returning from a convivial and interesting week at the Institute of Australian Geographers’ annual conference, held on unceded lands of the Whadjuk people of the Noongar Nation at the Bentley campus of Curtin University in Perth. Organised by a team from Curtin and the University of Western Australia and led by Tod Jones and Kirsten Martinus, the conference theme was coexistence, collaboration, and geography. For Jones and Martinez, “the theme recognises that the planet’s health and the human race’s survival are inextricably linked and that research outcomes are enriched by diverse partnerships and the contribution of individuals from many specialities” (see Miller, 2023). In 220 sessions over four days, over 235 attendees from 13 nations met in pre-conference workshops, plenaries, and study group and independent sessions to deliberate on that theme and other concerns central to our discipline and the professions it underpins. We were all privileged to be welcomed to Country by Kim Collard, an Elder and Balladong/Wilmen man of the Noongar Nation, who spoke to us about NAIDOC Week, the lands upon which we were meeting, and the special meeting of song lines on the Bentley campus. I note in passing and with gratitude that Wiley has selected three of our journal’s articles to feature in its own NAIDOC tribute (see here; Clements et al., 2023; Rawluk et al., 2023; Rogers et al., 2023). The team at Geographical Research, supported by Wiley and the Institute’s Council again hosted two lectures in Perth. First, Professor Mark Gahegan gave the Wiley Lecture, and it was riveting. A computer scientist and geographer based at the University of Auckland, Mark’s research includes geovisualisation, spatial analysis, geocomputation, and remote sensing. On this occasion, he shared fascinating insights on ChatGPT and artificial intelligence (AI) and, crucially, invited geographers to apply our interdisciplinarity capacities to help ensure AI futures involve empowering outcomes. Second, Dr Emma Ligtermoet gave the Fay Gale Memorial Lecture, and it was just as compelling. A CSIRO post-doctoral fellow and human-environment geographer from the University of Western Australia and Australian National University, Emma investigates how people navigate social-ecological change in freshwater and coastal environments. In this instance, her focus was on collaborative work in Pilbara communities committed to deepening coexistence work between Country and people. Thanks to Connor Goddard (Curtin) and Linda Wilson (University of Western Australia), I was privileged to host a conversation about writing and publishing with a group of around 50 higher degree research candidates. Some of the topics we explored included (a) why publishing matters intrinsically, strategically, and tactically; (b) how writing helps academics think, feel, speak, read, and plan careers—and how we can write and still balance work and life; (c) what it means to start the writing and publishing journey; (d) how a little insider knowledge about the higher education sector and academic practice can help that journey; and (e) why journal publishing matters but is not the whole story. At the end of our conversation, I elicited feedback and ideas about what else we can do to support candidates. Among the ideas are the following: What is the lived experience of sustained writing like in terms of process? How can we start and continue to write while living with the realities of precarious and challenging employment contexts? Does everything we write have to be accessible to the general public? How can we better reach out to diverse publics? What are the blessings and challenges of co-authorship and how do we retain agency in those relationships? How can I become a remarkable editor of my own writing? These are intriguing questions indeed, and I hope we can begin to address some of them in our webinars, co-hosted by the Institute and Wiley (see here for past episodes). Last but not least, I am delighted to report that the 2022 Wiley prize recipients for highly esteemed papers were also announced at the conference dinner. The three papers, all available in our journal website, are by Hine et al. (2022), Roelofsen and Carter-White (2022), and Tan and Liu (2022). Our warmest congratulations to all three writing teams, and our thanks to Wiley as well. As has become a practice for our journal, we begin this third issue of the year with a commentary by one of our associate editors, Clare Mouat (2023). Her focus is upon the ways in which regenerative—indeed loving—interventions are urgently needed to support radically positive pedagogies, policies, and geographical practices. Pushing back against tendencies to despair, Mouat invites readers to consider love as a critical lens in contemporary geography and to interrogate what that might mean in methodological terms for research, learning and teaching, and engagement. We would welcome more work on such agendas in this journal. Next is an important and deeply synthesising editorial by Rogers and Kearnes (2023), included in this issue but/and/also fronting our recent virtual issue on COVID-19—a collection of papers published since the pandemic’s outbreak that have been brought together in one convenient place. Beyond summarising the 18 papers included in the virtual issue, Rogers and Kearns carefully show how different papers are aligned to particular themes related to the geographies of COVID-19 mobilities COVID-19 governance; the urban geographies of the pandemic; its material geographies; its spatio-temporalities; and its pedagogic affects and effects. These foundational papers will be added to in coming months as we finalise a second tranche of papers on “legacies and anticipatory geographies of the pandemic including a few papers already published in the journal and assigned to issues but not yet in a virtual issue.” In this third issue, we also feature our 2022 Wiley Lecture, given by Gemma Sou (2023) and entitled “Communicating climate change with comics: life beyond apocalyptic imaginaries.” This paper includes both sophisticated analysis of complex challenges related to climate change and a video abstract that bring to life Sou’s comics and conceptual and empirical insights about the power of anti-essentialist representations of people’s experiences of extreme weather events. A series of fascinating original articles follow Sou’s work. We lead with “Tomorrow’s country: practice-oriented principles for Indigenous cultural fire research in south-east Australia” by Andrea Rawluk et al. (2023). The paper models how a group of Indigenous and settler academics, practitioners, and experts have worked to identify a range of practice-oriented principles to support cultural fire management and research. Those principles include trust, reciprocity, and an acknowledgement of power relations and differing values. Consideration is then given by Ryan van den Nouwelant et al. (2023) to crucial questions about “Private rental investment and socio-spatial disadvantage in Sydney, Australia.” The work is based in Sydney, Australia, and focuses on small-scale rental property owners who, over the period from 1991 to 2016, sought high rental yields from low capital outlays. Analysing the spatial correlation between tenure and suburbanisation, the authors show how owners’ actions are linked both to uneven growth rates of private rental and to region’s geographies of social disadvantage. In work by Angus Dowell et al. (2023), readers are next invited to consider “Experimentation as infrastructure: enacting transitions differently through diverse economy-environment assemblages in Aotearoa New Zealand.” Their study deploys social studies of economisation and marketisation (SSEM) to consider economic development initiatives in New Zealand. Importantly, it taps into geographers’ interests in experimentation, agency, and practice in relation to emergent forms of environmental economy. Then, Maria Ribeiro et al. (2023) report on work to understand the “Spatial and temporal dynamics of the urban heat island effect in a small Brazilian city” of Sacramento in western Minas Gerais. Noting how urban growth and climate change are predicted to increase substantial warming in inland cities, they deploy a local climate zone (LCZ) system approach to data about the city’s climate and weather. In the process, they identify factors driving thermal changes and argue that the approach is replicable in other South American cities so that urban planning can account for emergent challenges across the region. Last, Busola Adedokun et al. (2023) document how, on the Central Plateau of Tasmania, there has been “A long entanglement with nature: flyfishers in the wild.” Flyfishers there can be described as having “membership” of groups with varied motivations and attitudes related to their social, trophy, outdoor enthusiast, and hunter-gatherer proclivities. Overarching those differences, however, is a common love of wild nature; a concern for the negative effects of social and environmental challenges such as weeds, dogs, trampling, and fire; and a preparedness to help keep such areas unspoiled. Such qualities suggest they have potential to support park management. As always, thanks to everyone on the team, our board, our reviewers, authors, publisher, and Institute. And that, as they say, is that … until our final issue of 2023, due in November. Until then, stay safe and well.","",https://doi.org/10.1111/1745-5871.12617,"",,

Held biennially since 2004, the ICEEG Conference is one of the most important events for geophysical research and applications in environmental and engineering. Drawing together scientists, engineers, industrial delegates and end-users, the conference is a place to see all of the advanced developments, ranging from fundamental achievement in geophysical methods to the most interesting case studies. Traditionally, the proceedings “ Engineering Environmental Geophysics and Intelligent Detection Technology ” of the 10th International Conference on Environment and Engineering geophysics is published for the readers from the near-surface geophysics community Shallow surface geophysics refers to the exploration theory and application research on the surface of the earth using physical principles and methods. The shallow surface supports the needs of human survival and development. On the one hand, human beings obtain water and minerals from it, and build the necessary underground space to contain water, electricity, gas, communication, transportation and other pipe network systems in modern cities. On the other hand, various kinds of waste generated by human activities is discharged and buried in it, forming a unique geological layer of the Anthropocene. Whether from the technical level (physics) or non-technical level (politics, society, law), shallow surface geophysics is becoming more and more important. Artificial intelligence technology has been widely used in various fields in recent years, and the construction of smart cities cannot be separated from the support of shallow surface geophysical exploration and monitoring methods and technologies.

Foreword Prof. Walter Leal Filho (PhD, DSc, DPhil, DTech, DEd) Chair, Inter-University Sustainable Development Research Programme The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in September 2015 provide a universal call to action to end poverty, protect the planet and ensure that by 2030 all people enjoy peace and prosperity. They also entail elements of importance towards a strategic business engagement with sustainability issues. These offer a framework which provides businesses with a systematic approach to identify new business opportunities whilst contributing to the solution of the grand sustainability challenges facing the world today, including climate change. Each SDG, if achieved, will have a direct and significant positive impact on millions of people's lives around the world and the environment in which they live. Businesses have an opportunity to widen the purpose of business through adopting the SDGs as targets for their operations. Thus, they can make a meaningful contribution to the greater good through achieving their operational objectives. Family businesses are uniquely placed to contribute to SDGs for many reasons. Firstly, because family business models have longer time perspectives, and this allows the family business to link with the longer term SDG time frame – 2030. Second, family businesses often focus on aspects of business operation which do not have an immediate return on investment such as relationship building with stakeholder groups. Thirdly, family businesses tend to rate the importance of ethics higher than standard businesses and thus align well with the social dimensions of the SDGs. Lastly, family businesses have intergenerational perspectives which is a core principle of sustainability. This book provides insights into how family business operationalises SDG#5: Gender Equality. This book uses a rigorous case study approach for family businesses to detail aspects of their business which help to advance gender equality. The cases provided here are living proof that the family business that operate for the greater good actually work! Non-family businesses can take a leaf out of the family businesses portrayed in this book as they can provide different perspectives on how businesses can successfully align SDGs and business strategy. Despite many businesses having adopted environmental social governance strategies and environmental management systems, the effect of this activity has not been reflected in a healthier planet. Many ‘state of the environment’ reports indicate that planetary health is decreasing, and planetary boundaries are being crossed or are about to be crossed. Whilst the cause of this decline is not entirely the fault of business, there still needs to be a greater effort to address the decline. The challenge for family businesses is to use their unique characteristics and set ambitious programmes of work that make a meaningful contribution to achieving global goals. This book provides insights into how family businesses can achieve such a mission and how non-family businesses can be inspired to do the same. Acknowledgements The Editors would like to thank the contributors of the book for providing insights and sharing learnings from their business practice. We acknowledge that writing up cases in the format required considerable time and effort. The quality of the cases presented is testament to their efforts. The Editors would also like to thank Emerald Publishing for supporting the publication of this book and the mission for deeper sustainability through utilising the SDGs. 1Reddrop, A. (2012).

rayyan-210787584,Economic development through new age Ayurveda,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"In this period of rapid globalization, the development of interconnected organizations and interlinked businesses with the feasibility to exchange best practices and knowledge is considered indispensable for sustainable development. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were designed to achieve sustainable development in its three dimensions: economic, social, and environmental in a balanced and integrated manner.[1] The SDGs have received recognition from environmental academics for their commitment to ""achieving peace with nature,"" and focusing on how human civilizations affect the environment in line with strong sustainability.[2] SDG 8 calls for ""sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment, and decent work for all"" covering a range of areas, including diversification, technological upgrading and innovation, promotion of decent work, entrepreneurship, growth of micro-small and medium-sized enterprises, financial inclusion, global strategies and cooperation to aid for trade, and youth employment.[1] Sustained and inclusive economic growth is essential for prosperity which can only be possible if steps will be taken in direction of building dynamic, sustainable, innovative, and people-centered economies, promoting youth employment, strengthening the productive capacities of the countries in all sectors, and adopting policies to increase productive employment. This further calls for the involvement of nonpublic, more especially private firms, and strengthens the role of a multifaceted entrepreneurship approach to include business operations in the roadmap to sustainability. AYURVEDA FOR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT Ayurveda, the oldest health-care system, has gained wide recognition and popularity globally. Ayurveda adopted the management approach which goes beyond just being a curative system of medicine to being a preventive and promotive health-care system. Ayurveda has a significant edge over contemporary medicines and it has emerged as a huge entrepreneurial opportunity for the economic development of the nation. Ayurveda has a significant global presence with its product market in India worth Rs. 515.5 billion (US$ 6.6 billion) in 2021 and is projected to record 19.8% growth from 2022 to 2027.[3] The pandemic of COVID-19 has adversely impacted the business sector and economy of the nation. However, the era of the pandemic has witnessed a boost in the Ayurveda sector. With growing concern about the need for good health and strong immune systems, the demand for herbal food products, nutritional food supplements, and immunity boosters has grown tremendously across the globe. With the changed perspective of health from curative medicine to proactive and preventive health care, consumers are focusing more on adopting various means of maintaining long-term health with health and wellness coming into the spotlight. There is an increased demand for all-natural alternatives, which are helping to grow the global market for herbal medicines. With an acceleration in the rising incidence and prevalence of long-term ailments such as diabetes mellitus, rheumatic disorders, heart diseases, stroke, and other noncommunicable diseases, the growing geriatric population, mounting health concerns over side effects of modern medicine has led to wider adoption of Ayurveda-based health-care products, Ayurvedic nutraceuticals, Ayurvedic medicines, and dietary supplements. A significant notable shift in the nutritional choices of the urban population toward healthier herbal-oriented eating choices, and growing preferences for traditional foods have led to an increase in more innovative ways to meet consumer demands. This has inflated the significant proportion of Ayurveda-based products such as ready-to-drink juices, confectionary products, and Ayurveda/healthy ready-to-eat food ranges in the food and beverages segment of the fast-moving consumer goods sector. The ease of accessibility, price, and growing awareness of the benefits of Ayurvedic food products and medicines has fueled the market expansion. ROLE OF MICRO, SMALL, AND MEDIUM ENTERPRISES IN THE INDIAN ECONOMY India is considered one of the biggest economies in the world. Indian Gross Domestic Product (GDP) has risen from Rs 2.7 lakh crore at the time of independence to now close to Rs 150 lakh crore, making it the fifth-largest economy in the world at present.[4] The nation has faced the economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic which resulted in GDP growth recovering to 6.2% in 2020 and 6.4% in 2021 after dipping to 5.8% in 2019.[5] The Indian Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) sector is one of the major contributors to the GDP of the country. In the document ""Economic Survey 2021–2022"" released by the Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance, it has been stated that the relative importance of MSMEs can be gauged from the fact that the share of MSME GVA in total GVA (current prices) for 2019–2020 and 2020–2021 was 30.50% and 26.83%, respectively.[6] The contribution of MSMEs to the economy consists of 90% of enterprises, 80% of the nonagriculture labor force, 6.11% of GDP manufacturing, 24% of GDP service sector, 33.4% in manufacturing activities, and 45% in total export.[7] Further, as per the information received from the Directorate General of Commercial Intelligence and Statistics, the share of export of specified MSME-related products to all India exports during 2021–2022 and 2022–2023 (up to August 2022) was 45.03% and 42.67%, respectively. Furthermore, the total number of persons employed in MSMEs in the year 2021–2022 and 2022–2023 (up to August 2022) is 13,019,919 and 8,423,452, respectively.[8] MSMEs play an important role in the wider ecosystem of firms where startups and young firms are considered the primary source of net job creation and are the driving force of innovation and sustainability in the private sector.[6] The MSMEs in India are playing a crucial role by providing large employment opportunities and it has been creating 11.10 crore jobs (360.41 lakhs in manufacturing, 0.07 lakh in noncaptive electricity generation and transmission, 387.18 lakhs in trade, and 362.82 lakhs in other services) in the rural and the urban areas across the country, thereby assuring a more equitable distribution of national income and wealth.[9] MICRO, SMALL, AND MEDIUM ENTERPRISES AND AYURVEDA SECTOR – PROSPECTIVE AND OPPORTUNITIES The Ayurveda industry is dominated by MSMEs accounting for more than 80% of the enterprises. Addressing the Nation at the 9th World Ayurveda Congress at Panjim, Goa, the Hon'ble Prime Minister of the Nation, Narendra Modi claimed that about 40,000 MSMEs are active in the Ayush sector emphasizing the huge scope for Ayush startups and opportunities budding in the field of Ayurveda such as the farming of herbs, manufacturing and supply of Ayush medicines, and digital services.[10] It has been observed that small businesses are frequently the impetus behind innovations that are crucial for economic growth because they have the flexibility to work outside of the dominant paradigms and take advantage of technological or commercial opportunities to make knowledge that would otherwise go untapped commercially viable. A varied range of Ayurvedic cosmetics and toiletries are produced by MSMEs in the country, in addition to the other major industry giants in the Ayurveda industry. The key challenge for MSMEs in the Ayurveda sector is to identify and connect to appropriate knowledge partners and networks at the local, national, and global levels, and develop appropriate skills and management practices for integrating knowledge created by external partners with in-house practices and innovation processes.[11] Supporting MSMEs in the Ayurveda sector requires development and imbibing the attitude of the utilization of new technologies and business fields for integration. It certainly demands capacity building, knowledge and technology transfer, financial resources, and an enabling policy framework conducive to promoting the ease of doing business. The Government of India has launched a Scheme of Funds for the Regeneration of Traditional Industries (SFURTI). The Government of India has launched cluster-based SFURTI with an aim to recognize the talent, creativity, and enterprises of hard work of rural artisans from varied sectors ranging from food products to Ayurvedic medicines, to build up innovated and traditional skills, improved technologies, advanced processes, market intelligence subsequently empower, and converting them as self-governing entrepreneurs.[12] MSMEs offer employment and entrepreneurship opportunities for young people. There is a need for the development of the ""entrepreneurial ecosystem"" in the Ayurveda sector with a focus on certain aspects such as policy, finance, culture, business development supports, human capital, and markets. The Ministry of Ayush (MoA) has launched an ""AYUSH Entrepreneurship Development Program"" in collaboration with the Ministry of MSMEs for promoting the Ayush sector in the country under different schemes. The objectives were to strengthen the Ayush sector, create more enterprises, and job creation to support the nation's economy. Various other initiatives such as Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana and cluster development introduced by different government agencies to promote entrepreneurship applicable to Ayurveda. Another Scheme for the Development of Ayush Clusters by MoA is aimed to fill the gaps in the sector related to standardization, quality assurance, control, productivity, marketing, infrastructure, and capacity building through a cluster-based approach which would be implemented on support from MoA through the way of grant to the Special Purpose Vehicle, formed by a group of entrepreneurs from Ayush sector.[12] This cluster-based approach is increasingly being recognized as an effective and sustainable strategy for the competitiveness enhancement of MSMEs which leverages the geographical proximity of the enterprises on the ""collaborating while competing"" principle providing critical mass for customization of interventions.[13] MoA has signed a memorandum of understanding with the Ministry of MSME for the promotion of Ayush enterprises and has conducted various activities such as awareness programs on the digital advertisement, e-marketing, GST and GeM, and seminar/workshop on packaging and marketing, and Export Promotion of Ayush Products.[14] On a similar ground, Academia-industry Research Incubation for Value-chain Up-gradation has also been setup by the Central Council of Research in Siddha to promote innovation, entrepreneurship by translating novel ideas into products, processes, and services for commercial exploitation, and various collaborative efforts with other scientific organizations such as Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) and Indian Council of Agricultural Research were also taken to promote research, innovation, and management.[14] The MoA and Food Safety and Standards Authority of India under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, has formulated regulations of safety and quality standards for Ayurveda food products under the ""Ayurveda Aahara"" category.[15] Since the generation of millennials is prioritizing healthy eating, the introduction of this newer food category not only ensures the production of high-quality Ayurvedic food products and aids in the expansion of the international market for Made-in-India products but will also foster the entrepreneurship culture in Ayurveda food sector. This new regulation will certainly reinforce India's global position in the entrepreneur market as a custodian of the Ayush system. At its 75th session on March 5, 2021, the United Nations General Assembly named 2023 the ""International Year of Millets,"" as an opportunity to raise awareness and direct policy attention toward harnessing the nutritional and health benefits of millet consumption as well as highlighting the benefits of creating a sustainable market for millets.[16] There are many healthy and wholesome meal preparations indicated in Ayurvedic Classics that can broaden the scope for suitable use of millet. This has encouraged the food industry to widen its horizons and a whole new era of ""Millet entrepreneurship in Ayurveda"" will emerge. Advances in information technology (IT) have the potential to help diverse stakeholders in the Ayush sector to achieve better health outcomes. Artificial intelligence-based solutions in Ayurveda diagnostics, bio-sensors and trackers are a few of the innovations to enhance Ayush health-care systems by empowering the Ayush health professionals and Ayush industries to achieve the vision of health for all. A whole new segment of opportunities in the digital-health market encircling the Ayush system has emerged in the recent past to realize the untapped potential of Ayurveda with the appropriate integration of technology and a professional approach. The All India Institute of Ayurveda (AIIA) has set up an incubation center, i.e. AIIA Incubation Centre for Innovation and Entrepreneurship (AIIA-iCAINE) to foster entrepreneurship by leveraging a network of cutting-edge businesses in Ayush. The incubation center supports entrepreneurs through capacity building, and mentoring and welcomes Innovators and entrepreneurs to seek guidance and opportunities through AIIA-iCAINE outreach programs. AIIA-iCAINE has also supported start-ups at the India International Trade Fair at Pragati Maidan selected under the categories - Food Innovations and Cosmetics; Ayur-bio-instrumentation; and IT-Innovations in Ayush Sector. AIIA has also been recognized as the Host Institute under the Ministry of MSME to identify and provide opportunities to innovators while nurturing and developing their ideas to produce market-ready and commercially viable products. TACKLING THE CHALLENGES - PROBABLE SOLUTIONS The formalization and growth of Ayurveda entrepreneurship require overcoming a number of obstacles, including insufficient R and D, a slow rate of technological upgradation, and lack of targeted marketing and branding, and inadequate focus on human resource development. These obstacles call for the creation of more enabling policy and regulatory frameworks as well as increased access to the high-quality infrastructure needed for successful operations. There should be appropriate business strategies backed by very strong research and development support to conceptualize new ventures in Ayurveda. There is a dire need to introduce various ""Apprenticeship"" and entrepreneur programs for young and enthusiastic fellows who want to invest and work in the field. It is essential to recognize the close relationship between programs that foster entrepreneurship and employment. Recognizing the contextual aspects and challenges encountered within this entrepreneurial ecosystem in Ayurveda is crucial for becoming more inclusive and meeting the needs of all young people and stakeholders of the sector. The SDGs encourage efficient usage of resources and increased industrial process adoption which is sustainable for the environment and economy. With the rise in business opportunities in the Ayurveda sector due to expanding demands for Ayush-based products, especially in personal care and food products segments, and an increase in the demand for customized products; the role of MSMEs is well-positioned to reproduce and commercialize the recent expansion in Ayurveda sector.","",https://doi.org/10.4103/ijar.ijar_10_23,"",,

However, decision-making often favours specific NBS designs, leading to uneven benefits distribution. Whereas human-centric NBS design relies on convenience, financial sustainability, historical aspects, and amenity increase through NBS technical solutions, flora- and fauna-centric (or eco-centric) design targets spatial connectedness of blue-green spaces, increase in species richness, and habitat within urban centres. Both approaches can shape the urban biodiversity landscape, yet; they often clash around planning priorities. Recent advances in AI offer potential for AI-centric urban planning, though its role remains unclear. This study examines the interplay between biodiversity and NBS planning across human-, eco-, and AI-centric domains, aiming for balanced urban outcomes. We blended narrative, integrative, and systematic literature review and propose future steps for more balanced NBS development. The findings of this work suggest that AI presents an opportunity for a more balanced NBS design through its applications in climate change prediction, water management, and project visualisation. Incorporating AI into urban planning tools can expedite modelling process, improve stakeholder communication, and enhance project outcomes visualisation. By integrating human, eco, and AI-centric approaches, urban planners can foster resilience and sustainability in NBS implementation, ensuring equitable distribution of benefits across urban landscapes.","",https://doi.org/10.1007/s11252-024-01558-6,"",,

To identify urban LUCC and the effects of its inherent climatic, geographical, and socioeconomic drivers, this study developed a hybrid method for predicting future land type area based on a Markov chain model and simulating the spatial distribution of land use based on an artificial neural network, the cellular automata approach, and the Land Expansion Analysis Strategy. The proposed method was shown effective in the following aspects: (1) identification of land use variation, (2) simulation of future land use change distribution, and (3) analysis of the contribution of different driving factors to LUCC. The approach was applied to the city of Dongguan. The land use patterns changed in a balanced manner, according to the movement distances of gravity center during 2010–2020. Compared with the land use pattern in 2020, the area of ecological land was projected to diminish by 0.67 %, 1.42 %, and 2.07 % in 2025, 2030, and 2035, respectively. Based on the simulation and prediction of the land-use areas in Dongguan, the area of woodland would reduce by 7.42 %, and the growth rate of building land would be slow.

However, human activities and climate change have significantly degraded the wetland ecosystem in recent decades in the YRD. Therefore, an understanding of the land use modifications is essential for the efficient management and preservation of ecosystems in this region. This study utilized time series of remote sensing data and the extreme gradient boosting method to generate land use maps of the YRD from 2000 to 2020. Several methods, including transition matrix, land use dynamic degree, and standard deviation ellipse, were employed to explore the characteristics of land use transitions. The results underscore significant spatial variations in land use over the past two decades. The most rapid increase was observed in built-up area, followed by terrestrial water and tidal flats, while unutilized land experienced the fastest decrease, followed by forest–grassland. The spatial distribution patterns of agricultural land, built-up area, terrestrial water, and forest–grassland demonstrated stronger directionality compared to other land use types. The wetlands have expanded in size and improved in structure. Unutilized land has been converted into artificial wetlands comprising ponds, reservoirs, salt ponds, shrimp and crab ponds, and natural wetlands featuring mudflats and forest–grassland. The wetland conservation efforts after 2008 have proven very effective, playing a positive role in ecological and environmental preservation, as well as in regional sustainable development.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/rs16111946,"",,

To improve LULCC prediction, this study proposes the use of a random forest regression (RFR) model, in comparison with logistic regression–cellular automata (LR-CA) and artificial neural network–cellular automata (ANN-CA), for the prediction of LULCC (2019–2030) in the Gaborone dam catchment (Botswana). RFR is proposed as it is able to capture the existing and potential interactions between the LULC intensity and their nonlinear interactions with the change-driving factors. For LULCC forecasting, the driving factors comprised physiographic variables (elevation, slope and aspect) and proximity-neighborhood factors (distances to water bodies, roads and urban areas). In simulating the historical LULC (1986–2019) at 5-year time steps, RFR outperformed ANN-CA and LR-CA models with respective percentage accuracies of 84.9%, 62.1% and 60.7%. Using the RFR model, the predicted LULCCs were determined as vegetation (−8.9%), bare soil (+8.9%), built-up (+2.49%) and cropland (−2.8%), with water bodies exhibiting insignificant change. The correlation between land use (built-up areas) and water depicted an increasing population against decreasing dam water capacity. The study approach has the potential for deriving the catchment land–water nexus, which can aid in the formulation of sustainable catchment monitoring and development strategies.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/su16041699,"",,

Regrettably, a substantial 64% –71% of wetlands have been lost worldwide since 1900, mainly due to changes in land use and land cover (LULC). This issue is not unique to Zambia's Bangweulu Wetland System (BWS), which faces similar challenges. However, there is limited information about the LULC changes in BWS. Furthermore, finding accurate and cost-effective methods to understand LULC dynamics is complicated by the multitude of available techniques for LULC classification. Non-parametric methods like Machine Learning (ML) offer greater accuracy, but different ML models come with distinct strengths and weaknesses. Combining multiple models has the potential to create a more precise LULC classification model. Open-source software like QGIS and spatial data like Landsat also play a significant role in this endeavour. The primary objective of this study was to enhance the accuracy of modeling LULC changes in wetland areas. Six ML models: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naive Bayes (NB), Decision Tree (DT), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Random Forest (RF), and K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) were used for LULC image classification of Landsat 8 (2020 image) and Landsat 5 (1990, 2000, and 2010 images) in QGIS. Four models: SVM, NB, DT, and KNN, performed better than the other models. Consequently, The Quad (4) hybrid model was created by fusing the maps from these four models with the highest performance. Results revealed that the fusion of the four classified maps of the SVM, NB, DT, and KNN (Quad hybrid model) showcased superior performance compared to the individual models with Kappa Index scores of 0.87, 0.72, 0.84 and 0.87 for the years 1990, 2000, 2010 and 2020, respectively. The analysis of the LULC changes from 1990 to 2020 showed a yearly decline of -1.17%, -1.01%, and -0.12% in forest, grassland, and water body coverage, respectively. In contrast, built-up areas and cropland increased at rates of 1.70% and 2.70%, respectively. This study underscores the consistent growth of cropland and built-up areas from 1990 to 2020, alongside the reduction of forest cover and grassland. Although the water body experienced a gradual decrease over this period, the decline was minimal. Long-term monitoring will be essential for evaluating the success of interventions, guiding conservation efforts, mitigating negative impacts on the wetland ecosystem, and determining whether the reduction in water bodies is a sustained trend or a short-term phenomenon.","",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envc.2024.100866,"",,

This study explores how artificial intelligence can contribute to environmental management, especially the prediction and analysis of ambient air quality through the random forest algorithm. The study aims to assess and predict the changes of ambient air quality in Chinese cities and provide a scientific basis for environmental governance. Methodologically, a random forest model was used to analyze the relationship between ambient air quality and multiple factors. The results showed that the random forest model was effective in predicting air quality, in which the level of urban economic development showed a significant correlation with air quality, and the PM2.5 concentration in cities with a high level of economic development was significantly higher than that in the towns with a low to medium level of economic growth, as the PM2.5 concentration decreased from 43.854 μg/m 3 to 33.941 μg/m 3 . In addition, seasonal variations had a significant effect on air quality. It is concluded that the random forest model is an effective tool to provide accurate data support for environmental rule of law and governance, which helps to formulate more accurate ecological protection policies.","",https://doi.org/10.2478/amns-2024-0522,"",,

Resistance to pests, diseases, and extreme weather events are among the most critical characteristics of resilient cities, closely related to species richness and, consequently, to the diversity of street trees. However, urban forest inventories are currently scarce worldwide. For this reason, urban trees' biodiversity and capacity to provide these ecosystem services are not developed enough. Three state-of-the-art species identification applications were tested, Plant.id, Pl@ntNet and Seek (iNaturalist) to identify a large number of tree families, genera, and species automatically. Two individual Google Street View images were queried for each tree in the study area, adjusting the Field of View and pitch parameters. The predictive capacity of the three apps was compared, and a biodiversity analysis was performed for different geospatial scales within the study area (i.e., at the whole study area, neighborhood, and street levels, respectively). Notably, our research contributes in an innovative way to the assessment and monitoring of the ecosystem services provided by street trees and sheds light on the great potential of combining remote sensing, citizen science and artificial intelligence for urban forest biodiversity assessments at multiple spatial and temporal scales.","",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jag.2024.103735,"",,
rayyan-210787972,Protecting ancient water harvesting technologies in India: strategies for climate adaptation and sustainable development with global lessons,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Introduction Ancient water harvesting systems, such as those from the Indus Valley Civilization (~3500 BCE), have been vital for irrigation and climate resilience, especially in arid regions. One such prominent system in South Asia, called tank irrigation, initially thrived through community management but declined post-independence due to colonial policies and neglect in Sri Lanka and India. This study evaluates current policy frameworks and rehabilitation programs to enhance the resilience of these systems in India, develop strategies for their protection and adaptation to climate change, and integrate global lessons for sustainable development. Methods A systematic meta-analysis of grey literature was conducted to aggregate data on policy constraints. Policy analysis involved detailed investigations of relevant documents, regulations, and comparative analyses of frameworks at regional and national levels. Pilot projects on tank rehabilitation were assessed through reported case studies and field surveys to gauge impact. Thematic analysis was used to explore the global potential of these systems in climate resilience and overall environmental sustainability. Results The analysis showed that pilot projects for tank rehabilitation had limited success in achieving sustainability under current climate conditions. Tank irrigation systems are crucial for adapting to extreme weather, including floods, droughts, and heat waves, replenishing groundwater, reducing soil erosion, and ensuring reliable water supplies. Traditional water harvesting technologies support 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), including clean water access, hunger reduction, gender equality, and climate action. Integrating AI and machine learning in water management benefits disaster response, while eco-tourism aids system maintenance and cultural awareness. Discussion The study underscores the need for policy reforms to enhance tank rehabilitation and institutional arrangements. It calls for increased beneficiary participation and constitutional recognition of current practices. Strategic, national-scale assessments and resilience targets are recommended to improve the effectiveness of such water harvesting systems in mitigating natural hazards and enhancing environmental services.","",https://doi.org/10.3389/frwa.2024.1441365,"",,

These impacts can be comprehended by estimating land surface temperature (LST), as it is vital for evaluating urban climate, particularly to explain the intensity of urban heat islands and to define the health and welfare of the planet as well as the living beings. Urbanization-driven landscape changes severely disrupt comfortable living in almost every city, necessitating monitoring and modelling historical, current, and likely future LSTs. This research article proposes two forecasting techniques: Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models. These models have been widely accepted for the efficient prediction of climatic parameters, including LST, over an urban area. The landscape, elevation, and LST trend served as input to the models for an accurate prediction of LST. The analysis was performed over the Kolkata Metropolitan Area (KMA) with an additional 10 km buffer to understand urban growth and its effect on the LST of the entire region. The two developed models (MLR and ANN) effectively anticipated the LST over the KMA region. A continual increment in the surface temperatures ranging from 1 °C to 4 °C, over existing and likely-predicted urban areas was comprehended. It was anticipated that the regions near the urban areas will also experience severe discomfort and heat waves without proper mitigation measures. This scientific literature provides essential insights for decision-makers, stakeholders, and government officials to articulate new policies and modify the existing ones to create a sustainable and livable urban environment for the inhabitants.","",https://doi.org/10.1080/10106049.2023.2299145,"",,

Prior studies linked thermal anomalies to urban morphology evolution and land use change during urbanization based on multi-indicator quantification of urban morphology and linear regression modeling. However, it remained unclear which urban morphology elements predominantly dominate thermal anomalies and whether their impact is solely linear, and understanding on the diverse mechanisms through how urban morphology influences various thermal anomalies across seasons remains limited. Therefore, this study employed convolutional neural networks and interpretable machine learning (Grad-CAM and SHAP) to explore nonlinear relationships between urban morphology and thermal anomalies, focusing on comparisons between different types of anomaly events across time. The main findings indicated: (1) Grad-CAM's identification of pivotal hotspot pixels and SHAP's interpretability assessment highlighted that crucial urban morphology factors contributing to thermal anomalies include the area of green spaces, water spaces, the number of residential facilities, building floor area ratio, and the count of industrial production facilities. (2) Clear nonlinear relationships were observed between dominant urban morphology factors and the occurrence of thermal anomalies, which confirming the existence of multiple thresholds and activation levels, as demonstrated through SHAP's partial dependency analysis. The dynamic complexity of these associations significantly varied depending on the type of event and the timing of thermal anomalies. These findings offer actionable guidance for urban planners to refine climate-friendly strategies, revealing the heterogeneity of these relationships across time and seasons through multi-scenario analysis and providing tailored insights for climate-sensitive urban planning.","",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2024.112024,"",,

It perceives and gathers environmental, sociological, and transitional data on its own, from a distance, in increasing amounts of spatial and temporal details. While urbanization has been continued to be a worldwide phenomenon, the urban management and planning are needed to satisfy the needs of the Earth system. The operations associated with land management, urban planning, and transportation on Earth have been connected to digital maps and geographic databases. Knowledge of land cover is also significant for managing, conserving, and formulating environmental and urban development policies. Therefore, highly accurate Land Use Land Cover (LULC) assessment and monitoring are of the utmost significance for empirical studies and organizational accomplishment.

The present study is highly essential for examining the urban expansion in a vertical hill city and the historical influence of settlement patterns along the edges of hill ranges for proper land use planning. The automatic classification of support vector machines (SVM) in-built at Orfeo tool box (OTB) modules was employed for LULC pattern classification. The land cover change method of the semi-automatic classification plugin (SCP) was used to identify the past LULC using Landsat 4, 5, 7, and 8.

Using a multidisciplinary approach, a novel remote sensing-based urban ecological condition index (RSUSEI) will be developed and applied to assess the ecological status of urban surfaces. Therefore, the identification and quantification of urbanisation is important. To do so, we used hyper-tuned artificial neural network (ANN) as well as Land Cover Change Rate (LCCR), Land Cover Index (LCI) and Landscape Expansion Index (LEI). For the development of (RSUSEI), we have used four advanced models such as fuzzy Logic, Principle Component Analysis (PCA), Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) and fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process (FAHP) to integrate various ecological parameters. In order to obtain more information for better decision making in urban planning, sensitivity and uncertainty analyses based on a deep neural network (DNN) were also used. The results of the study show a multi-layered pattern of urbanisation in Saudi Arabian cities reflected in the LCCR, indicating rapid urban expansion, especially in the built-up areas with an LCCR of 0.112 over the 30-year period, corresponding to a more than four-fold increase in urban land cover. At the same time, the LCI shows a remarkable increase in 'built-up' areas from 3.217% to 13.982%, reflecting the substantial conversion of other land cover types to urban uses. Furthermore, the LEI emphasises the complexity of urban growth. Outward expansion (118.98 km2), Edge-Expansion (95.22 km2) and Infilling (5.00 km2) together paint a picture of a city expanding outwards while filling gaps in the existing urban fabric. The RSUSEI model shows that the zone of extremely poor ecological condition covers an area of 157–250 km2, while the natural zone covers 91–410 km2. The DNN based sensitivity analysis is useful to determine the optimal model, while the integrated models have lower input parameter uncertainty than other models.

To assess disparities in heat vulnerability and its environmental justice implications, we model supply-demand mismatches for the ecosystem service (ES) urban temperature regulation. We integrated remote sensing, health, and socio-demographic data with Artificial Intelligence for Environment and Sustainability (ARIES) and geographical information system tools. We computed composite indicators at the census tract level for urban cooling supply, and vulnerability to heat as a measure of demand. We do so in the context of the mid-size city of Vitoria-Gasteiz, Basque Country (Europe). We mapped relative mismatches after identifying and analysed their relationship with socio-demographic and health factors. Our findings show disparities in heat vulnerability, with increased exposure observed among socio-economically disadvantaged communities, the elderly, and people with health issues. Areas associated with higher income levels show lower ES mismatches, indicating higher temperature regulation supply and reduced heat vulnerability. The results point at the need for nature-based heat mitigation interventions that especially focus on the more socio-economically disadvantaged communities.","",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.171215,"",,

This study aimed to identify suitable sites for eco-friendly and safe building complexes amidst complex geophysical, geoecological, and socio-economic factors, integrating natural hazards assessment and risk management. Employing the Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (Fuzzy-AHP), the study constructed a suitability model incorporating sixteen parameters. Additionally, a Deep Neural Network (DNN) based on eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) conducted sensitivity analyses to assess the parameters’ influence on optimal location decision making. The results reveal slope as the most crucial parameter (22.90%), followed by altitude and land use/land cover (13.24%), emphasizing topography and environmental considerations. Drainage density (11.36%) and rainfall patterns (9.15%) are also significant for flood defense and water management. Only 12.21% of the study area is deemed “highly suitable”, with “no-build zones” designated for safety and environmental protection.

The idea of a sustainable AI urbanism - often understood as the juxtaposition of smart and eco urbanism - is here critiqued through a reconstruction of the conceptual sources of these two urban paradigms. Some key ideas of smart and eco urbanism are indicated as incompatible and therefore the fusion of these two paradigms is assessed as an unstable basis for shaping sustainable AI urbanism. The concepts in question - modernity, science and nature – are subsequently redefined following Latour’s philosophical perspective, in an attempt to define a different theoretical basis for a sustainable AI urbanism in the Anthropocene. Finally, the principles of a design philosophy shaped by Latour are used to change the design culture that informs AI urbanism towards a more sustainable practice. This paper constructs and promotes a dialogue between the disciplines of philosophy and urban theory with urban design in the conviction that the principles produced by the former and the practices carried out by the latter must start a biunivocal relationship. The paper reveals that in order to change design culture in the field of AI urbanism, it is necessary to rethink some of the key ideas that inform the Western and modern worldview through novel philosophical reflections.","",https://doi.org/10.1007/s10676-024-09752-y,"",,

This review explores the potential of stormwater management strategies and Artificial Intelligence modeling tools in enhancing water quality. The study focuses on evaluating stormwater modeling tools for planning and improving stormwater systems, assessing modeling efficiency, and understanding the impacts of new development on stormwater runoff and water quality. Various stormwater modeling tools are compared to aid in water management in urban and rural settings, which is crucial due to increasing storm intensity from climate change. The review debates the advantages and limitations of different modeling tools, particularly in modeling stormwater quantity and quality under different scenarios. It also examines tools used for predicting and analysing stormwater runoff during storm events in diverse locations. The assessment of modeling tools is centred on their support for Green Infrastructure (GI) practices, considering factors like modeling accuracy, data availability, and requirements. The study highlights the importance of these tools in managing water in urban areas and safeguarding water sources during stormwater events.

Changes in ecosystem services brought on by changes in land use and cover (LULC) are a crucial early indicator and warning sign of ecological shifts. Using remote sensing and GIS tools, this study examined the shifting dynamics of ESVs in the Haridwar district in Uttarakhand state, India. The evaluation of land use land cover (LULC) changes was carried out by analyzing satellite images of the research region from 2001 to 2021. In addition, we examined changes in ecosystem services according to the study area’s LULC classifications. Using a random forest machine learning classifier, satellite images were classified into five categories of land cover: water bodies, forests, built-up areas, agricultural land, and bare land. The findings showed that from 2001 to 2021, forest cover and water bodies fell by 15.35% and 41.50%, respectively, while urban area and agricultural area rose by 69.24% and 12.31%, respectively. Due to increased urbanization and degradation of water bodies and forest areas, ESV fell from 103.19 USD ha −1 year −1 in 2001 to 70.53 USD ha −1 year −1 in 2021. The combination of LULC with the value of ecosystem services may improve our knowledge of several difficulties in an urban ecosystem. As a result, we advocate for the incorporation of LULC and ESVs as a tool that might be useful to urban planners and land managers in the future for sustainable development of natural resources.","",https://doi.org/10.1088/2631-8695/ad5c2c,"",,
rayyan-210788531,Hyper‐Local Temperature Prediction Using Detailed Urban Climate Informatics,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract The accurate modeling of urban microclimate is a challenging task given the high surface heterogeneity of urban land cover and the vertical structure of street morphology. Recent years have witnessed significant efforts in numerical modeling and data collection of the urban environment. Nonetheless, it is difficult for the physical‐based models to fully utilize the high‐resolution data under the constraints of computing resources. The advancement in machine learning (ML) techniques offers the computational strength to handle the massive volume of data. In this study, we proposed a modeling framework that uses ML approach to estimate point‐scale street‐level air temperature from the urban‐resolving meso‐scale climate model and a suite of hyper‐resolution urban geospatial data sets, including three‐dimensional urban morphology, parcel‐level land use inventory, and weather observations from a sensor network. We implemented this approach in the City of Chicago as a case study to demonstrate the capability of the framework. The proposed approach vastly improves the resolution of temperature predictions in cities, which will help the city with walkability, drivability, and heat‐related behavioral studies. Moreover, we tested the model's reliability on out‐of‐sample locations to investigate the modeling uncertainties and the application potentials to the other areas. This study aims to gain insights into next‐gen urban climate modeling and guide the observation efforts in cities to build the strength for the holistic understanding of urban microclimate dynamics.","",https://doi.org/10.1029/2023ms003943,"",,

By applying integrated models of ANN-CA Markov, GeoDetector, and InVEST model, this study aimed to analyze LULC change, their driving factors, and implications on carbon storage in the Forest Management Unit (FMU) of Ampang Plampang in West Nusa Tenggara, Indonesia. Several data sources were utilized in the modelling approach, including DEM (Digital Elevation Model), topographical map, Landsat imageries (2011, 2016, 2021), measured carbon density (above ground, below ground, soil, dead organic), and socio-economic data (number of populations, farmer, and agricultural land). The dryland forest in the study area constitutes the most extensive LULC that has experienced significant declines due to deforestation, predominantly transforming into agricultural land, and these are predicted to continue until 2031 with different magnitudes. The significant driving factors of LULC change were elevation, population pressure on land, and distance from settlement. The LULC change also greatly influenced the decline of carbon storage historically (2011–2016) and in projected LULC (2026–2031). The conversion of forested areas to non-forest LULCs has released carbon emissions of about 1.89 Mt CO2-eq. The study findings implied that the integration of ANN-CA Markov, GeoDetector, and InVEST models has been helpful for comprehending complicated interactions among LULC change, driving factors, and carbon dynamics. The results also contribute to the scientific knowledge base for land management decision-making and policy formulation. Effective management of LULC changes through low carbon development is suggested to mitigate the loss of carbon storage capacities, foster sustainable development goals (SDGs), support Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC), and improve ecosystem resilience.","",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejrs.2024.08.002,"",,

The advancement of deep neural networks has significantly improved forecasting performance. However, a notable challenge lies in the ability of these models to generalize well to out-of-distribution (OOD) time series data. The inherent spatial heterogeneity and domain shifts across urban environments create hurdles that prevent models from adapting and performing effectively in new urban environments. To tackle this problem, we propose a solution to derive invariant representations for more robust predictions under different urban environments instead of relying on spurious correlation across urban environments for better generalizability. Through extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world data, we demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms traditional time series forecasting models when tackling domain shifts in changing urban environments.

rayyan-210788749,Empowering urban climate resilience and adaptation: Crowdsourcing weather citizen stations-enhanced temperature prediction,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"The growing impact of climate change, including extreme weather events, represents a significant challenge for humanity. With most of the world's population living in urban areas, the urban heat island effect and anthropogenic heat contribute to elevated city temperatures. This increase in urban warming threatens human health and demands a deeper understanding of thermal distribution in urban environments. Collecting accessible and widespread temperature data in urban areas is essential to address this challenge. This study aims to develop a methodology for anticipating temperature distribution in urban environments, leveraging Citizen Weather Stations (CWS) as valuable crowdsourcing data sources. The ultimate goal is to create a predictive model that estimates urban temperatures based on government meteorological station forecasts, improving urban planning, regulating temperature-based routes, preventing health issues in vulnerable populations, and enhancing urban livability. The methodology is divided into three fundamental stages: data acquisition through CWS with citizen collaboration, the development and evaluation of optimal forecast models based on government weather stations (SWS) data, and its exploitation in terms of utility and applicability. This methodology encompasses data collection and filtering to ensure its usefulness and implement reliable models. The resulting tool facilitates informed decision-making and precise seasonal event planning in urban environments, effectively addressing the challenges of climate extrapolation and contributing to more effective adaptation and mitigation strategies in climate change and heatwaves. The results obtained probe the feasibility of using CWS to predict temperatures in urban environments, which has been demonstrated accurately. This is a significant achievement, as CWS has proven to be a reliable source of climate data for this context. Also, the filtering process described and applied to the case study has proven effective, discarding approximately 34.87% of the data. This is achieved by detecting and eliminating anomalies, considering station availability, and adhering to specific quality criteria. Finally, the developed prediction model has demonstrated its ability to optimally estimate urban temperatures, utilizing climate prediction data provided by government weather stations (SWS). The model performance indicators support this claim. For the linear regression model, a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 2.177 and an R-squared (R2) of 0.960 are obtained, while for the neural network, an MSE of 1.284 and an R2 of 0.976 are achieved.","",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scs.2024.105208,"",,

The LULC classification was divided into seven classes using random forest classification, and Landsat-5(TM) and 9(OLI-2) satellite data were used. Saga GIS has been utilized for the detection of LULC change during the 1991-2022 period. For validation of classification results, accuracy assessment was estimated using error matrices and through user, producer, and overall accuracy estimation. The Kappa statistics were applied for the reliability of the accuracy assessment result. As a result, the built-up area increased by 507.8 percent, and other classes like agricultural, barren, fallow land, and vegetation cover rapidly declined and altered into concrete areas over the period.

Using construction land data from four phases, spanning 1990 to 2020, in Mianning County, this study employs methodologies like the Landscape Expansion Index (LEI) and land use transfer matrix to delineate the spatiotemporal evolution characteristics of construction land. A comprehensive set of 12 influencing factors across five categories—geomorphology, geological activity, climate, river and vegetation environment, and social economy—were examined. The Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) model was then employed to decipher the spatial distribution pattern of construction land in 1990 and 2020, shedding light on the driving mechanisms behind its changes over the three decades. The research reveals distinct patterns of construction land distribution and evolution in Mianning County, shaped by the ecological and geological landscape. Notably, the Anning River wide valley exhibits a concentrated and contiguous development mode, while the Yalong River deep valley showcases a decentralized development pattern, and the Dadu River basin manifests an aggregation development mode centered around high mountain lakes. Over the study period, all three river basins witnessed varying degrees of construction land expansion, transitioning from quantitative expansion to qualitative enhancement. Edge expansion predominantly characterizes the expansion mode, complemented by leapfrog and infilling modes, accompanied by conversions from cropland and forest land to construction land. An analysis of the spatial pattern and drivers of construction land change highlights human-induced factors dominating the Anning River Basin, contrasting with natural factors prevailing in the Yalong River Basin and the Dadu River Basin. Future efforts should prioritize climate change considerations and environmental capacity, aiming for an ecologically resilient spatial pattern of construction land.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/land13070993,"",,

Understanding urban vertical structures, particularly building heights, is essential for examining the intricate interaction between humans and their environment. Such datasets are indispensable for a variety of applications, including climate modeling, energy consumption analysis, and socioeconomic activities. Despite the importance of this information, previous studies have primarily focused on estimating building heights regionally on a grid scale, often resulting in datasets with limited coverage or spatial resolution. This limitation hampers comprehensive global analyses and the ability to generate actionable insights on finer scales. In this study, we developed a global building height map (3D-GloBFP) at a building footprint scale by leveraging Earth Observation (EO) datasets and advanced machine learning techniques. Our approach integrated multisource remote sensing features and building morphology features to develop height estimation models using the eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) regression method across diverse global regions. This methodology allowed us to estimate the heights of individual buildings worldwide, culminating in the creation of the first global three-dimensional (3-D) building footprints (3D-GloBFP). Our evaluation results show that the height estimation models perform exceptionally well on a worldwide scale, with R2 ranging from 0.66 to 0.96 and root mean square errors (RMSEs) ranging from 1.9 m to 14.6 m across 33 subregions. Comparisons with other datasets demonstrate that our 3D-GloBFP closely matches the distribution and spatial pattern of reference heights. Our derived 3-D global building footprint map shows a distinct spatial pattern of building heights across regions, countries, and cities, with building heights gradually decreasing from the city center to the surrounding rural areas. Furthermore, our findings indicate the disparities in built-up infrastructure (i.e., building volume) across different countries and cities. China is the country with the most intensive total built-up infrastructure (5.28×1011 m3, accounting for 23.9 % of the global total), followed by the United States (3.90×1011 m3, accounting for 17.6 % of the global total). Shanghai has the largest volume of built-up infrastructure (2.1×1010 m3) of all representative cities. The derived building-footprint scale height map (3D-GloBFP) reveals the significant heterogeneity of urban built-up environments, providing valuable insights for studies in urban socioeconomic dynamics and climatology.

rayyan-210788880,Unlocking resilience and sustainability with earth-based materials: a principled framework for urban transformation,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"This paper introduces a transformative “living” hypothesis in architecture and engineering, proposing a paradigm shift from conventional design to regenerative, ecologically interconnected resilient systems. At the heart of our hypothesis is the integration of earth-bound materials and bioreceptive surfaces through metabolic exchanges that can be directly monitored via bioelectricity using advanced computational models and cooperative governance structures. This innovative approach that links the living world with natural materials and digital computing, aims to foster sustainable urban development that dynamically and meaningfully responds to ecological shifts, thereby enhancing social sustainability and environmental resilience. Founded on an active relationship with Earth Based Materials (EBMs) our work operationalises the foundational link between organic life and inorganic matter, e.g., minerals, to establish a dynamic relationship between building materials, and ecological systems drawing on the foundational metabolisms of microbes. To enable this ambitious synthesis, our work builds upon and diverges from traditional foundations by operationalizing actor-network theory, new materialism, and regenerative design principles through the application of bioelectrical microbes to “living” materials and digital twins. We propose a novel resilience framework that not only advocates for a symbiotic relationship between human habitats and natural ecosystems but also outlines practical pathways for the creation of adaptive, self-organizing built environments that are informed by data collection and metabolic feedback loops. These environments are fundamentally regenerative, dynamic, and environmentally responsive in ways that can be understood and engaged by human engineers and designers, transcending current sustainability and resilience targets through a methodology rooted in interdisciplinary collaboration. We address challenges such as regulatory barriers, lack of standardization, and perceptions of inferiority compared to conventional materials, proposing a new standardization framework adaptable to the unique properties of these materials. Our vision is supported by advanced predictive digital modelling techniques and sensors, including the integration of biofilms that generate action potentials, enabling the development of Digital Twins that respond to metabolic signals to enhance sustainability, biodiversity, and ultimately generate environmentally positive socio-economic outcomes. This paper reviews existing methodologies to establish an overview of state-of-the-art developments and offers a clear, actionable plan and recommendations for the realization of regenerative and resilient systems in urban development. It contributes a unique perspective on sustainable urban development, emphasizing the need for a holistic approach, which integrates the foundational metabolism of microbes, assisted by big biological data and artificial intelligences that act in concert to respect both the environment and the intricate dynamics of living systems.","",https://doi.org/10.3389/fbuil.2024.1385116,"",,
rayyan-210788939,THE ROLE AND IMPACT OF VEGETATION ON THE URBAN FABRIC. CASE OF GUELMA CITY,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"In cities, land use changes caused by various human activities can affect how natural ecosystems function. In this context, it is increasingly important for cities to consider the role of vegetation in preserving a sustainable environment. A diachronic analysis of landscape changes was applied to assess the presence and distribution of vegetation to determine whether it was evolving or regressing. This phenomenon was studied within the current administrative boundaries of the city of Guelma (Algeria). For this purpose, as an approach based on landscape metrics, several Landsat TM and ETM+ remote sensing satellite images were used throughout the period 1987-2019. A set of landscape indices, including NP, AREA_MN, LPI, PLAND, AI and LSI, were calculated to map land cover, the mechanism of land cover and vegetation change, and their impact on the urban ecosystem. The geo-statistical procedure was carried out using a geographic information system Qgis combined by statistical software using Fragstats to calculate various landscape metrics at class level for the analysis of fragmentation . The results of the landscape metric analysis show that the decrease in average area and the increase in the number of green patches are important indicators of land degradation, meaning that the mechanism of landscape degradation and transformation is progressive. This underlines the need to give particular attention to land use and land cover in the region to ensure the sustainable allocation of natural resources.","",https://doi.org/10.31435/rsglobal_ijitss/30092024/8262,"",,

It has been determined that forest fires have serious consequences for ecosystems, causing the destruction of plants and animals, deterioration of air quality and increased emissions of greenhouse gases. They also cause significant economic losses, affecting forest resources, infrastructure and tourism. Climate change and changes in environmental conditions contribute to the spread of pests in forests, which can worsen the situation in forestry and biodiversity conservation. Addressing these challenges requires an integrated approach, including scientific research, strategic planning, risk management and active public engagement. The authors provide a classification of these methods, based on the method of influence, the nature of the influence and the direction of the action. The purpose of the study is to identify and analyze effective approaches and methods aimed at reducing the risk of forest fires and controlling the spread of pests in forest ecosystems. The research uses the methods of camera analysis and review of scientific works, supplemented by field research. This made it possible to develop reasonable recommendations for reducing the risk of forest fires. Special attention was paid to the analysis of forest management data, which included information on the distribution of forests by land category, the classification of plantations and their sanitary condition. Field studies have helped to update and clarify data on the state of plantations and identify key factors that increase the risk of fires. Modern methods of detecting forest fires were used, including video surveillance cameras, satellite surveillance, patrolling territories and the use of unmanned aerial vehicles. A forest fire early detection system is described, which includes IoT devices combined in a porous topology and equipped with sensors for temperature, carbon dioxide, hydrogen, and hydrocarbon gases. The article also describes the methods of multivariate data analysis and principal component methods for reducing data dimensionality and identifying key factors affecting the occurrence of fires. Regression analysis is used to establish the relationship between various variables and predict the probability of fire occurrence. Physico-mechanical, chemical, biological and silvicultural methods of reducing the risk of forest fires and the impact of pests and diseases are identified, including manual collection of insects, shaking off caterpillars, use of traps, chemical spraying and creation of mixed and multi-aged stands. Research perspectives may include the following key aspects: exploring and integrating advanced technologies, such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, and remote sensing of the Earth, for early detection of forest fires and monitoring of pest populations; study of the impact of climate change on the frequency and intensity of forest fires and the distribution of pests, as well as the development of adaptation strategies. Presented a system for early detection of forest fires based on the use of IoT devices connected to a network with a porous topology. Various factors affecting the risk of fires were studied, and a multivariate analysis of these data was carried out. The early fire detection system is of great importance for the prevention and effective response to forest fires. Considered the use of different risk management methods, including regulatory, legal, organizational, economic and socio-psychological approaches, is critical to reducing the risk of fires. The use of combined methods that include preventive, repressive and compensatory approaches is effective in fighting fires. The use of video surveillance cameras, satellite surveillance, patrolling and unmanned aerial vehicles significantly increases the effectiveness of early detection of fires. It is emphasized that there is no universal method of fighting forest fires and pests, and a comprehensive approach is needed, which includes physical-mechanical, chemical, biological and special forestry measures. Overall, the study highlights the importance of integrated risk management strategies and the implementation of innovative technologies for forest fire risk reduction and pest control.","",https://doi.org/10.31548/dopovidi.1(107).2024.021,"",,

The political commitment to align these plans with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the 2030 Agenda reflects an effort to integrate global priorities into local agendas. Such alignment is critical for fostering sustainable and inclusive progress. However, despite its importance, research on the intersection between government plans and the SDGs remains limited. In this study, we used natural language processing (NLP), artificial intelligence, and statistical analysis to examine the government plans of ten candidates in the 2022 gubernatorial election in the Brazilian state of São Paulo. Our analysis identified key policy topics, explored patterns and trends, and assessed alignment with the 17 SDGs across the social (SDGs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, and 16), environmental (SDGs 6, 13, 14, and 15), and economic (SDGs 7, 8, 9, 11, and 12) dimensions.

During the 1970s, Brazil experienced most of its population living in cities for the first time. Historically, urbanization has been intensely related to land use and cover changes, amplifying climatic and ecological stress in recently established metropolises. This study aims to analyze, through classified Remote Sensing images and the Cellular Automata and Artificial Neural Networks (CA-ANN) machine learning model, land use and land cover trends in regions that have experienced accentuated demographic growth in the decades 2000 and 2010. The methodology consists of: i) identifying areas with a high density of buildings, ii) defining the variables that drive land use change, and iii) proposing a methodology for predicting changes in the urban area. The results indicate that the urban class prediction presented high precision (≥ 0.74) and recall (≥ 0.86) indices. Forest class also presented a high precision score (≥0.72), showing an elevated prediction hit rate.

Convolutional neural networks were employed in conjunction with satellite imagery analysis to map and quantify the changes in land use and cover. This revealed significant trends and transformations within the peninsula’s landscape. The analysis revealed a notable increase in urban expansion, particularly at the expense of natural ecosystems. Furthermore, there was a notable reversion of agricultural lands to grasslands, driven by economic downturns and reduced agricultural activity. These land cover changes underscore the urgency of implementing sustainable land management policies. The study recommends the establishment of conservation easements to protect remaining natural ecosystems, the initiation of reforestation programs to restore degraded lands, and the development of comprehensive water management strategies to address the peninsula’s hydrological challenges. Furthermore, the study underscores the pivotal importance of integrating change analysis and predictive modeling to anticipate future land cover scenarios and inform effective land management strategies. The model developed through this research, which employs advanced remote sensing and GIS technologies, provides a robust framework for understanding and managing land use and land cover change. This model can serve as a reference for similar regions globally, offering insights that can inform sustainable land use practices and policy decisions.

Due to the high spatial–temporal variations, rainfall measurement could be challenging and costly, especially in urban areas. This could be even more challenging in tropical regions with their typical short-duration and high-intensity rainfall events, as some of the undeveloped or developing countries in those regions lack a dense rain gauge network and have limited resources to use radar and satellite readings. Thus, exploring alternative rainfall estimation methods could be helpful to back up some shortcomings. Recently, a few studies have examined the utilisation of citizen science methods to collect rainfall data as a complement to the existing rain gauge networks. However, these attempts are in the early stages, and limited works have been published on improving the quality of such data. Therefore, this study focuses on image-based rainfall estimation with potential usage in citizen science. For this, a novel convolutional neural network (CNN) model is developed to predict rainfall intensity by processing the images captured by citizens (e.g., by smartphones or security cameras) in an urban area. The developed model is merely a complementary sensing tool (e.g., better spatial coverage) to the existing rain gauge network in an urban area and is not meant to replace it. This study also presents one of the most extensive datasets of rain image data ever published in the literature. The estimated rainfall data by the proposed CNN model of this study using images captured by surveillance cameras and smartphone cameras are compared with observed rainfall by a weather station and exhibit strong R2 values of 0.955 and 0.840, respectively.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/bdcc8100126,"",,

We used Artificial-neural-network-based cellular automaton (ANN-CA) model to simulate LULC in 2030 and 2050 based on LULC data from 1990 to 2020. Predicted results reveal that agricultural land, barren land, vegetation, and water bodies are likely to decline by 7.56%, 3.06%, 12.22%, and 1.77%, respectively, between 2020 and 2050, but built-up areas are expected to increase by 24.61% owing to urbanization, industrialization, and economic growth. ESV results indicate that vegetation and agriculture make up 70% of the overall ESV, making them the leading LULC groups. The overall ESV could fall by 8.95 US$ ×106/year, mostly due to a decline in agricultural land, waterbodies, and vegetation.

High-resolution urban climate modeling has faced substantial challenges due to the absence of a globally consistent, spatially continuous, and accurate dataset to represent the spatial heterogeneity of urban surfaces and their biophysical properties. This deficiency has long obstructed the development of urban-resolving Earth System Models (ESMs) and ultra-high-resolution urban climate modeling, particularly at large scales. Here, we present a first-of-its-kind 1km-resolution present-day (circa-2020) global continuous urban surface parameter dataset – U-Surf. Using the urban canopy model (UCM) in the Community Earth System Model as a base model for developing dataset requirements, U-Surf leverages the latest advances in remote sensing, machine learning, and cloud computing to provide the most relevant urban surface biophysical parameters, including radiative, morphological, and thermal properties, for UCMs at the facet- and canopy-level. Our high-resolution U-Surf dataset significantly improves the representation of the urban land heterogeneity both within and across cities globally. U-Surf provides essential, high-fidelity surface biophysical constraints to urban-resolving ESMs, enables detailed city-to-city comparisons across the globe, and supports the next-generation kilometer-resolution Earth system modeling across scales. U-Surf parameters can be easily converted or adapted to various types of UCMs, such as those embedded in weather and regional climate models, as well as air quality models. The fundamental urban surface constraints provided by U-Surf are also relevant as features for machine learning models and can have other broad-scale applications for socioeconomic, public health, and urban planning contexts. We expect U-Surf to promote the research frontier on urban systems science, climate-sensitive urban design, and coupled human-Earth systems in the future.

rayyan-210789554,Identifying Temporal Change in Urban Water Bodies Using OpenStreetMap and Landsat Imagery: A Study of Hangzhou City,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"As one of the most important ecosystems, the water body is losing water during the rapid development of the city. To understand the impacts on water body change during the rapid urbanization period, this study combines data from the OpenStreetMap platform with Landsat 5/Thematic Mapper images to effectively and accurately identify small urban water bodies. The findings indicate that the trained U-net convolutional neural network (U-Net) water body extraction model and loss function combining Focal Loss and Dice Loss adopted in this study demonstrate high precision in identifying water bodies within the main urban area of Hangzhou, with an accuracy rate of 94.3%. Trends of decrease in water areas with a continuous increase in landscape fragmentation, particularly for the plain river network, were observed from 1985 to 2010, indicating a weaker connection between water bodies resulting from rapid urbanization. Large patches of water bodies, such as natural lakes and big rivers, located at divisions at the edge of the city are susceptible to disappearing during the rapid outward expansion. However, due to the limitations and strict control of development, water bodies, referring to as wetland, slender canals, and plain river networks, in the traditional center division of the city, are preserved well. Combined with the random forest classification method and the U-Net water body extraction model, land use changes from 1985 to 2010 are calculated. Reclamation along the Qiantang River accounts for the largest conversion area between water bodies and cultivated land, constituting more than 90% of the total land use change area, followed by the conversion of water bodies into construction land, particularly in the northeast of Xixi Wetland. Notably, the conversion of various land use types within Xixi Wetland into construction land plays a significant role in the rise of the carbon footprint.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/rs16142579,"",,

Journal of Advances in Modeling Earth Systems , 16, e2023MS003943. https://doi.org/10.1029/2023MS003943 Modeling urban microclimate accurately is challenging due to the high surface heterogeneity of urban land cover and the vertical structure of street morphology. Recent years have witnessed significant efforts in numerical modeling and data collection of the urban environment. Nonetheless, it is difficult for the physical-based models to fully utilize the high-resolution data under the constraints of computing resources. The advancement in machine learning techniques offers the computational strength to handle the massive volume of data. In this study, we proposed a machine learning approach to estimate point-scale street-level air temperature from the urban-resolving mesoscale climate model and a suite of hyper-resolution urban informatics, including three-dimensional urban morphology, parcel-level land use inventory, and a dense weather observation network. We implemented this approach in the City of Chicago as a case study. The proposed approach vastly improves the resolution of temperature predictions in cities, which will help the city with walkability, drivability, and heat-related behavioral studies. Moreover, we tested the model’s reliability on out-of-sample locations to investigate the application potentials to the other areas. This study also aims to gain insights into next-gen urban climate modeling and guide city observation efforts to build the strength for the holistic understanding of urban microclimate dynamics.","",https://doi.org/10.22541/essoar.168121520.07415257/v2,"",,

Remote sensing technology, as the primary means of capturing this change, provides valuable data for research. The main research object of this paper is the four classification methods of land use in cities based on remote sensing technology, and it outlines the main roles and applications of these four classification methods. This paper concludes that the visual interpretation method is less efficient but widely used. In addition, the accuracy of supervised classification and deep learning methods for classification is low. Unsupervised classification is simple, but the results differ greatly from reality. The above commonly used land classification methods have their advantages and disadvantages, and their combined use ensures that remote sensing technology provides real-time, effective, and comprehensive land use information for urban planning and management. Finally, this paper looks forward to the combination of remote sensing technology and modern technology, such as artificial intelligence. The integrated technology can provide more accurate and efficient technical support for future urban development.","",https://doi.org/10.61173/9smr3z05,"",,
rayyan-210789662,Flood vulnerability assessment in rural and urban informal settlements: case study of Karonga District and Lilongwe City in Malawi,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract Flood vulnerability assessment (FVA) informs the disaster risk reduction and preparedness process in both rural and urban areas. However, many flood-vulnerable regions like Malawi still lack FVA supporting frameworks in all phases (pre-trans-post disaster). Partly, this is attributed to lack of the evidence-based studies to inform the processes. This study was therefore aimed at assessing households’ flood vulnerability (HFV) in rural and urban informal areas of Malawi, using case studies of Traditional Authority (T/A) Kilupula of Karonga District (KD) and Mtandire Ward in Lilongwe City (LC). A household survey was used to collect data from a sample of 545 household participants. Vulnerability was explored through a combination of underlying vulnerability factors (UVFs)-physical-social-economic-environmental and cultural with vulnerability components (VCs)-exposure-susceptibility and resilience. The UVFs and VCs were agglomerated using binomial multiple logit regression model. Variance inflation factor (VIF) was used to check the multicollinearity of variables in the regression model. HFV was determined based on the flood vulnerability index (FVI). The data were analysed using Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA), artificial neural network (ANN) and STATA. The results reveal a total average score of high vulnerability (0.62) and moderate vulnerability (0.52) on MCA in T/A Kilupula of Karonga District and Mtandire Ward of Lilongwe City respectively. The FVI revealed very high vulnerability on enviroexposure factors (EEFs) ( $$0.9$$ <mml:math xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""> <mml:mrow> <mml:mn>0.9</mml:mn> </mml:mrow> </mml:math> ) in LC and $$(0.8$$ <mml:math xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""> <mml:mrow> <mml:mo>(</mml:mo> <mml:mn>0.8</mml:mn> </mml:mrow> </mml:math> ) in KD, followed by ecoresilience factors (ERFs) (0.8) in KD and $$(0.6$$ <mml:math xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""> <mml:mrow> <mml:mo>(</mml:mo> <mml:mn>0.6</mml:mn> </mml:mrow> </mml:math> ) in LC and physioexposure factors (PEFs) ( $$0.5)$$ <mml:math xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""> <mml:mrow> <mml:mn>0.5</mml:mn> <mml:mo>)</mml:mo> </mml:mrow> </mml:math> in LC besides 0.6 in KD for the combined UVFs and VCs. The study concludes that the determinants of households’ flood vulnerability are place settlement, low-risk knowledge, communication accessibility, lack of early warning systems, and limited access to income of household heads. The study recommends that an FVA framework should be applied to strengthen the political, legal, social, and economic responsibilities of government for building the resilience of communities and supporting planning and decision-making processes in flood risk management.","",https://doi.org/10.1007/s11069-024-06601-5,"",,

This study aimed to assess LULC changes for a 30 year period (1990 – 2020) and project future LULC from 2030 to 2100 for the Irrawaddy Delta using remote sensing and simulations with the artificial neural networks-cellular automata method. The findings showed significant LULC changes in the Delta, particularly for the mangrove forests and cropland (rice paddies). Mangrove coverage was 1,471 km² in 1990 but decreased to 1,282 km² in 2020, and simulations predict a further reduction to 1,277 km² in 2100. Cropland areas increased from 10,550 km² to 10,618 km² in 2020, with simulations projecting a slight decrease to 10,586 km² by 2100. Human activities and cyclonic events, especially in the southern part of the region, have led to barren land and impervious areas replacing dense mangrove and forested areas. These changes threaten the ecological integrity of the Delta and impact local livelihoods and biodiversity. The study underscores the need for sustainable land management practices and policies to mitigate the adverse effects of LULC changes and ensure the resilience of the Irrawaddy Delta against ongoing environmental challenges.","",https://doi.org/10.20944/preprints202407.0442.v1,"",,

In Iran, particularly in Tehran, recurring flood events underscore the urgent need for robust urban resilience strategies. This paper explores flood resilience models to identify the most effective approach for District 6 in Tehran. Through an extensive literature review, various resilience models were analyzed, with the Climate Disaster Resilience Index (CDRI) emerging as the most suitable model for this district due to its comprehensive resilience dimensions: Physical, Social, Economic, Organizational, and Natural Health resilience. Although the CDRI model provides a structured approach to resilience measurement, it remains a static model focused on spatial characteristics and lacks temporal adaptability. An extensive literature review enhances the CDRI model by integrating data from 2013 to 2022 in three-year intervals and applying machine learning techniques to predict resilience dimensions for 2025. This integration enables a dynamic resilience model that can accommodate temporal changes, providing a more adaptable and data driven foundation for urban flood resilience planning. By employing artificial intelligence to reflect evolving urban conditions, this model offers valuable insights for policymakers and urban planners to enhance flood resilience in Tehrans critical District 6.","",https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2412.06205,"",,

Monitoring these changes for sustainable urban development, resource management, and disaster readiness is imperative. Satellite image Change Detection (CD) has emerged as a potent tool for comprehensively and efficiently evaluating urban changes over time. Techniques for CD facilitate identifying, characterising, and quantifying modifications in land cover, land use, and natural phenomena. This capability is pivotal for environmental monitoring, resource management, and disaster response. Detecting changes in urban expansion, deforestation, agricultural practices, and natural disasters contributes to informed decision-making and sustainable development. Whether it is gradual urban expansion or sudden infrastructural developments, the ability to detect changes offers valuable insights into the patterns and drivers of urban growth. Integrating remote sensing technologies and advanced image processing techniques has remarkably enhanced the accuracy and efficiency of CD in urban environments. These methods enable the identification of land cover changes, such as converting green spaces to built-up areas or adjusting transportation networks. This paper introduces an effective CD model that incorporates a deep learning approach. The proposed architecture is directly inspired by the U-Net model, adapted into the AC-PF while considering the available training data. Finally, the Dice similarity score is computed for a specific image compared to the ground truth images and the corresponding input images.","",https://doi.org/10.14445/23488549/ijece-v11i11p122,"",,

This study focuses on monitoring, predicting and understanding land cover changes in the basin from 1987 to 2018, with projections up to 2030. It explores the intricate relationship between population growth and land cover dynamics, aiming to contribute to sustainable land management practices and align with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for 2030. Using a combination of neural network classification and the CA-Markov model, the study analyses historical land cover data to identify significant transformations. Between 1987 and 2018, bare lands increased by 29%, vegetation increased by 14%, built-up areas increased by 128% and waterbodies increased by 10%, whereas there was a 58% decline in the extent of wetlands. The most significant transformation occurred in the wetlands, with a total of 1819.46 km2 being converted to various land cover types. The results demonstrate remarkable shifts characterised by rapid urbanisation, substantial wetland loss and a decline in vegetation cover. Expectedly, population growth is found to be closely linked to the expansion of built-up areas while negatively impacting other land cover types. These findings underscore the urgent need for sustainable land management strategies that balance the demands of growing populations with the preservation of natural ecosystems and biodiversity. Furthermore, the study provides future projections that offer crucial insights for decision-makers involved in land use planning, biodiversity conservation and sustainable development.","",https://doi.org/10.14746/quageo-2024-0011,"",,

Flood events are responsible for economic and life-threatening damages[1]. To mitigate flood risks and resulting damages, particularly in the construction of residential buildings, two approaches exist. First: constructing in areas with lower flood susceptibility, and second: implementing architectural solutions to fortify structures against floods and associated hazards. Due to the presence of water resources, rivers, etc., prompting urban expansion due to reasons like transportation, trade, agricultural use, household consumption, etc., construction near rivers and flood-prone areas becomes inevitable[2]. This underscores the importance of the second approach&amp;#8212;architectural fortification. In this study, areas highly susceptible to flooding were identified from flood zoning maps using artificial intelligence to adapt these maps and estimate the most hazardous regions[3]. Subsequently, by examining the specific elements of traditional architecture in each of these areas and exploring the cause and function of each element in facing floods over time, attention is given to the particular and regional (indigenous) architectural features that have responded to floods. Finally, appropriate architectural measures and responses to reduce flood risks, such as constructing at elevation or suitable gradients, is combined with early warning systems to provide a proper route for the future construction projects.

These trees provide vital ecosystem services, such as climate regulation, carbon sequestration, and habitat and food provision. Trees are also deeply interconnected with humans, offering social and cultural values. The interdependence between trees and humans underlines the urgency to understand and protect trees in both natural and urban ecosystems amid climate change and other environmental pressures, including deforestation, land degradation, and pollution. This virtual issue examines five critical themes of trees and forests and their societal impact. Over 3 trillion trees occupy the Earth's land surface, mostly in tropical and subtropical forests (~1.3 trillion) (Crowther et al., 2015). These trees provide vital ecosystem services, such as climate regulation, carbon sequestration, and habitat and food provision (Brockerhoff et al., 2017; Myers, 1997). Trees are also deeply interconnected with humans, offering social and cultural values (O'Brien, 2005). The interdependence between trees and humans underlines the urgency to understand and protect trees in both natural and urban ecosystems amid climate change and other environmental pressures, including deforestation, land degradation, and pollution (De Marco et al., 2022; Esperon-Rodriguez, Tjoelker, et al., 2022; Kumar et al., 2022; Lindner et al., 2010). This virtual issue examines five critical themes of trees and forests and their societal impact. Each theme provides insights into cultural significance, ecosystem contributions, resilience and restoration, and technological innovations in conservation. In 'Climate Resilience and Adaptive Strategies of Trees', researchers investigate how trees adapt to climate change through resilience and genetic diversity with studies on urban forest adaptation, genetic variation, and seasonal responses of tree species. 'Forest Restoration and Biodiversity Conservation' shows strategies that enhance biodiversity and climate mitigation with diverse reforestation practices. In 'Trees and Human Culture', the research explores the cultural value of trees, focusing on the historical and societal importance of native and commercial species and their role in local traditions and economies. The authors of work featured in 'Trees as Ecosystem Engineers' highlight how trees contribute to biodiversity and support livelihoods, with studies on societal perceptions, species interactions, and endemic conservation efforts. Lastly, 'Technological Advances in Forest Monitoring and Conservation' delves into tools like UAVs and genetic analyses that aid in monitoring and preserving forests. Together, these themes offer a comprehensive view of trees' essential roles across ecosystems, human culture, and emerging conservation efforts. As a response to climate change and urbanization, researchers highlight the need to enhance urban forest resilience. Urban forests, essential for decreasing urban heat and improving air quality and human well-being (Keeler et al., 2019), face risks from climate-induced stress. To secure the provision of these benefits to urban residents, Esperon-Rodriguez, Rymer, et al. (2022) emphasize the importance of selecting tree species suited to the projected climate conditions in cities along with other desirable characteristics, such as aesthetic value and biodiversity support. By assessing the risks to heat, drought, and pest outbreaks, urban planners can make informed decisions to increase the longevity of urban trees and secure the services they provide (Esperon-Rodriguez, Rymer, et al., 2022). Urban environments present unique challenges and opportunities for tree resilience. Sjöman et al. (2024) examined how genetic diversity within tree species (i.e., intraspecific variation) supports resilience to urban stresses, such as pollution and limited water availability. The authors suggest that by focusing on resilient tree varieties, urban forestry initiatives can improve biodiversity and ecosystem function within cities, fostering healthier urban landscapes that also contribute to climate resilience. Species, however, respond differently to local environmental conditions. For example, Goessen et al. (2022) explored how tree species have diverse adaptations driven by geographic conditions. Their study focused on Populus tremuloides, or Quaking aspen, a species native to North America, has developed divergent strategies in response to local environmental constraints, reflecting the role of genetic diversity in resilience. In Japan, Miyawaki-Kuwakado et al. (2024) investigated how warming temperatures affect the timing of seasonal events like bud dormancy. Their research on the iconic Yoshino cherry tree (Cerasus × yedoensis) showed that climate change may lead to mistimed flowering. Such shifts threaten species reliant on specific climatic triggers, raising concerns about the long-term viability of temperature-sensitive species in changing climates. Importantly, these changes can also have socio-economic disruptions, as the blossoming of cherries is an important tourism resource (Murata et al., 2012). Similar results were found in the Singapore Botanic Gardens, where Ho et al. (2024) conducted a long-term assessment of changes in leafing behavior of tropical trees in response to climate change. They found that tropical trees can adjust their leafing behavior over extended periods, showcasing their adaptive capacity. By focusing on adaptive capacity, genetic diversity, and optimal species selection, this research offers pathways to enhance forest resilience and sustain the ecological and social benefits that trees provide. Forest restoration plays a critical role in climate change mitigation and biodiversity conservation as global efforts aim to reverse deforestation and land degradation (Bastin et al., 2019). Andres et al. (2023) sought to define the term ""biodiverse reforestation"" and explained why this matters for climate change mitigation and biodiversity. The authors emphasize the importance of integrating biodiversity goals into reforestation efforts. By prioritizing species diversity, reforestation projects can sequester carbon more effectively while supporting ecosystem functions and species. This represents a more resilient and sustainable approach to forest restoration. Importantly, the authors consider the potential for improving scientific approaches to biodiverse reforestation with First Nations perspectives. The co-benefits of Indigenous knowledge and values have been recognized as vital to climate adaptation (Nursey-Bray et al., 2022). In restoration, ensuring water efficiency in seedlings is crucial, especially under climate stress. Krishnan et al. (2023) examined how organic nitrogen can enhance water-use efficiency in tropical tree seedlings. They showed that nutrient addition allowed seedlings to establish more effectively under dry conditions, suggesting practical strategies for forest restoration projects in arid regions. This has important repercussions not only for restoration but also for food production. For example, in regions where food security and forest health are closely linked, selecting appropriate tree species is essential. A study in Burkina Faso, West Africa, by Vinceti et al. (2022) explored how tree species contribute to both ecological restoration and local nutrition. By including species that provide food, like fruit-bearing trees, reforestation initiatives in Burkina Faso can address both environmental and community needs, creating landscapes that support biodiversity while improving food security. Local and small-scale efforts, such as home gardens, also play a significant role in supporting biodiversity and for conservation. Offord and Zimmer (2024) studied how home gardeners help preserve the critically endangered Wollemi Pine (Wollemia nobilis). This species native to Australia was described as new to science in 1994 and is represented by fewer than 100 individuals (Trueman et al., 2007). By cultivating Wollemi Pine in private gardens, individuals contribute to broader conservation goals, ensuring genetic diversity and supporting efforts to reintroduce the species into its natural habitat (Offord & Zimmer, 2024). This approach highlights the value of community-based conservation in supporting endangered species and enhancing biodiversity. Trees and forests have profound cultural and economic value, reflecting centuries of human interaction and local knowledge (O'Brien, 2005). Recent research investigates the cultural, economic, and social significance of tree species, focusing on the importance of identity, naming, and preservation of species. Dunbar-Wallis et al. (2023) highlight the significance of preserving historic North American apple (Malus domestica) varieties. Their study showed how naming and identifying these apples maintain cultural heritage and biodiversity. North American apples represent historical practices and tastes, underscoring the importance of preserving these genetic resources as part of local identity and resilience. Notably, M. domestica is one of the most cultivated fruits worldwide (ranked fourth) with an average annual production of over 85 million tons globally (FAOSTAT, 2020). For the wild apple (Malus sylvestris), Ruhsam et al. (2023) took the challenge of accurately identifying the nursery stock sold in nurseries from the United Kingdom. Wild apple species are vital for genetic diversity and resilience, and ensuring authenticity in nursery stock is crucial for conservation. This research highlights the importance of preserving genetic integrity and maintaining access to wild species, which are valuable for both biodiversity and cultural heritage. Studying a culturally significant species, the barnī date palm variety, a local elite variety of al-'Ulā oasis in Saudi Arabia, Gros-Balthazard et al. (2023) found that this variety is not only an economic staple but also a cultural icon in the region. Through its name and cultivation, the barnī date palm represents a rich heritage that has sustained communities for generations, illustrating how plant varieties can embody place-based knowledge and cultural ties. In a similar study, Gurung et al. (2024) explored the cultural and medicinal significance of Buddleja asiatica, a shrub native to the East Indies. In the Pan-Himalayan region, this species is integral to local healthcare practices, providing essential medicinal benefits to communities. Its use reflects a traditional knowledge system and highlights the symbiotic relationship between people and native plant species, demonstrating the role of trees in supporting cultural identity and local health. Trees as ecosystem engineers (i.e., organisms responsible for the creation and maintenance of habitats; Jones et al., 1996) can change the abiotic context upon which biotic interactions depend (Byers et al., 2006). Thus, community livelihoods rely on identifying threats and benefits provided by trees. Tsvuura et al. (2023) explored gender perspectives on the perceived benefits and threats of tree restoration in South Africa. They explored how communities view trees as valuable contributors to their livelihoods, recognizing the critical role trees play in providing resources such as timber, fruit, and medicinal products. However, this study also highlights concerns regarding threats to these benefits, such as climate change, deforestation, and urbanization. These threats challenge the sustainability of the services that communities depend on, underscoring the need for strategies that secure tree resources while balancing conservation and economic needs (Sivakumar et al., 2024). In Yemen, Maděra et al. (2024) studied 11 endemic frankincense tree (Boswellia) taxa in the Socotra Archipelago. These species are culturally and economically valuable to local communities. However, frankincense trees are also threatened by overharvesting, habitat loss, and climate change, threatening local biodiversity and the communities reliant on them for livelihood. Maděra et al.'s study provides a detailed ecological assessment identifying regions at most risk and offers insights into conservation strategies that balance sustainable use with the preservation of genetic diversity. The conservation of frankincense trees is critical not only for the ecosystem but also for supporting traditional practices and economic stability for people in the region. As hosts for other species, trees can develop complex interactions, such as the relationship between strangler figs and their host trees, studied by Mo et al. (2024). Strangler figs start life on host trees, gradually growing and often overtaking the host tree's structure. While this interaction may seem parasitic, it can enhance urban green spaces by adding unique biodiversity and aesthetic value. This study suggests that, when managed properly, strangler figs can enrich urban ecosystems by creating microhabitats for multiple species, supporting urban biodiversity, and improving the resilience of green spaces (Mo et al., 2024). This research highlights the dual ecological and cultural significance of these trees in urban landscapes. Modern technologies like AI, UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles), and genetic tools are shaping a new era in the conservation, management, and monitoring of forests worldwide. By combining UAV surveys, genetic analysis, advanced forestry tools, and ground-based monitoring, researchers and managers can make informed decisions about forest conservation and sustainable use. These technologies not only improve our understanding of forest ecosystems but also facilitate enforcing regulations, planning conservation strategies, and adapting to climate change impacts on forests. In Madagascar, Williams (2024) used UAVs to monitor deforestation in real-time. Madagascar harbors a unique biodiversity, but this is threatened by illegal logging (Ralimanana et al., 2022). UAVs enable rapid, cost-effective detection of deforestation, offering precise data on forest loss and allowing authorities to respond promptly to illegal activities (Williams, 2024). In a global review of emerging tools to support sustainable forestry, Bunney et al. (2023) focused on protecting sandalwood species (a variety of species in the family Santalaceae), which are culturally and economically valuable and threatened by overharvesting. This review examined different methods, including DNA barcoding, to verify the species of harvested wood and remote sensing for forest monitoring. Together, these studies demonstrate the importance of combining drones, remote sensing, and genetic tools for comprehensive forest conservation strategies. The role of genomics in understanding the resilience of tree species was studied by Kong et al. (2023). Prosopis alba, native to arid environments, possesses genetic traits that allow it to withstand extreme drought and saline conditions. By mapping the genome of P. alba, Kong et al. demonstrated species adaptability, which can inform breeding programs aimed at enhancing the resilience of trees in regions facing water scarcity and climate stress. Genomic tools enable targeted conservation of tree species that are vital to ecosystem stability in extreme climates (Isabel et al., 2020). Finally, in a study using ground-based data, Anderson-Teixeira et al. (2024) showed that effective forest carbon inventories require precise measurements of carbon stocks. Technologies such as remote sensing paired with field data can provide reliable estimates. This approach enhances the accuracy of reporting forest carbon, helping countries meet their climate goals and track the effectiveness of conservation efforts. Collectively, these studies show the essential roles that trees play in both natural and urban environments, particularly in the face of climate change and environmental pressures. They reveal how trees adapt to climate changes, underscoring the importance of genetic diversity and adaptive strategies to strengthen climate-resilient forestry. This knowledge supports informed species selection and management to foster resilient forests that benefit both ecosystems and communities. A multi-faceted approach to forest restoration, one that incorporates ecological, cultural, and social factors, emerges as crucial for sustaining biodiversity while meeting community needs. These studies highlight trees as cultural symbols and economic resources, essential for preserving cultural identity and biodiversity. Trees also serve as ecosystem engineers, offering ecosystem services that support biodiversity, air quality, and water regulation, while facing significant threats from human impact. Notably, technological advancements and emerging tools are transforming forest conservation and monitoring, providing researchers with tools to better protect and manage forest ecosystems. Together, these studies provide insights and innovations toward more sustainable and resilient ecosystems that benefit both the environment and society. MER wrote this article.

rayyan-210790047,Examining the Feasibility of GeoAI and IoT for Smart Flood Early Warning Systems in Local Communities for Caribbean Urban Spaces,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Over the last few decades, flooding has resulted in many problems that significantly impact countries in the Caribbean. This has been especially challenging in urban areas where widespread damage has occurred. In addition, given that over 50% of the world's population lives in urban areas, these locations are deemed to be vulnerable to climate-related disaster events that would further exacerbate the challenges in the region. These urban spaces in the Caribbean have limited access to real-time flood monitoring data for formulating and supporting policies for disaster practitioners to coordinate timely preparedness and mitigation efforts. While flooding is complex, with a series of negative impacts on social and economic sectors, it is essential to provide a basis to support decision-making information on vulnerability and resilience through early warning systems (EWS). However, the main obstacle in creating early warnings in the Caribbean is the suitability and availability of data for real-time flood prediction. While many methods of flood models have been applied in the traditional ways, the methods are complex and not readily adaptable to the context of the local community spaces, especially with limited available data. The Caribbean urban landscape is dynamically changing, which requires careful monitoring for predicting flooding. In a disaster, informing the community is critical for managing flooding risk. The adoption of GeoAI and IoT prepares the next frontier of models for usage in the Caribbean to close the gaps of modeling in data scarcity in urban areas. Consequently, there is a research gap from the perspective of short-term forecasting for sudden rainfall events in urban spaces in the Caribbean. Given the early warning system culture in the Caribbean has an environment of real-time data of scarce resources, it is necessary to forge an approach for real-time forecasting flooding impact in urban spaces. The paper provides a preliminary analysis of the feasibility of machine learning and IoT use in supporting EWS in Caribbean urban spaces.","",https://doi.org/10.47412/swec5084,"",,

rayyan-210790123,A Review of Cutting-Edge Sensor Technologies for Improved Flood Monitoring and Damage Assessment,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Floods are the most destructive, widespread, and frequent natural hazards. The extent of flood events is accelerating in the context of climate change, where flood management and disaster mitigation remain important long-term issues. Different studies have been utilizing data and images from various types of sensors for mapping, assessment, forecasting, early warning, rescue, and other disaster prevention and mitigation activities before, during, and after floods, including flash floods, coastal floods, and urban floods. These monitoring processes evolved from early ground-based observations relying on in situ sensors to high-precision, high-resolution, and high-coverage monitoring by airborne and remote sensing sensors. In this study, we have analyzed the different kinds of sensors from the literature review, case studies, and other methods to explore the development history of flood sensors and the driving role of floods in different countries. It is found that there is a trend towards the integration of flood sensors with artificial intelligence, and their state-of-the-art determines the effectiveness of local flood management to a large extent. This study helps to improve the efficiency of flood monitoring advancement and flood responses as it explores the different types of sensors and their effectiveness.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/s24217090,"",,

This study used satellite imagery and machine learning to analyze the spatial and temporal patterns of land surface temperature distribution in the Metropolitan Area of Merida (MAM), Mexico, from 2001 to 2021. The results show that land surface temperature has increased in the MAM over the study period, while the urban footprint has expanded. The study also found a high correlation (r> 0.8) between changes in land surface temperature and land cover classes (urbanization/deforestation). If the current urbanization trend continues, the difference between the land surface temperature of the MAM and its surroundings is expected to reach 3.12 °C ± 1.11 °C by the year 2030. Hence, the findings of this study suggest that the Urban Heat Island effect is a growing problem in the MAM and highlight the importance of satellite imagery and machine learning for monitoring and developing mitigation strategies.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/s24196289,"",,

This study relied on remote sensing data to analyze and assess land use and land cover changes in Babil Province, Iraq, over the past two decades. The study focused on identifying the patterns and factors influencing these changes, using Landsat satellite imagery to create digital maps classifying land into four main categories: urban lands, bare soil lands, water bodies, and vegetation lands. The results showed a noticeable expansion of urban lands at the expense of bare soil lands, primarily attributed to population growth, economic development, and improved security conditions. This study underscores the importance of sustainable land management and urban planning in Babil Province. These results highlight the importance of sustainable land management in Babil Province, including sound urban planning considering urban expansion's environmental, social, and economic effects. The classification was implemented using a maximum likelihood classifier, and the accuracy assessment yielded satisfactory results with an overall accuracy of 93.5517%.

rayyan-210790378,Modeling Population Mobility Flows: A Hybrid Approach Integrating a Gravity Model and Machine Learning,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Population mobility between cities significantly affects traffic congestion, disease spread, and societal well-being. As globalization and urbanization accelerate, understanding the dynamics of population mobility becomes increasingly important. Traditional population migration models reveal the factors influencing migration, while machine learning methods provide effective tools for creating data-driven models to handle the nonlinear relationships between origin and destination characteristics and migration. To deepen the understanding of population mobility issues, this study presents GraviGBM, an expandable population mobility simulation model that combines the gravity model with machine learning, significantly enhancing simulation accuracy. By employing SHAPs (SHapley Additive exPlanations), we interpret the modeling results and explore the relationship between urban characteristics and population migration. Additionally, this study includes a case analysis of COVID-19, extending the model’s application during public health emergencies and evaluating the contribution of model variables in this context. The results show that GraviGBM performs exceptionally well in simulating inter-city population migration, with an RMSE of 4.28, far lower than the RMSE of the gravity model (45.32). This research indicates that distance emerged as the primary factor affecting mobility before the pandemic, with economic factors and population also playing significant roles. During the pandemic, distance remained dominant, but the significance of short distances gained importance. Pandemic-related indicators became prominent, while economics, population density, and transportation substantially lost their influence. A city-to-city flow analysis shows that when population sizes are comparable, economic factors prevail, but when economic profiles match, living conditions dictate migration. During the pandemic, residents from hard-hit areas moved to more distant cities, seeking normalcy. This research offers a comprehensive perspective on population mobility, yielding valuable insights for future urban planning, pandemic response, and decision-making processes.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/ijgi13110379,"",,
rayyan-210790443,How to Coordinate Urban Ecological Networks and Street Green Space Construction? Insights from a Multi-Scale Perspective,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Rapid socio-economic development and imbalanced ecosystem conservation have heightened the risk of species extinction, reduced urban climate adaptability, and threatened human health and well-being. Constructing ecological green space networks is an effective strategy for maintaining urban ecological security. However, most studies have primarily addressed biodiversity needs, with limited focus on coordinating street spaces in human settlement planning. This study examines the area within Chengdu’s Third Ring Road, employing the following methodologies: (1) constructing the regional ecological network using Morphological Spatial Pattern Analysis (MSPA), the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Trade-offs (InVEST) model, and circuit theory; (2) analyzing the street green view index (GVI) through machine learning semantic segmentation techniques; and (3) identifying key areas for the coordinated development of urban ecological networks and street green spaces using bivariate spatial correlation analysis. The results showed that (1) Chengdu’s Third Ring Road exhibits high ecological landscape fragmentation, with 41 key ecological sources and 94 corridors identified. Ecological pinch points were located near urban rivers and surrounding woodlands, while ecological barrier points were concentrated in areas with dense buildings and complex transportation networks. (2) Higher street GVI values were observed around university campuses, urban parks, and river-adjacent streets, while lower GVI values were found near commercial areas and transportation hubs. (3) To coordinate the construction of ecological networks and street green spaces, the central area of the First Ring Road and the northwestern region of the Second and Third Ring Roads were identified as priority restoration areas, while the northern, western, and southeastern areas of the Second and Third Ring Roads were designated as priority protection areas. This study adopts a multi-scale spatial perspective to identify priority areas for protection and restoration, aiming to coordinate the construction of urban ecological networks and street green spaces and provide new insights for advancing ecological civilization in high-density urban areas.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/land14010026,"",,
rayyan-210790455,Understanding the Relationship Between Urban Form Factors and Extreme Heat in Seoul,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Climate change has been a pressing global issue and people are experiencing more frequent and severer extreme weather events.In South Korea, extreme heat has been drawing much attention in recent years due to its significant impact on public health and energy and water consumptions.Extreme heat is particularly exacerbated by the urban heat island (UHI) effect in cities.Many studies have examined the relationship between urban form factors and surface UHI empirically.But few of them have studied how UHI changes in response to an extreme heat event, termed heat resilience in recent studies.Additionally, most of current studies used traditional regression models assuming linear relationships, which may not be the case for UHI effects.To address this gap, this study aims to identify nonlinear relationships between urban form factors and land surface temperature (LST) and heat resilience, using machine learning methods.The study adopted the gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) models to predict LST and heat resilience and compared the findings with those using spatial regression models.The results suggest that the GBDT model has a higher prediction power than traditional regression, and the GBDT models show that the urban form factors have nonlinear relationships with LST and heat resilience under extreme heat.The findings of the study provide valuable guidance for urban planning practice aimed at prioritizing planning elements in urban form toward heat-resilient cities.","",https://doi.org/10.46855/energy-proceedings-11065,"",,

Mapping flood hazard areas are crucial for mitigating potential damage to human life and property. However, conventional hydrodynamic approaches are hindered by their extensive data requirements and computational expenses. As an alternative solution, this paper explores the use of machine learning (ML) techniques to map flood hazards based on readily available geo-environmental variables. We employed various ML classifiers, including decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), XGBoost (XGB), and k-nearest neighbor (kNN), to assess their performance in flood hazard mapping. Model evaluation was conducted using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and root mean square error (RMSE). Our results demonstrated promising outcomes, with AUC values of 93% (DT), 97% (RF), 98% (XGB), and 91% (kNN) for the validation dataset. RF and XGB have slightly higher performance than DT and kNN and distance to river was the most important factor. The study highlights the potential of ML for urban flood modeling, offering reasonable accuracy and supporting early warning systems.

Among the measures aimed at minimizing the consequences of floods, the most noteworthy are the empirical models linked with new technologies in a promising way and with lower financial cost compared to the models. Thus, a flood forecast model with applicability improved by new technologies becomes a protagonist in reducing the impacts caused by floods. The aim of this study is to compare urban flood prediction models using data mining, geo-processing (GIS) and machine learning techniques. The results illustrate the feasibility of applying in urban areas from the case study, with the aim of contributing to the management of urban environment disasters. Predicting the occurrence of floods is fundamental for alerting the riverside population and for mobilizing the civil defense action teams. To do so, models for forecasting flooding were drawn up one day in advance, where the results obtained from the models built with the techniques for classifying the rules showed satisfactory results. Therefore, forecasting the occurrence of urban floods can be used as a tool to support decision-making to guide the actions of the public authorities in the management of this type of disaster. The knowledge presented seeks to contribute in the debates on socio-environmental issues and public policies.

rayyan-210790527,ANNUAL PAST-PRESENT LAND COVER CLASSIFICATION FROM LANDSAT USING DEEP LEARNING FOR URBAN AGGLOMERATIONS,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Historical land cover data is crucial for understanding urbanization dynamics, climate modeling, and monitoring water resources. Following recent advancements in deep learning for processing Landsat archive data, prior studies have released high-resolution historical land cover maps on a global scale. However, these works often present prediction results limited to specific periods of coverage, which hinders their utility in conducting time series analysis across different urban agglomerations. To address this issue, we propose deep-learning models for land cover classification from Landsat images at a 30-meter spatial resolution. Our models are specifically designed for urban areas and are trained to be compatible with the sensors used in the Landsat series from 1972 to the present. Experimental results demonstrate that our models are highly effective in predicting land cover maps in new cities, particularly in built-up land and water regions.

rayyan-210790582,rain-t: Daily Rainfall Predictive Model Using 6-Gene Genetic Expression for Historical Data-Based Forecasting,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Extreme weather conditions such as heavy rainfalls have been wreaking havoc not only in urban areas but also in an entire watershed. The development of a flood management plan and flood mitigating structures to alleviate the impacts of flooding is very crucial because it needs intensive and continuous historical data. However, missing data due to equipment failure that gathers the rainfall data could be a problem. Rainfall data is not only useful in designing flood mitigating structures but also in planning our day-to-day activities ahead of time. To address this problem, this paper proposes a predictive model which able to forecast in a short lead-time and predict missing data within the dataset. In this paper, three predictive models will be compared namely recurrent neural network, Gaussian processing regression, and the proposed 6-gene genetic expression-based predictive modeling (MGGP). 29-year 24-hour cumulative rainfall data which were sourced in PAGASA Tacloban city weather station, Philippines, was used. The data were cleaned by removing negative values. Two datasets were created, the first (RFDS1) dataset which makes use of three indices (year, month, and days), and the second (RFDS2) dataset which was orchestrated and transformed to increase correlation and reduce prediction errors which had an additional two datasets (ave(t-1,t-2),t-1). Each method used three and five time-based indices. The result shows an erratic behavior of the model from three methods that used the RFDS1, while RFDS2 had a more stable predictive model. This shows that the data orchestration and transformation greatly improved the correlation and reduced errors. However, MGGP showed the best results among the three methods.","",https://doi.org/10.20965/jaciii.2024.p0005,"",,

Access refers to the availability of urban greenspace, while accessibility indicates the ease of reaching and enjoying these greenspaces and the quality of greenspace services. However, quantitative studies to interpret such difference between accessibility and access are limited. To contribute to this gap, this study developed a Spatial Delta Model (SDM) to quantify the difference between accessibility and access to greenspace and assess its spatial characteristics. The study examines the block-level access, accessibility, and their difference in Perth, Australia, using the SDM with a series of high-resolution greenspace and socio-economic spatial data. Access was calculated as the total greenspace near residential blocks and accessibility was derived using a modified Gaussian two-step floating catchment area (MG2SFCA) approach. Once they were quantified, a set of residential, morphological, and greenspace related factors were utilised to explain the spatial patterns of the difference between accessibility and access using a machine learning geographical detector model.

The severity of UHI associated with heat waves and heat stress-related mortality is now one of the major concerns, particularly in densely populated cities. Therefore, the significance of the UHI has emerged as a crucial issue due to cities' fast growth and urban development, necessitating a comprehensive review of the present status of UHI research, particularly concerning regional comparisons. This paper delineates the characteristics of UHI, focusing on its intensity, impact, determining factors, and potential mitigation strategy. It synthesizes an insight into important aspects of UHI from a comprehensive analysis of over 400 national/international research articles. The findings indicate a lack of UHI research studies in the central and eastern regions of the country, bringing out the need for further investigation in these areas. The observed UHI intensity varies across the country between 2 and 10 °C, with the northwest seeing a more pronounced temperature gradient. Following a detailed review, a few suggestions for future research to minimize the impact of UHI on public health, energy consumption, and the economy are proposed, as are strategies for mitigation. While studies on UHIs in India have primarily relied on observational data, there is still a substantial need for more research on employing numerical model-based and machine-learning approaches. Furthermore, the availability of mitigation research on Indian cities is limited. Additional research is needed to ascertain the intricate mechanisms behind the UHI effect on cities vulnerable to various climatic risks and hazards.","",https://doi.org/10.1007/s44327-024-00033-3,"",,
rayyan-210790722,Multi-Sensor Satellite Data Analysis for Urban Land Use Pattern Recognition,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract A global phenomenon, urbanization is characterized by the expansion of cities and rapid growth of urban areas. As cities continue to grow, assessing the distribution and trends in land use is increasingly essential to identify, connect, quantify, validate, and predict the negative consequences of urban areas on the environment. In recent decades, the availability of multi-sensor data has revolutionized and emerged as a promising approach for improving efficiency and precision, and each sensor provides distinct capabilities as well as characteristics that make it possible for an in-depth assessment of urban land use. In this context, this research aims to understand the optical data for urban land use mapping using high-resolution remote sensing satellite imagery of different periods. Traditional and machine learning techniques are used to classify urban land use patterns. The results revealed a major land use change with more built-up regions. Urban land area increased from 36.52 % (2012) to 60.23 % (2023), indicating significant urbanization. Additionally, random forest outperformed methods in comparison analysis. Moreover, the significance of this present study is that it offers insightful information into structural and spectral features of urban areas and emphasizes how precise land use classification is crucial for efficient land management, urban planning, and sustainable urban development. The study also exhibits different sources of data from different types of sensors, indicating the possible usage under any condition for emergency monitoring and immediate response.","",https://doi.org/10.1088/1755-1315/1412/1/012032,"",,

The advancement of deep neural networks has significantly improved forecasting performance. However, a notable challenge lies in the ability of these models to generalize well to out-of-distribution (OOD) time series data. The inherent spatial heterogeneity and domain shifts across urban environments create hurdles that prevent models from adapting and performing effectively in new urban environments. To tackle this problem, we propose a solution to derive invariant representations for more robust predictions under different urban environments instead of relying on spurious correlation across urban environments for better generalizability. Through extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world data, we demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms traditional time series forecasting models when tackling domain shifts in changing urban environments. The effectiveness and robustness of our method can be extended to diverse fields including climate modeling, urban planning, and smart city resource management.","",https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2405.05430,"",,

Using the CiteSpace tool, we explore research hotspots, disciplinary developments, significant contributors, and influential literature in this field, identifying current research gaps and predicting future trends. The findings indicate that GI significantly impacts the reduction of air pollution, the regulation of urban microclimates, and the enhancement of ecosystem services. However, existing studies often focus on isolated aspects and lack comprehensive assessments. Moreover, the research trajectory in this field shows a declining trend. Future research should emphasize interdisciplinary integration, combining ecology, urban planning, meteorology, and public health. By utilizing advanced technologies, such as drones, remote sensing, AI, and big data analysis, we can improve data accuracy and the generalizability of research findings.

Istanbul, the largest city in Turkey, has experienced a significant surge in population, from approximately 10 million in 2000 to nearly 16 million by 2020, driving extensive urban development. This growth has led to the encroachment on green spaces and agricultural lands, exacerbating environmental challenges such as the loss of biodiversity, alteration of ecosystems, and increased vulnerability to natural hazards like earthquakes and floods. Remote sensing and GIS technologies have proven vital in monitoring these land cover changes and assessing ecological impacts. The paper explores the socio-economic implications of urbanization, including increased pressure on urban infrastructure, labor market dynamics, and land use conflicts. It highlights the need for sustainable urban planning that integrates ecological conservation, socioeconomic factors, and resilience to climate change. Future research directions emphasize the role of hyperspectral remote sensing, machine learning, and interdisciplinary collaboration in fostering more effective urban development strategies.

Urban agriculture can sustain food demand and contribute to food security, environmental sustainability, and community health. However, soil‐related factors in urban agricultural systems pose unique challenges not found in more rural environments, and issues such as soil fertility, soil biodiversity, soil contamination, and existing policy demand further investigation to deepen and enhance the potential contribution of urban agriculture to livability in urban areas. This special issue collects studies to support the need for sustainable soil management, crop diversification, and management strategies for optimal soil health and good crop yield and quality. In addition, the issue examines recent advances in remote sensing technologies and deep learning techniques that offer potential tools for soil health monitoring and plant disease detection related to existing plant‐based contamination, providing a way forward to make informed decisions for policy stakeholders and land planners. Combining these initiatives into urban planning and public health policies could have a considerable impact on urban well‐being and resilience.","",https://doi.org/10.1002/uar2.20062,"",,

The necessity of monitoring and predicting urban growth trends lies in the establishment and maintenance of sustainability. The objective of this work is to utilize the Spatial Lag Model to analyze the urban growth pattern of the Asansol-Durgapur region. The aim is to investigate the interconnections between the factors contributing to urban growth. Additionally, The Cellular Automata-based SLEUTH model will be employed to forecast the likelihood of future growth in the region. The accurate modeling and prediction of urban areas necessitate the consideration of multiple variables and the utilization of big datasets, hence posing a significant challenge to researchers. The research reveals that the existence of multimodal infrastructure, such as well-connected roads, highways, and railroads, that offer convenient accessibility, along with neighbourhood development and, the presence of vacant lands in the vicinity, has a crucial role in driving population migration toward urban regions, hence contributing to urban expansion. These results aid in developing policy measures and sustainable actions to mitigate urbanization’s anthropogenic effects.

This study focuses on the dual pilot policy of low-carbon cities and climate resilient cities, establishing a comprehensive evaluation index system for urban low-carbon resilience that encompasses ecological, economic, social, and institutional dimensions. Utilizing panel data from 286 prefecture-level cities and above in China from 2005 to 2021, this study employs Difference-in-Differences, K-means clustering, Double Machine Learning, and a tri-dimensional policy analysis framework of ""policy instruments—policy pathways—policy objectives."" It provides an in-depth assessment of the dual pilot policy's impact through policy synergy effects, policy tool analysis, and key case studies, supplemented by heterogeneity analysis, mechanism analysis, and cluster analysis. Results indicate that the dual pilot policy significantly enhances the low-carbon resilience of pilot cities, outperforming the effects seen in cities with a singular pilot policy. The policy effects vary among different types of pilot cities, with notably significant impacts in cities facing high temperatures, low temperatures, heavy rainfall, and high disaster risks. Cities characterized by higher levels of low-carbon resilience (categorized as MMHM) manifest more consistent policy synergy effects, whereas cities with lower levels of resilience (classified as LLLL) exhibit some disparities. The study also identifies the strengthening of green technology innovation, human capital development, and communication infrastructure construction as key factors enhancing policy effectiveness. Ultimately, this research underscores the importance of the diversity and combination of policy tools, as well as the multidimensionality and synergy of policy objectives, for effective climate action. It recommends that urban managers consider the synergistic effects of climate change mitigation and adaptation measures when formulating climate policies.","",https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-5309703/v1,"",,
rayyan-210791066,Space‐for‐time substitutions exaggerate urban bird–habitat ecological relationships,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract North American bird abundance has declined by 29% over the last 50 years. These continental population dynamics interact with local landscape changes to affect local bird diversity. Mitigating local declines in cities is particularly significant because (a) such declines greatly impact human–bird relationships since most people live in cities and (b) cities provide levers to create bird‐friendly habitat, such as managing yards and gardens, street trees, and urban parks. Yet, the potential for cities to modify habitats to mitigate broader bird declines remains unclear. Studies have been stymied by the difficulty of assembling mutidecadal habitat–bird population datasets. Instead, studies have substituted space for time (e.g. used habitat associations across space at one time point to project future species abundance due to changing land use), but this method may fail amidst nonstationary environments of the Anthropocene. Here, we test the validity of space‐for‐time substitutions for explaining changes in bird abundance in a North American city over the past two decades by examining the degree to which these changes are explainable by changes in local landcover at multiple spatial scales. Specifically, we use longitudinal urban bird surveys of Metro Vancouver, BC, Canada from 1997 and 2020; deep learning models of remote sensing data to classify contemporaneous landcover; out‐of‐sample prediction and boosted regression trees to identify multiple spatial scales of landcover that best explained bird abundance (i.e. optimal scale of effect for each species by each habitat); and Bayesian multispecies abundance models in Stan to determine relationships between changes in landcover and bird abundance. We found that total bird abundance declined by 26% over the last two decades. Landcover measured at both 50 m and optimal scales explained spatial variation in bird abundance, but only landcover at the optimal scale explained temporal changes, and only partially. These results suggest that space‐for‐time substitutions overemphasize habitat–bird ecological relationships, urban habitats only partially determine bird abundance, and measuring habitat at the appropriate scale is important for capturing the most relevant changes in landscapes.","",https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2656.14194,"",,
rayyan-210791173,Knowledge-Based Identification of Urban Green Spaces: Allotments,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract. Urban Green Spaces (UGS) play a crucial role in enhancing the quality of life in cities by providing numerous environmental, social, and health benefits. Among these green spaces, allotment gardens stand out as a unique type that contributes to ecological services, preservation of biodiversity, and the overall well-being of urban dwellers. Unfortunately, the significance of allotment gardens as a specific type of UGS is still disregarded and they are not recognized as a separate category in land use / land cover maps or city maps of green spaces. This is mainly due to the mixed use of allotment areas, their small size and absence of tailored identification or mapping workflows. In this research, we address the latter one by proposing an approach that utilizes various semantic characteristics of allotment gardens to create distinctive spatial representations. The semantic characteristics we consider include the presence, density, and height of garden huts, proximity to water bodies and railroads, as well as the presence of pathways within the allotment gardens. Allotments are delineated using a three-step procedure. This involves utilizing a Random Forest machine learning classifier to create maps of the distribution of green spaces, extracting garden huts employing a threshold, and demarcating the area using a density based clustering technique. Furthermore, we repeat the same workflow in a new study area to assess the applicability of the proposed workflow. With the established workflow, we are able to accurately identify 78% of allotments in Augsburg and 88% in Wuerzburg respectively. Our results demonstrate that the proposed workflow can be a useful approach to validate and extend existing land use and land cover data sets while remaining time and cost effective.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/agile-giss-5-8-2024,"",,

In Meherpur District, Bangladesh, limited research has integrated LULC mapping with predictive models, resulting in a gap in knowledge regarding future land use patterns in this fast-changing region. This study addresses that gap by analyzing LULC changes from 2000 to 2024 using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Geographic Information Systems (GIS), and the Cellular Automata (CA) model for predictive analysis. The study reveals significant LULC changes over the 24-year period, including an 18% decrease in vegetation cover, a 6% reduction in agricultural land, and a 4% increase in built-up areas. These trends align with global patterns of urban expansion, often at the expense of agricultural and natural land. Additionally, increases in fallow land (7%) and water bodies (8%) indicate changing land use driven by population growth and infrastructure development. The loss of vegetation, in particular, poses risks to biodiversity, climate regulation, and food security. An innovative aspect of this research is the use of the CA model with the MOLUSCE plugin in QGIS, enabling simulations of future LULC changes up to 2032. This predictive approach offers insights into the impacts of ongoing urbanization, unlike previous studies in Bangladesh that mainly focused on historical LULC changes. The study suggests several future research directions, including investigating the socio-economic drivers of LULC changes, expanding the geographic scope to neighboring regions, and incorporating advanced remote sensing and machine learning techniques to enhance the accuracy of predictions. In conclusion, this research fills a critical gap in LULC studies in Meherpur by combining historical analysis with predictive modeling, offering valuable insights for policymakers to guide sustainable land use planning amidst ongoing urbanization and agricultural development.","",https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-5275701/v1,"",,

rayyan-210791228,Navigating Ecological–Economic Interactions: Spatiotemporal Dynamics and Drivers in the Lower Reaches of the Jinsha River,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"The lower reaches of the Jinsha River, serving as a vital ecological barrier in southwestern China and playing a crucial role in advancing targeted poverty alleviation efforts, remain underexplored in terms of the coupling between ecological and economic development, creating a gap in understanding the region’s sustainable development potential. This study combines the remote sensing ecological index (RSEI) derived from MODIS data and the biodiversity richness index (BRI) based on land use data to create the ecological environment index (EEI) using a weighted approach. It also develops the economic development index (EDI) from economic data using the entropy weight method. By integrating the EEI and EDI, the study calculates key metrics, including the ecological–economic coupling degree (EECD), coupling coordination degree (EECCD), and relative development degree (EERDD), and examines their spatiotemporal changes from 2000 to 2020. Additionally, the study applies a geographic detector model to identify the spatial drivers of the EEI, an obstacle factor diagnosis model to pinpoint the main barriers to EDI, and a neural network model to uncover the underlying forces shaping EECCD. The results indicate that: (I) From 2000 to 2020, the overall improvement rate of the ecological and economic subsystems was greater than that of the ecological–economic coupling system. The entire region is still in the Running-In Stage, and the coordination level has been upgraded from near imbalance to marginal coordination. About 85% of the counties’ EERDDs are still in the EDI Behind EEI Stage. (II) The structural composition of the EEI shows a pattern of low Dry Hot Valley Area and high in other areas, mainly driven by natural factors, although human activities had a notable impact on these interactions. (III) Originating from an impact model primarily driven by economic factors and supplemented by ecological factors, both EDI and EECCD exhibit a pattern of high in the south and low in the north, with improvements spreading northward from the urban area of Kunming. The development gradient differences between 24 poverty-stricken counties and 16 non-poverty-stricken counties have been reduced. (IV) For the six types of ecological–economic coupling development zones, it is essential to adopt localized approaches tailored to the differences in resource and environmental characteristics and development stages. Key efforts should focus on enhancing ecological protection and restoration, increasing financial support, implementing ecological compensation mechanisms, and promoting innovative models for sustainable development.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/land13122159,"",,
rayyan-210791231,Ocean Sustainability,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"With over 70% of the Earth covered by oceans, humans have had an intricate relationship with oceans for thousands of years. They have been vital in the development of humanity and sustain us to this day. But now, our oceans are under threat across all scales. These threats are complex. Climate change is a unifying driver of many hazards—from the melting of the ice caps threatening sea levels to elevated sea temperatures, leading to mass coral reef bleaching. Overfishing and pollution have also further pushed stressed ecosystems to the brink. Therefore, living with our oceans sustainably is crucial. Cell Reports Sustainability recently attended the Ocean Sciences Meeting 2024, where the world's leading experts in ocean-related sciences presented their latest research. It is well known that only about 5% of our oceans have been explored and mapped with much still to discover. To begin to understand how to live sustainably with our oceans, we need this fundamental research. In our February issue, we published a paper by Mitch Lyons and colleagues, providing updated maps of global coral reef spatial coverage at a high resolution. Quantifying the current state of our marine ecosystems is one vital step in comprehending the impacts of climate change, fishing, and the resulting sustainability challenges. Approximately 40% of the global population live in coastal areas. These areas can face compounding hazards such as sea level rise and climate extreme events. Some cities like New Orleans, where the Ocean Sciences Meeting 2024 was held, are also subsiding, and thus further raising the potential hazard. In 2005, Hurricane Katrina exposed the devastating consequences of structural inequality in areas of New Orleans in which low-income communities and people of color were the most vulnerable to flooding generated by the hurricane. As progress is made with technical and nature-based solutions to sea level rise and flooding, justice must be at the heart of these sustainable solutions. While most of us will rarely, if ever, go out into the open ocean, our lifestyles on land directly impact them. Our rivers discharge our rubbish, waste, and chemical pollutants. Microplastics have made their way to the deepest parts of oceans. Polluting, supersized cargo ships circle the globe, carrying everything from food to cars to Legos for our every need and desire. We cannot isolate impacts in the oceans from actions on land. At Cell Reports Sustainability, we call for papers that span the broad remit of ocean sustainability research, from the state of marine ecosystems and the impacts of climate change to the solutions and policy needed.

rayyan-210791250,3D-GloBFP: the first global three-dimensional building footprint dataset,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract. Understanding urban vertical structures, particularly building heights, is essential for examining the intricate interaction between humans and their environment. Such datasets are indispensable for a variety of applications, including climate modeling, energy consumption analysis, and socioeconomic activities. Despite the importance of this information, previous studies have primarily focused on estimating building heights regionally at the grid scale, often resulting in datasets with limited coverage or spatial resolution. This limitation hampers comprehensive global analysis and the ability to generate actionable insights at finer scales. In this study, we developed a global building height map at the building footprint scale by leveraging Earth Observation (EO) datasets and advanced machine learning techniques. Our approach integrated multisource remote-sensing features and building morphology features to develop height estimation models using the extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) regression method across diverse global regions. This methodology allowed us to estimate the heights of individual buildings worldwide, culminating in the creation of the three-dimensional (3D) Global Building Footprints (3D-GloBFP) dataset for the year 2020. Our evaluation results show that the height estimation models perform exceptionally well at a global scale, with R2 values ranging from 0.66 to 0.96 and root-mean-square errors (RMSEs) ranging from 1.9 to 14.6 m across 33 subregions. Comparisons with other datasets demonstrate that 3D-GloBFP closely matches the distribution and spatial pattern of reference heights. Our derived 3D global building footprint map shows a distinct spatial pattern of building heights across regions, countries, and cities, with building heights gradually decreasing from the city center to the surrounding rural areas. Furthermore, our findings indicate disparities in built-up infrastructure (i.e., building volume) across different countries and cities. China is the country with the most intensive total built-up infrastructure (5.28×1011 m3, accounting for 23.9 % of the global total), followed by the USA (3.90×1011 m3, accounting for 17.6 % of the global total). Shanghai has the largest volume of built-up infrastructure (2.1×1010 m3) of all representative cities. The derived building-footprint-scale height map (3D-GloBFP) reveals the significant heterogeneity in urban built-up environments, providing valuable insights for studies on urban socioeconomic dynamics and climatology.

(1,2) Health can be envisioned as a river, with upstream, midstream, and downstream components, as well as the roots of socioeconomic factors (Figure 1). Historically, cities have focused on reactive health measures, addressing issues as they arise, yet as urbanite health is a complex interplay of social, environmental, and economic factors, there is an urgent need for a proactive approach that tackles root causes. Upstream health interventions─preventative measures focused on green infrastructure such as green and blue spaces─can significantly improve health outcomes by addressing problems before they manifest downstream. (3,4) This approach not only reduces overall health costs but also fosters sustainable, resilient urban environments. Evidence increasingly supports the efficacy and economic prudence of this upstream shift, highlighting its potential to transform urbanite health. (4−6)Figure 1Figure 1. A novel diagram to describe the ""health"" with upstream, midstream, and downstream metaphors. Ecological exposure is the amount (magnitude, frequency, and duration) of an individual or population's exposure to natural ecosystems.High Resolution ImageDownload MS PowerPoint Slide The Urgency of Upstream InterventionsUrbanites worldwide face a myriad of health challenges, from chronic diseases and mental health disorders to infectious diseases. (7) Traditional health strategies, which often focus on treating symptoms (downstream interventions), are insufficient to address these issues sustainably. Upstream interventions, aimed at improving green infrastructure, offer a more effective nature-based solution by targeting the root causes of health problems. (3,8) For instance, the World Health Organization (2021) reports that air pollution leads to 4.2 million premature deaths annually, predominantly affecting urbanites. Urban planning policies that reduce air pollution through enhanced green spaces and stricter environmental regulations can significantly mitigate these health risks. Moreover, access to green infrastructure has been shown to improve mental health, reduce stress, and lower the incidence of lifestyle-related conditions like obesity and diabetes. (3,9,10) Research indicates that urbanites with easy access to green infrastructure are more likely to engage in physical activity and experience lower stress levels, contributing to overall better health. (5,11) Economic and Social BenefitsInvesting in upstream health interventions also yields substantial economic and social benefits. Upstream preventative strategies can alleviate the burden on healthcare systems by reducing the prevalence of chronic diseases and the need for costly emergency care. Upstream interventions also promote social equity. Marginalized communities often bear the brunt of poor environmental conditions and lack of access to green infrastructure, exacerbating health disparities. Hence, inclusive urban policies─such as affordable green infrastructure and equitable access to ""nature prescription""─can enhance social cohesion and health equity by upstream means. Further evidence-based studies are needed to clarify the impact of upstream interventions on individual health outcomes and societal costs. (3) Challenges and Opportunities in Implementing Upstream StrategiesDespite the clear benefits, integrating upstream health knowledge into urban health planning presents several challenges. It requires a multidisciplinary approach that combines insights from public health, environmental science, urban planning, and social policy. Additionally, the long-term nature of upstream interventions often conflicts with the short-term focus of political cycles and budgetary constraints. Opportunities to overcome these challenges include fostering collaboration between academia, government, and the private sector. Initiatives like the Partnership for Healthy Cities, supported by Bloomberg Philanthropies, exemplify how global networks of cities can work together to implement evidence-based interventions to reduce noncommunicable diseases. A recent theoretical framework─Exposure Ecology─proposes a comprehensive understanding of the nexus between urban natural ecosystems, ecological exposure, and health, presenting an opportunity for further research and application. (3)Big data and artificial intelligence (AI) advancements also offer significant potential. By leveraging these technologies, cities can gather actionable insights and monitor the impact of interventions in real time. For example, AI can analyze urbanite health data to identify at-risk populations and tailor interventions accordingly. Community engagement is another crucial component. Policies must be culturally sensitive and responsive to the needs of diverse populations. Engaging communities in planning ensures that nature-based upstream interventions are effective and sustainable. A Call to ActionThe shift toward upstream health knowledge in health planning is both a scientific necessity and a moral imperative. As urbanization accelerates, the health of urbanites must remain a priority. Specifically, actionable upstream knowledge includes the mechanism of upstream interventions on urbanite health (microbiome), (12) the dose–response relationship and threshold of short-term and long-term health effects of greenspace exposure, (3,10) and optimal spatial patterns and inequity of greenspace exposure for urbanites. (13) The recently proposed ""3-30-300"" rule for healthier and greener cities is also a good example of actionable upstream knowledge. (14) Policymakers, urban planners, and public health professionals must embrace actionable upstream strategies to create healthier, more equitable urban environments.Author InformationClick to copy section linkSection link copied!Corresponding AuthorZhaowu Yu - Department of Environmental Science and Engineering, Fudan University, Shanghai 200438, China; https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4576-4541; Email: [email protected]AuthorsGaoyuan Yang - School of Environmental and Geographical Sciences, Shanghai Normal University, Shanghai 200234, ChinaBoyi Yang - School of Public Health, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou 510080, ChinaJun Yang - Department of Earth System Science, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084 ChinaZhuohui Zhao - Department of Environmental Health, School of Public Health, NHC Key Laboratory of Health Technology Assessment, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety of the Ministry of Education, Fudan University, Shanghai 200032, China; https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8596-0278Lan Wang - College of Architecture and Urban Planning, Tongji University, Shanghai 200092, ChinaHongxiao Liu - South China Botanical Garden, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Guangzhou 510650, ChinaJinguang Zhang - School of Landscape Architecture, Nanjing Forestry University, Nanjing 210037, ChinaBin Jiang - Faculty of Architecture, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong 999077, ChinaHenrik Vejre - Department of Geosciences and Natural Resource Management, Faculty of Science, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen 1958, DenmarkNotesThe authors declare no competing financial interest.BiographyClick to copy section linkSection link copied!Zhaowu YuHigh Resolution ImageDownload MS PowerPoint SlideZhaowu Yu, an Associate Professor and doctoral supervisor in the Department of Environmental Science and Engineering at Fudan University, mainly engages in research related to Urban Ecology, Exposure Ecology, Nature-based Solutions (NbS), and Climate Change and Remote Sensing.ReferencesClick to copy section linkSection link copied!

In international practice, Smart Village means solving the main problems facing the rural population and, more importantly, creating new economic opportunities in rural areas. “Smart village” technologies are digitization, thinking beyond the boundaries of the village, a new format of cooperation between the village and adjacent regions. We can also block the possibility of a cycle of decline by applying smart village technologies in liberated areas. Also, the use of “smart village” technologies will create conditions for the widespread dissemination of social innovations, micro and small start-up businesses among the rural population of these territories. In conclusion, smart city and smart village, the application of technology can transform the Karabakh region into a tourism pearl created by the unity of artificial intelligence and the natural beauty of the world, and at the same time an innovative start. The aim of the article is analysis and characteristics of the state concept of ""Smart city"" and ""Smart village"" as a priority of the national economy of Azerbaijan. Methods used in the study: comparative analysis, gradient, detailing and generalization, rating and grouping, etc. The hypothesis of the study. One of the current areas of scientific research is the sphere of living environment, which from the field of Smart Homes is currently developing into the field of Smart City, Smart Transport System, etc. Presentation of the main material. Currently, there is a rapid change in information and communication technologies (ICT). The emerging changes affect network technologies, computing and communication devices themselves, as well as data processing. As a result, information technologies are used in more and more areas of human life and economic life. Today, cities have become a major force in economic development and are central to production, consumption networks, defining social and economic relationships, and now provide a significant share of the gross domestic product of many countries. Cities have come to play a major role in national, regional and global development. The quality of people's lives depends on them. Therefore, today, more than ever, they are subject to special requirements, such as the availability of accessible urban infrastructure, high mobility, safety of urban areas, environmental friendliness, and developed urban self-government. For example, there is a whole direction that studies the growth of urban settlements, population concentration, and socio-economic changes. This direction is called urbanization. In 2008, the urban population was equal to the rural population. According to UN forecasts, by 2050, 85% of the population will live in cities. Thus, governments and city authorities are faced with new tasks that must not only solve a whole range of emerging problems, but also carry out a radical transformation of cities. The important point is a detailed analysis, understanding of these problems, as well as the ability to consider various solution options. All of the listed problems as a result of active urbanization are the main triggers and forced processes of urban development and their transformation into “Smart Cities”. The originality and practical significance of the study. The main goal of Smart Village projects around the world is to prevent rural-to-urban migration. In other words, conditions must be created for residents of rural areas so that all the services that people can get in the city are easily accessible in villages. At the same time, it is necessary to create more income and employment opportunities for rural residents. The third point is the creation of full-fledged conditions to ensure access of rural residents to public services. In other words, in the Smart Village concept, the difference between rural and urban areas has practically disappeared in terms of service, profit generation, and use of public services. Conclusions. According to the Smart Village concept, process electronization expands production capabilities. “Smart Village” is an automated, centrally managed and jointly managed system of the entire platform, from irrigation to tillage, harvesting, and also involves the use of the most advanced technologies and technology transfer. Integration of this system into other areas of rural infrastructure – alternative energy sources and a modern transport system - will complete the Smart Village concept.","",https://doi.org/10.32620/cher.2024.3.02,"",,
rayyan-210791302,2023: A year of success in the climate change battle or a missed opportunity?,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"From 30 November to 12 December 2023, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) 28th Conference of the Parties (COP28) was held in the United Arab Emirates. This World Climate Action Summit brought together 154 Heads of State and Government. In the very final stage of the Summit, the Parties reached several important agreements including operationalization of the loss and damage fund reinforcing the role of children and youth as agents of change through the Presidency youth climate champion, to operationalizing the transition from the fossil fuel use, emissions cuts, and scaled-up financing arrangements (United Nations COP 28, 2024). According to many observers and commentators, the agreements, which aim at more decisive climate action before the end of the decade to keep the global temperature limit of 1.5°C, imply recognition that global greenhouse gas emissions need to be cut 43% by 2030, compared to 2019 levels, to achieve that goal. This includes accelerating efforts towards the phase-down of unabated coal power, phasing out inefficient fossil fuel subsidies, and other measures that drive the transition away from fossil fuels in energy systems. The direction towards more equitable development, with developed countries continuing to take the lead, is suggested as the path to achieving those ambitious goals, and if possible, closer to 2025 (1 year from now!). Other researchers note that the urgent phasing out of fossil fuels is necessary but not sufficient. Mazzucato et al. (2023) consider that even if we could decarbonize the economy tomorrow, we would still not have a sustainable future until we take steps to maintain water systems and natural habitats. The authors argue that there is scientific evidence that ""nature loss on its own can send us crashing through the Paris climate agreement's target of limiting global warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels, ushering in a world where millions of people in vulnerable environments would no longer be able to adapt"". Further, ""(t)he increasingly well-documented links between climate change, biodiversity loss, and water insecurity point to a fundamental issue: our economic systems are based on flawed thinking. We are forever reacting to market failures when we should be pursuing proactive strategies to shape the economy for the common good"" (Ibid). We have called attention to the major connections of water with the sustainable development process and goals, from our very first Editorial in 2014 (Neto & Camkin, 2014) to the central role of water in adapting to climate change in 2023 (Camkin & Neto, 2023). Safeguarding water resources and biodiversity cannot be done without decarbonization. The unbalanced way water and its resources have been used everywhere, within a frame of uncontrolled exhaustion of the environment and the services it provides, has undoubtedly contributed to the intensification of climatic extremes. 2023 was the hottest year on record (EC, 2023), with critical rising temperatures, serious fires in many countries, and floods in many regions. In 2023, we saw how all these extremes are having an increasing impact on already vulnerable populations, and communities, making more people homeless and increasing the number of climate refugees. Amongst the gloom, there is lots of positive action. In Europe, for example, the European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS) were enforced from 1st January 2024, obligating all companies to report water risks across their operations and value chains. This mandatory reporting on water aims to help companies understand (1) the material risks and opportunities arising from their dependence on water; (2) the impacts a company's activities may have on water resources; and (3) the actions a company is taking to prevent negative impacts and contribute to broader EU water objectives (ESRS, 2023). Of course, no single action is enough to match the huge and intrinsically interconnected challenges; water-related issues can no longer be ignored in any context. The challenge is not small, or dispensable. The water cycle, its territorial links, the environment, economic uses and resources, governance—in a word—require competence and strategic vision. Both are not abundant, unfortunately, which demands multiplied efforts from the real agents for change. Given the scale of climate changes and their effects, the latest COP 28 can bring some light to the path. But it is not an entirely optimistic outlook when we look at what is effectively happening. Actors around the world cry for clearer actions for decarbonization, but sadly, many of the fossil fuel-based activities continue to be supported and strongly financed in many regions, despite the Paris Agreement and the final decisions of the Conference of the Parties in Dubai at the end of last year. As pointed out by several agencies, many countries ""are still aiming at peaking their fossil fuel use in the next years, … and countries that have ratified and agreed upon the European Union targets and the new EU Directives, still subsidize fossil fuels"" (Oikonomou, 2023). For example, in Greece, three environmental organizations have filed a formal complaint to the European Commission against Greece for systematically giving a free pass to oil and gas drilling off the Greek coasts, in breach of EU and national laws. Because COP28 was so important, we have invited Sarah Ransom, General Manager of the Australian Water Partnership, to write a Guest Editorial for this issue, entitled Returning from Dubai: Reflections on Water in the Climate Conference. Sarah provides many relevant insights into the realities of COP28, building upon her experience of also attending previous COPs. Sarah concludes that ""there is an opportunity ahead for the water community to make a significant contribution both to the fight for 1.5°C, and to ensure our skills and knowledge help communities and ecosystems to build resilience and adapt where needed, following the UN call for the water professionals to play a part on climate action in this critical decade."" The next 18 papers deal with a wide range of water issues, all linked to the need to improve the connection between research, policy, practice, and learning, particularly in the rapidly changing global context. In the paper, Is the Media Missing the Point on the Transnational American Desalination Pipe Dream? Brian F. O'Neill uses the example of large-scale seawater desalination in the southwest USA and Mexico to explore the role that media plays in the dissemination of information about globally significant transboundary issues like water policy and infrastructure projects. Drawing on experiences from Kazakhstan and elsewhere, Nurlan Apakhayev and co-authors report on their investigation into criminal offenses relating to water bodies and propose the development of new strategies and programs aimed at countering such crimes in Problems of Prevention of Criminal Offenses Related to the Use of Water Resources. Water quality management features strongly in this issue of WWP. Taking into consideration both the environmental limits specified by Egyptian legislation and industry-specific parameters, Doaa Abdou and Eid El—Ragehy propose an Industrial Water Quality Index in Unlocking Solutions for Cleaner Waters: The Industrial Wastewater Quality Index (IWQI) in Egypt and Beyond. In a book review Exploring Groundwater-Climate Change Interactions: A Critical Review of Groundwater and Climate Change: Multi-Level Law and Policy Perspectives by Philippe Cullet, Kulsum Fatima examines the key arguments presented, critically analyzing the book's contribution to the field of environmental law and policy, particularly relating to the interactions between climate change and groundwater. Returning to North America, Holly Wilts, David Burton and Aitazaz Farooque discuss the efficacy of various riparian buffer zone configurations and identify optimal buffers to protect surface water from contamination in A Comparison of Riparian Buffer Designs Incorporating Short-rotation Salix viminalis to Mitigate Surface Water Pollution in the Dunk River Watershed on Prince Edward Island. In Rainfall Extremes and Trends During the Little Dry Season in Nigeria, Joseph Omoniyi Adejuwon then presents an analysis of the ""little dry season"" in Nigeria—a dry spell amid the wet season—which is a phenomenon of interest in West Africa because of its impacts on agriculture and food production. Vishal Narain and Chanda Goodrich analyze the reasons for the limited impact of efforts for gender mainstreaming in the water sector in South Asia in their discussion paper, Glass Half Empty or Half Full? Gender in Integrated Water Resource Management in South Asia, noting that reserving seats for women in local patriarchal structures of decision-making does little to alter the status quo. Taking lessons from the experiences of riparian countries such as the Mekong River and common legal frameworks on international water law, Hoa Thanh Ha and Tuan Van Vu discuss the urgent need to establish a specialized international water management commission in their paper Urgent Call for Protection and Use of Transboundary Watercourses. Some Legal Reflections. Noting that rapid and frequent mapping of flood areas is crucial for monitoring and mitigating flood disasters, Sainath Reddy Poli and R. Bhavani's paper Assessment of Flood in Nandigama, Andhra Pradesh, Using Hydrological and Hydraulic Models reports on flood inundation mapping in Nandigama and its implications for the planning and management of flood control infrastructure. With soil erosion being a big challenge in Ethiopia due to the high expansion of agricultural activity and poor land-use management, Eyasu Tafese Mekuria's paper Sediment Yield Assessment and Suggesting Mitigation Measures: A Case Study of Deme Watershed, Omo-Gibe Basin, Ethiopia reports on sediment yield assessments and suggests mitigation measures that could reduce sediment yield by up to 90%. Amit Kumar Sharma and co-authors address the increasingly popular use of bio-indicators in water resource management in their article A Review on Plankton as a Bio-indicator: A Promising Tool for Monitoring Water Quality, highlighting recent research on the opportunities a range of planktons present for water quality management. Continuing with the water quality theme, the article Evaluating the Structures and Arrangements of Water Institutions to Include In-stream Modelling for Water Quality Management and Control Pollution: Insights from the Awash Basin, Ethiopia by Eskinder Zinabu and co-authors critically analyses existing models and the supporting environment, and suggest changes needed to improve institutional capacity. In their paper, Severity of Natural Calamities and Crop Yield Prediction Using Hybrid Deep Learning Model in Uttar Pradesh, Rajneesh Kumar and Rajendra Prasad Mahapatra discuss weaknesses in methods of predicting crop yields and propose approaches that better incorporate natural calamities such as drought, hail, and storm severity to support real-time agricultural practices and water quality protection. El Khoumsi Wafae and co-authors show that irrigation using treated wastewater generally promotes better growth in their article Effect of Treated Wastewater Irrigation on Ornamental Plants: Case Study of Lantana and Hibiscus, Morocco, highlighting the potential for a combination of treated wastewater and subsurface drip irrigation for irrigation of green spaces. Nepal has a high annual rainfall, but it still faces numerous challenges in ensuring good water quality. In the paper, An Analysis of Drinking Water Quality Parameters to Achieve Sustainable Development Goals in Rural and Urban Areas of Besisahar, Lamjung, Nepal, Mahendra Aryal reports on an analysis of 27 water samples taken from a variety of water sources with the results suggesting the need for great involvement of governments and developments in water resource management to ensure sustainability. Alebachew Shumye Moges and Sisay Assefa Wondimagegn then take us back to Ethiopia with their article, Evaluate the Effectiveness of Soil and Water Conservation Interventions in the Upper Awash Basin, Ethiopia, in which they survey community attitudes and assess the effectiveness of different conservation methods in enhancing soil physicochemical properties, reducing soil loss and erosion, and maximizing land productivity. In Assessing Groundwater Quality, Health Risks and Policy Implications: A Case Study of West Medinipur District, West Bengal, India, Md Anjar Alam, Damodhara Rao Mailapalli and Basant Maheshwari discuss the potential health risks, highlighting the complexity of groundwater quality and the need for comprehensive water policy and management strategies. Finally, Bitew K. Dessie and co-authors draw upon previous and current research to report on Pollution Challenges and Consequences of the Akaki Catchment, Upper Awash Basin, Ethiopia: Evidence for Policy Reform and Action. Finding that despite good laws and standards at federal and regional levels, environmental pollution is not being prevented because of ineffective implementation or enforcement, the authors recommend a set of specific and urgent policy measures. Thank you to all our authors and to the numerous reviewers who volunteered their time to support this issue of World Water Policy. We trust you will enjoy reading this rich collection of insights from around the world into water policy, practice, and the learning that supports them. We look forward to your contributions in the future. Our best wishes Susana Neto, Jeff Camkin 2023年11月30日至12月12日, 联合国气候变化框架公约(UNFCCC)第二十八次缔约方大会(COP28)在阿联酋举行, 本届世界气候行动峰会汇聚了154位国家元首和政府首脑。在峰会的最后阶段, 各方达成了几项重要协议, 包括""损失和损害""基金的操作化, 通过主席团青年气候倡导者加强儿童和青少年作为变革推动者的作用, 以及对""化石燃料使用的过渡 、减排和融资安排扩大""的操作化。 许多观察者和评论员认为, 这些协议(旨在于2030年之前采取更果断的气候行动, 以期将全球气温上升限制在1.5度以内)意味着对一个观点的认可, 即与 2019 年的水平相比, 2030年全球温室气体排放量需要减少43%才能实现这一目标。这包括加快逐步淘汰有增无减的煤电、逐步取消低效的化石燃料补贴, 以及加快一系列在能源系统中推动化石燃料转型的其他措施。建议以""发达国家继续带头的更加公平的发展方向""作为实现这些宏伟目标的路径, 如果可能的话, 在更接近2025年的时间内完成这些目标(即一年后!)。 其他研究人员指出, 紧急逐步淘汰化石燃料是必要的, 但还不够。Mazzucato等人(2023)认为, 即使我们明天就能实现经济脱碳, 但除非我们采取措施维护水系统和自然栖息地, 否则我们仍然不会拥有可持续的未来。作者论证, 有科学证据表明, ""自然损失本身就可能使我们无法实现巴黎气候协议的目标(即将全球变暖限制在比工业化前水平高1.5°C的范围内), 从而导致数百万生活在脆弱环境中的人将无法再适应""。此外, ""气候变化、生物多样性丧失和水不安全之间越来越明显的联系指出了一个根本问题:我们的经济系统建立在有缺陷的思维之上。当我们应该采取积极主动的战略来塑造经济以实现共同利益时, 我们却一直只对市场失灵作出反应""(同上)。 从 2014 年第一篇社论(Neto & Camkin, 2014)到 2023 年水在气候变化适应中的核心作用(Camkin & Neto, 2023), 我们一直呼吁人们关注水与可持续发展过程及目标的主要联系。如果没有脱碳, 就无法保护水资源和生物多样性。在环境及其提供的服务不受控制地枯竭的框架下, 各地对水及水资源的使用方式不平衡, 这无疑加剧了极端气候。2023年是有史以来最热的一年, 气温急剧上升, 许多国家发生严重火灾, 许多地区发生洪水。2023年, 我们看到所有这些极端情况如何对本已脆弱的人群和社区产生越来越大的影响, 使更多人无家可归, 并增加气候难民的数量。 这一困难下也出现了许多积极行动。例如, 在欧洲, 《欧洲可持续发展报告标准》(ESRS)自2024年1月1日起强制执行, 要求所有公司报告其运营和价值链中的水风险。这项关于水的强制性报告旨在帮助企业理解(1)由于对水的依赖而产生的重大风险和机遇;(2)公司的活动可能对水资源造成的影响;(3)公司为防止负面影响并促进更广泛的欧盟水目标而采取的行动(ESRS 2023)。 当然, 任何单一行动都不足以应对巨大且内在相互关联的挑战;在任何情况下都不能再忽视与水有关的问题。挑战不小, 并且是必要的。水循环、其领土联系、环境、经济用途和资源、治理——总而言之——需要能力和战略眼光。不幸的是, 能力和战略眼光都不充足, 这要求真正的变革行动者付出加倍的努力。 考虑到气候变化的规模及其影响, 最新的COP 28能为道路带来一丝曙光。但当我们审视正在发生的事情时, 这并不是一个完全乐观的前景。世界各地的行动者呼吁采取更明确的脱碳行动, 但遗憾的是, 尽管《巴黎协定》和去年底迪拜COP大会作出了最终决策, 许多地区仍继续支持和大力资助以化石燃料为基础的诸多活动。正如一些机构指出的那样, 许多国家""仍致力于在未来几年达到化石燃料使用的峰值……而已经批准并同意欧盟目标和新欧盟指令的国家仍然对化石燃料提供补贴""(Oikonomou, 2023)。例如, 在希腊, 三个环保组织已向欧盟委员会提出正式投诉, 指控希腊系统性地为希腊海岸附近的石油天然气钻探提供免费通行证, 违反了欧盟和国家法律。 由于COP28如此重要, 我们邀请了澳大利亚水伙伴关系总经理Sarah Ransom为本期撰写一篇客座社论, 题为《从迪拜归来:气候会议中对水的反思》。Sarah基于她参加过往COP大会的经历, 对COP28的现实情况提供了许多相关见解。Sarah总结道:""水社区有机会在两方面作出重大贡献, 第一, 通过快速发展的举措量化其对气候缓解的贡献, 并支持能源转型, 将全球变暖控制在1.5度内(UN Water, 2023), 第二, 确保我们的技能和知识帮助社区和生态系统建立复原力并在需要时进行适应。"" 接下来的18篇论文涉及广泛的水问题, 它们都与""改善研究、政策、实践和学习之间的联系""这一需求有关, 特别是在快速变化的全球情境下。 在《媒体是否没有真正理解美国的跨国海水淡化厂白日梦?》这篇论文中, Brian F. O'Neill以美国西南部和墨西哥的大规模海水淡化为例, 探究了媒体在传播""水政策和基础设施项目等全球重大跨边界问题""信息中所发挥的作用。在《与水资源利用相关的刑事犯罪预防问题》一文中, Nurlan Apakhayev和合著者借鉴哈萨克斯坦和其他地方的经验, 报告了他们对与水体有关的刑事犯罪的调查情况, 并提出制定一系列旨在打击此类犯罪的新战略和项目。水质管理是本期《全球水政策》(WWP)的重点内容。考虑到埃及立法规定的环境限制和行业特定参数, Doaa Abdou和Eid El–Ragehy在《解锁清洁水源的解决方案:埃及及其他地区的工业废水质量指数(IWQI)》一文中提出了一项工业水质指数。在题为《探究地下水与气候变化的相互作用:关于Philippe Cullet所著的⟨地下水与气候变化:多层次法律与政策视角⟩的批判性评论》的书评中, Kulsum Fatima分析了所提出的关键论点, 批判分析了该书对环境法和政策领域的贡献, 特别是与""气候变化和地下水之间的相互作用""有关的方面。 将焦点转回到北美, Holly Wilts、David Burton和Aitazaz Farooque在《结合短期轮作蒿柳的河岸缓冲区设计比较:缓解爱德华王子岛Dunk河流域的地表水污染》一文中探讨了不同河岸缓冲区配置的效能, 并识别了保护地表水免受污染的最佳缓冲区。在《尼日利亚小旱季期间的极端降雨和趋势》一文中, Joseph Omoniyi Adejuwon对尼日利亚的""小旱季""(雨季中的旱季)进行了分析, 这在西非是一种有趣的现象, 因为其对农业和粮食生产造成了影响。Vishal Narain和Chanda Goodrich在题为《玻璃杯是半空还是半满?南亚水资源综合管理中的性别问题》的讨论文中分析了南亚水务部门性别主流化举措影响力有限的原因, 指出了在地方父权式决策结构中为妇女保留席位一事对于改变现状几乎没有作用。 借鉴湄公河等沿岸国家的经验以及国际水法的共同立法框架, Hoa Thanh Ha和Tuan Van Vu在其论文《迫切呼吁对跨边界水道的保护和利用:一些立法反思》中讨论了""建立专门的国际水管理委员会""这一迫切需要。通过指出快速且频繁的洪水区制图对于监测和减轻洪水灾害而言至关重要, Sainath Reddy Poli和R. Bhavani在题为《安得拉邦 Nandigama 区域的洪水评估:使用水文和水力模型》的论文中报告了Nandigama洪水淹没制图及其对""规划和管理防洪基础设施""的启示。由于农业活动的高度扩张和土地使用管理不善, 土壤侵蚀成为埃塞俄比亚的一大挑战, 鉴于此, Eyasu Tafese Mekuria的论文《沉积物产量评估和缓解措施建议:埃塞俄比亚奥莫-吉贝盆地Deme流域案例研究》报告了沉积物产量评估并提出了一系列可将沉积物产量减少高达90%的缓解措施。 Amit Kumar Sharma和合著者在题为《关于浮游生物作为生物指示剂的述评:一项监测水质的有用工具》的文章中研究了生物指示剂在水资源管理中越来越多的使用, 并强调了关于一系列浮游生物为水质管理提供机遇的近期研究。继续围绕水质主题, Eskinder Zinabu及其合著者撰写的《评估水机构的结构和安排, 以提出用于水质管理和污染控制的河道内建模:来自埃塞俄比亚阿瓦什流域的见解》一文批判性分析了现有模型和支持环境, 并提出""提高机构能力""一事所需的变革。Rajneesh Kumar和Rajendra Prasad Mahapatra在其论文《使用混合深度学习模型预测北方邦自然灾害的严重程度和作物产量》中探讨了作物产量预测方法的缺点, 并提出了一系列用于更好地结合自然灾害(干旱、冰雹)与风暴严重程度的方法, 以支持实时农业实践与水质保护。El Khoumsi Wafae和合著者在其文章《处理后的废水灌溉对观赏植物的影响:以摩洛哥的马缨丹和朱槿为例》中表明, 使用处理过的废水进行灌溉通常会促进更好的生长, 强调了处理过的废水和地下滴灌相结合的潜力, 以用于绿地灌溉。 尼泊尔年降雨量高, 但在确保良好水质方面仍面临诸多挑战。在题为《分析尼泊尔拉姆琼贝西萨哈农村和城市地区的饮用水质参数, 以实现可持续发展目标》的论文中, Mahendra Aryal报告了一项对""来自不同水源的27个水样""的分析, 结果表明, 需要政府大力参与水资源管理和一系列发展, 以确保可持续性。Alebachew Shumye Moges和Sisay Assefa Wondimagegn将我们带回埃塞俄比亚, 他们的文章题为《评价埃塞俄比亚上阿瓦什盆地水土保持干预措施的有效性》。文章调查了社区态度并评估了不同保护方法在增强土壤理化特性、减少水土流失和侵蚀、以及最大限度提高土地生产力方面的有效性。在《评估地下水质、健康风险和政策启示:印度西孟加拉邦西梅迪尼布尔县案例研究》一文中, Md Anjar Alam、Damodhara Rao Mailapalli和Basant Maheshwari探讨了潜在的健康风险, 强调了地下水质的复杂性以及""全面的水政策和管理战略""的必要性。最后, Bitew K. Dessie和合著者在《埃塞俄比亚上阿瓦什盆地阿卡基流域的污染挑战和结果:政策改革与行动的证据》一文中对以往和当前的研究进行了报告。作者发现, 尽管联邦和地区层面有良好的法律和标准, 但由于实施或执行不力, 环境污染并未得到预防, 因此建议采取一套具体而紧急的政策措施。 感谢我们所有的作者以及众多自愿花时间支持本期《世界水政策》的审稿人。我们相信您会享受阅读本期内容, 受益于来自世界各地的、""关于水政策、实践以及支持它们的学习""的丰富见解。. 我们期待您的投稿。 献上最美好的祝愿 Susana Neto, Jeff Camkin 关键词 气候变化, COP 28, 水质, 水政策与实践, 水资源综合管理, 水政策. Del 30 de noviembre al 12 de diciembre de 2023 se celebró en los Emiratos Árabes Unidos la 28 Conferencia de las Partes (COP28) de la Convención Marco de las Naciones Unidas sobre el Cambio Climático (CMNUCC), esta Cumbre Mundial sobre Acción Climática reunió a 154 Jefes de Estado y de Gobierno. En la etapa final de la Cumbre, las Partes alcanzaron varios acuerdos importantes, incluida la puesta en funcionamiento del fondo para pérdidas y daños, que refuerza el papel de los niños y los jóvenes como agentes de cambio a través del liderazgo juvenil climático de la Presidencia, hasta la puesta en práctica de la transición desde el uso de combustibles fósiles, recortes de emisiones y acuerdos de financiación ampliados. Según muchos observadores y comentaristas, los acuerdos, que apuntan a una acción climática más decisiva antes del final de la década para mantener el límite de temperatura global de 1,5°C, implican el reconocimiento de que las emisiones globales de gases de efecto invernadero deben reducirse en un 43% para 2030. en comparación con los niveles de 2019, para lograr ese objetivo. Esto incluye acelerar los esfuerzos hacia la reducción gradual de la energía a base de carbón, eliminar gradualmente los subsidios ineficientes a los combustibles fósiles y otras medidas que impulsen la transición para alejarse de los combustibles fósiles en los sistemas energéticos. Se sugiere que la dirección hacia un desarrollo más equitativo, en el que los países desarrollados sigan a la cabeza, es el camino para alcanzar esos ambiciosos objetivos y, si es posible, más cerca de 2025 (¡dentro de un año!). Otros investigadores señalan que la urgente eliminación gradual de los combustibles fósiles es necesaria pero no suficiente. Mazzucato et al. (2023) consideran que incluso si pudiéramos descarbonizar la economía mañana, todavía no tendríamos un futuro sostenible hasta que tomemos medidas para mantener los sistemas hídricos y los hábitats naturales. Los autores sostienen que existe evidencia científica de que ""la pérdida de naturaleza por sí sola puede hacernos fracasar en el objetivo del acuerdo climático de París de limitar el calentamiento global a 1,5°C por encima de los niveles preindustriales, marcando el comienzo de un mundo donde millones de personas en entornos vulnerables ya no podría adaptarse"". Además, ""los vínculos cada vez más documentados entre el cambio climático, la pérdida de biodiversidad y la inseguridad hídrica apuntan a una cuestión fundamental: nuestros sistemas económicos se basan en un pensamiento erróneo. Siempre estamos reaccionando a las fallas del mercado cuando deberíamos buscar estrategias proactivas para configurar la economía para el bien común"" (Ibid). Hemos llamado la atención sobre las principales conexiones del agua con el proceso y los objetivos de desarrollo sostenible, desde nuestro primer editorial en 2014 (Neto y Camkin, 2014) hasta el papel central del agua en la adaptación al cambio climático en 2023 (Camkin & Neto, 2023). La salvaguardia de los recursos hídricos y la biodiversidad no se puede lograr sin la descarbonización. El uso desequilibrado del agua y sus recursos en todas partes, en un marco de agotamiento incontrolado del medio ambiente y de los servicios que éste proporciona, ha contribuido sin duda a la intensificación de los extremos climáticos. 2023 fue el año más caluroso jamás registrado (CE, 2023), con un aumento crítico de las temperaturas, incendios graves en muchos países e inundaciones en muchas regiones. En 2023 vimos cómo todos estos extremos están teniendo un impacto cada vez mayor en poblaciones y comunidades que ya son vulnerables, dejando a más personas sin hogar y aumentando el número de refugiados climáticos. En medio de la oscuridad hay muchas acciones positivas. En Europa, por ejemplo, los Estándares Europeos de Informes de Sostenibilidad (ESRS) se aplicaron a partir del 1 de enero de 2024, lo que obliga a todas las empresas a informar los riesgos hídricos en sus operaciones y cadenas de valor. Este informe obligatorio sobre el agua tiene como objetivo ayudar a las empresas a comprender (1) los riesgos y oportunidades materiales que surgen de su dependencia del agua; (2) los impactos que las actividades de una empresa pueden tener en los recursos hídricos; y (3) las acciones que una empresa está tomando para prevenir impactos negativos y contribuir a los objetivos hídricos más amplios de la UE (ESRS 2023). Por supuesto, ninguna acción por sí sola es suficiente para hacer frente a los enormes desafíos intrínsecamente interconectados; Las cuestiones relacionadas con el agua ya no pueden ignorarse en ningún contexto. El desafío no es pequeño ni prescindible. El ciclo del agua, sus vínculos territoriales, el medio ambiente, los usos y recursos económicos, la gobernanza -en una palabra- requieren competencia y visión estratégica. Desafortunadamente, ambos no abundan, lo que exige esfuerzos multiplicados por parte de los verdaderos agentes del cambio. Dada la escala de los cambios climáticos y sus efectos, la última COP 28 puede arrojar algo de luz sobre el camino. Pero no es una perspectiva enteramente optimista cuando analizamos lo que efectivamente está sucediendo. Los actores de todo el mundo claman por acciones más claras para la descarbonización pero, lamentablemente, muchas de las actividades basadas en combustibles fósiles siguen siendo apoyadas y fuertemente financiadas en muchas regiones, a pesar del Acuerdo de París y las decisiones finales de la Conferencia de las Partes en Dubai en finales del año pasado. Como lo señalaron varias agencias, muchos países ""todavía apuntan a alcanzar el máximo uso de combustibles fósiles en los próximos años … y los países que han ratificado y acordado los objetivos de la Unión Europea y las nuevas directivas de la UE, todavía subsidian los combustibles fósiles"". (Oikonomou, 2023). Por ejemplo, en Grecia, tres organizaciones ambientalistas han presentado una queja formal ante la Comisión Europea contra Grecia por dar sistemáticamente vía libre a las perforaciones de petróleo y gas frente a las costas griegas, en violación de las leyes nacionales y de la UE. Debido a que la COP28 fue tan importante, invitamos a Sarah Ransom, Gerente General de Australian Water Partnership, a escribir un editorial invitado para esta edición, titulado Regresando de Dubai: Reflexiones sobre el agua en la Conferencia sobre el Clima. Sarah brinda muchas ideas relevantes sobre las realidades de la COP28, basándose en su experiencia de haber asistido también a COP anteriores. Sarah concluye que ""hay una oportunidad por delante para que la comunidad del agua haga una contribución significativa tanto a la lucha por los 1,5º C como para garantizar que nuestras habilidades y conocimientos ayuden a las comunidades y los ecosistemas a desarrollar resiliencia y adaptarse donde sea necesario, siguiendo el llamado de la ONU. que los profesionales del agua desempeñen un papel en la acción climática en esta década crítica"". Los siguientes 18 artículos abordan una amplia gama de cuestiones relacionadas con el agua, todas ellas vinculadas a la necesidad de mejorar la conexión entre la investigación, las políticas, la práctica y el aprendizaje, particularmente en el contexto global que cambia rápidamente. En el artículo, ¿Los medios no entienden la quimera transnacional estadounidense de la desalinización? Brian F. O'Neill utiliza el ejemplo de la desalinización de agua de mar a gran escala en el suroeste de Estados Unidos y México para explorar el papel que desempeñan los medios en la difusión de información sobre cuestiones transfronterizas de importancia mundial, como las políticas hídricas y los proyectos de infraestructura. Basándose en experiencias de Kazajstán y otros lugares, Nurlan Apakhayev y sus coautores informan sobre su investigación sobre delitos penales relacionados con masas de agua y proponen el desarrollo de nuevas estrategias y programas destinados a contrarrestar dichos delitos en Problemas de prevención de delitos penales relacionados con el uso. de Recursos Hídricos. La gestión de la calidad del agua ocupa un lugar destacado en este número de WWP. Teniendo en cuenta tanto los límites ambientales especificados por la legislación egipcia como los parámetros específicos de la industria, Doaa Abdou y Eid El—Ragehy proponen un índice de calidad del agua industrial para desbloquear soluciones para aguas más limpias: el índice de calidad de las aguas residuales industriales (IWQI) en Egipto y más allá. En una reseña del libro ""Exploring Groundwater-Climate Change Interactions: A Critical Review of Groundwater and Climate Change: Multi-Level Law and Policy Perspectives"" de Philippe Cullet, Kulsum Fatima examina los argumentos clave presentados, analizando críticamente la contribución del libro al campo del medio ambiente. Leyes y políticas, particularmente en relación con las interacciones entre el cambio climático y las aguas subterráneas.

rayyan-210791307,Empowering communities: The role of wearable devices in environmental justice ,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Department of Built Environment and Environmental Health and Disease Laboratory, North Carolina A&T State University, Greensboro, North Carolina, United States of America Abstract: This paper delves into the emerging role of wearable devices in the realm of environmental justice and public health monitoring, offering a novel perspective on how technology can empower communities, especially those facing disproportionate environmental challenges. It provides an in-depth analysis of various wearable sensor technologies, including air quality monitors, UV exposure sensors, and water quality sensors, highlighting their significance in real-time environmental and health data collection. The research underscores the importance of these devices in enabling marginalized communities to actively participate in monitoring and responding to environmental health hazards. By facilitating access to personalized and location-specific environmental data, wearable technologies not only raise individual awareness but also contribute to community-level advocacy and action. Furthermore, the paper explores the potential advancements in wearable technologies through the integration of AI and machine learning, enhancing their effectiveness in data analysis and interpretation. However, it also critically examines the challenges associated with data privacy, security, and accessibility, emphasizing the need for inclusive and equitable technology deployment. This study is significant for its contribution to understanding the intersection of technology, environmental health, and social justice.

Email: eobenggyasi@ncat.edu; IntroductionEnvironmental justice (EJ) is defined by the US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) as the equitable treatment and meaningful involvement of all individuals, irrespective of ""race, color, national origin, or income, in the development, implementation, and enforcement of environmental laws, regulations, and policies"" (1).EJ studies scholar Robert Bullard defines environmental justice as a principle of ""equal protection and equal enforcement of our environmental, health, housing, land use, transportation, energy, and civil rights laws and regulation"" (2).EJ means every individual should be protected, and no group should be disadvantaged or suffer the impact of environmental issues. Individuals, whether majority, minority, rich or poor should have the opportunity to live in a clean and unpolluted environment. EJ is not only about protecting the population from environmental conditions but also about creating a clean and safe environment for individuals to thrive and enjoy a good life.The EJ movement is often recognized as having its roots in the 1982 Warren County protest in North Carolina. This significant event marked a pivotal moment in civil rights and environmental activism, as it brought together a diverse coalition of residents, civil rights activists, and political leaders. They united in response to the proposed construction of a landfill site for the disposal of soil contaminated with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), a group of highly toxic chemicals. This proposal came after the discovery that over 32,000 cubic yards of PCB-contaminated soil had been illegally dumped along roadways in fourteen North Carolina counties in 1978. The protest in Warren County, a community significantly impacted by these actions, stands as a landmark event in the ongoing struggle for environmental justice and equity, highlighting the intersection of racial, social, and environmental issues (3).Even though the protest in Warren County did not ultimately prevent the disposal of PCBs in the area, it nevertheless succeeded in raising the issue of environmental justice to national and international prominence (4). This movement was crucial in spotlighting environmental injustices, particularly how they disproportionately affect marginalized communities in the United States. Following the protest, there was a heightened governmental and scholarly focus on understanding and addressing environmental disparities. This increased attention led to extensive research into the patterns, impacts, and potential solutions for environmental inequities, especially in historically underserved areas.Research findings over the years have consistently highlighted a troubling trend: communities with predominantly African American populations and those of lower socio-economic status were more likely to be selected for the disposal of hazardous waste. This practice not only posed severe environmental risks but also had significant health implications for the residents of these areas. The Warren County protest thus stands as a landmark event in the ongoing efforts to achieve environmental justice and equality, shedding light on the intersection of environmental issues with racial and socio-economic factors (5). This recognition further emphasized the need for comprehensive action to rectify these injustices.Numerous essential research studies have outlined that individuals from marginalized communities, including people of color, those with lower socioeconomic status, indigenous and immigrant populations, are disproportionately impacted by environmentally harmful infrastructures. These infrastructures include landfills, mines, incinerators, polluting factories, and disruptive transportation systems. Additionally, these communities bear a higher burden of negative consequences stemming from ecologically harmful practices, such as climate change/disruption and pesticide exposure (6).Inhabitants of marginalized communities face the dire consequences of environmental injustice, primarily due to their limited access to costly, advanced tools for assessing environmental pollutants. Furthermore, their reliance on governmental authorities to gauge pollution levels often results in agonizingly slow responses (7). State-provided environmental monitoring methods, including air and water quality assessments, soil sampling, and noise pollution evaluations, can be resource-intensive and often inefficient in timely service delivery to impacted communities. It is increasingly critical for residents in marginalized areas to adopt cost-effective, personal monitoring tools to assess environmental pollution levels. This approach not only facilitates a more direct understanding of pollution's impact but also empowers these communities to advocate effectively against detrimental environmental decisions.Wearable environmental monitoring devices can offer a practical solution, particularly for residents in underserved communities. These devices are capable of tracking a range of environmental parameters, such as air quality, temperature, and humidity, directly in the wearer's immediate surroundings. By employing these tools, individuals can obtain real-time data on the extent of environmental pollution, providing a basis for informed community action.This strategy represents a shift from relying solely on traditional, often costly, state-managed monitoring methods. By pooling resources, communities can collectively invest in these wearable devices, thereby enhancing their capacity to independently monitor and respond to environmental challenges, fostering a more sustainable and healthy living environment. Wearable devices: A potential solution for environmental monitoringWearables, defined as compact electronic devices or wireless-enabled computers seamlessly integrated into everyday accessories, clothing, or gadgets, provide a valuable avenue for marginalized communities to manage their environmental health actively. Some iterations of these wearables, like micro-chips or smart tattoos, represent more invasive options. These wearable technologies are primarily designed for collecting, transmitting, and analyzing data typically gathered from human or animal bodies. They can encompass purely mechanical devices or sophisticated mechatronic systems, skillfully constructed using a combination of sensors, actuators, and computational components (8).As per Gao et al (9) wearable electronics refer to devices designed to be worn or attached to human skin for the continuous and close monitoring of an individual's activities, without causing interruption or restriction to the user's movements. Building on this definition, wearables can be succinctly described as electronic devices that are worn as accessories on the human body. They are equipped with integrated sensors to continuously track and display various personal metrics. These metrics often include daily physical activity, heart rate, and sleep patterns, monitored in real time. Common examples of such devices encompass smartwatches, smart glasses, wearable cameras, and virtual reality headsets. Each of these wearables offers unique functionalities and contributes to the growing utility of personal electronic monitoring in everyday life. Compared to conventional devices, these flexible electronic devices are low in cost and power efficient in their consumption, allowing uninterrupted data acquisition over a long time (10). Wearable devices are on high demand because of its numerous advantages in health care monitoring, environmental and noise pollution, entertainment, communication, and many others. Also, due to their cost-effectiveness, wearable devices can serve as a means for marginalized communities to monitor their environment and assess the impact of pollution on their lives. This approach empowers them to resist decisions that affect their health and environment. By narrowing down the specific details and insights collected through these devices, individuals or communities invested in environmental health are better prepared to address concerns in both practical and political contexts (11). Types of wearable devices The surge in demand for wearable devices can be attributed to their multifaceted functionalities, applicable across various personal and industrial domains. Prominent examples of wearables include smartphones, smartwatches, fitness trackers, and smart glasses, each offering a unique set of features. Smartphones, primarily serving as communication tools through text messages and voice calls, also host a plethora of applications for mapping, weather forecasting, and monitoring daily steps and heart rate.Smartwatches go beyond merely displaying time; they are instrumental in tracking overall wellness by monitoring daily movements, heart rate, blood pressure, and body temperature, among other metrics. Similarly, fitness trackers are not just limited to counting daily steps and distance traveled. They offer a comprehensive view of one's health by tracking sleep patterns, calculating total daily calorie burn, and continuously monitoring heart rate, thus contributing significantly to the personalized health monitoring landscape. Other smart device Smart glasses: Wearable devices equipped with features beyond traditional eyewear. These glasses typically incorporate a small computer or display module, enabling them to provide information directly to the wearer. The recording and shooting functions of smart glasses may violate others' privacy. However, as long as the purpose is clear and the monitor system is perfect, smart glasses will not become a threat to privacy but a practical life assistant and medical tool. Google, for example, already plans to introduce contact lenses with built-in sensors that can detect users' blood sugar levels.Smart clothes and socks smart clothes: They collect body data from users through fabric sensors and collection devices, which can be used to monitor users' exercise data and heat consumption. Also, there are smart baby clothes for infants to monitor their physical condition. Smart shoes: Smart sneakers mainly collect users' sports data to help users improve their sports plans better. In addition, some smart sneakers have new motion detection functions, such as Nike's FuelBand SE, which reminds users to stand up and take a move once in a while. Smart earphones: Smart headphones have new methods of applications, such as intelligent voice analysis and processing, which allow users to operate the equipment more conveniently using voice commands. In the future, it may be possible to integrate sensors directly into in-ear headphones to monitor heart rate, body temperature, and movement (12) Evaluating health risks linked to toxic exposure remains a formidable challenge in the realm of environmental justice. Established connections between specific chemical exposures and certain health conditions are well-documented. However, quantifying exposure levels—including the concentration, duration, and appropriate measurement methods—continues to be a contentious and complex task. This complexity is further amplified by the difficulty of distinguishing these exposures from other concurrent environmental factors (13,14). In the context of environmental justice and the potential role of wearable devices, it's crucial to understand the concept of marginalized communities and the root causes of disparities and inequalities in our society. Marginalization refers to a systematic process in which specific groups are excluded or pushed to the fringe of political and socioeconomic spheres. This relegation is often based on factors such as race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, geographical location, religion, language, sexual identity, and disability status. Understanding this framework is essential for addressing and mitigating the environmental injustices these communities face (15). Causes of disparity in marginalized communitiesA striking example of systemic disparity can be seen in a 1984 report by Cerrell Associates, commissioned by the California Waste Management Board. This report candidly advised both industry and state authorities to strategically site waste incinerators in neighborhoods characterized by ""lower socioeconomic"" status. The rationale behind this recommendation was grounded in the perception that these communities would present a significantly reduced likelihood of political opposition, highlighting a calculated approach to exploiting socioeconomic vulnerabilities (16).In a 1996 paper, Heiman and colleagues (17) discussed a notable example of environmental disparity. Their research revealed the existence of a major commercial hazardous waste management site at a landfill in Adams County, Colorado, and an incinerator in East Liverpool, Ohio. Both of these facilities were located in areas with predominantly Caucasian populations. In a striking contrast, the paper identified that three of the largest hazardous waste landfills, which accounted for over forty percent of the nation's total permitted commercial capacity for hazardous waste, were situated exclusively within two African-American communities (Emelle, Alabama, and Alsen, Louisiana) and one Hispanic community (Kettleman City, California). Remarkably, Kettleman City did not have its own waste management facility. This situation underscored a concerning pattern in environmental justice, highlighting how communities of color were disproportionately impacted by the placement of hazardous waste facilities (17).Communities that have been historically marginalized continue to grapple with the stark realities of environmental injustice. These groups, frequently facing discrimination due to factors like race, economic status, gender, or disabilities, are often deprived of essential societal benefits and opportunities. This disparity is evident in their lack of access to adequate healthcare, education, and sanitation infrastructure, among other basic necessities (6). Significantly, Black communities and those living in lower socioeconomic conditions are the most vulnerable to environmental hazards, including air, water, soil, and noise pollution. The deep-seated causes of these environmental injustices are multifaceted and complex, as discussed in the following sections. Historical inequities Throughout American history, Black communities have faced persistent marginalization, a legacy that originates from the country's foundational years and its intricate history with slavery. The systemic racism, economic inequalities, and societal disparities that continue to impact Black communities today are deeply rooted in this period, where slavery was an entrenched institution in American society (18).The legacy of slavery left an indelible mark on the development of the United States. Black people were subjected to unimaginable discrimination and the denial of fundamental rights. This tragic history laid the groundwork for the systemic racism that persists in various forms. Economic disparities have persisted as a consequence of centuries of unequal treatment, with Black individuals being deprived of opportunities and resources (19).These historic injustices have contributed to a stark contrast in the exposure and health outcomes of Black communities when compared to other racial groups. The consequences of this deep-seated discrimination continue to be felt today, underscoring the need for ongoing efforts to address and rectify these disparities (20). In the history of the United States, minority communities have endured subpar educational systems, with even those fortunate enough to attend schools often facing bullying and discrimination based on their racial background. This unfortunate reality has led to a significant number of students dropping out of school, contributing to increased crime rates within these communities (21). These historical disadvantages have persisted over time, exacerbating the divide between marginalized communities and the rest of society, thus perpetuating social and economic disparities.The roots of this systemic racism trace back to the country's early history. It began when enslaved Black individuals were denied basic human rights and were counted as only three-fifths of a person for the purpose of determining state representation in Congress. Even after the Emancipation Proclamation and the conclusion of the American Civil War, Black Americans still faced harsh restrictions through the imposition of Black Codes, which limited freedoms and compelled many to work for minimal or no wages (22).The Civil Rights Act of 1866 was a landmark piece of legislation in the United States that affirmed the rights of Black people, particularly in matters related to property, labor, and contracts. However, it did not address voting rights or the ability to hold political office, which were issues later tackled by the 15th Amendment in 1870, granting Black men the right to vote. During the subsequent Jim Crow era, a range of segregationist policies were implemented, which had profound and lasting effects on the Black community. These policies entrenched poverty and denied Black Americans numerous economic and educational opportunities. Furthermore, in the 1930s, the discriminatory practice of redlining was instituted. This practice, carried out by federal housing agencies and private lenders, systematically denied financial services such as mortgages and insurance to residents in certain areas, predominantly those with a high concentration of Black residents. The impact of redlining was severe – it led to a decrease in property values in these areas, a deterioration in the quality of local schools and stores, and limited access to equitable healthcare, further exacerbating the socioeconomic challenges faced by the Black community (18).Historically, communities of color in the United States have faced significant challenges in accessing their voting rights. These challenges were often rooted in systemic racism, which played a primary role in creating disparities in voter suppression. Various policies and practices, such as literacy tests, poll taxes, and other discriminatory measures, were explicitly designed to limit the voting rights of these communities. In contemporary times, there are concerns that certain policies and practices may continue to limit ballot access for communities of color. This includes issues like strict voter ID laws, reduction of early voting periods, and the closure of polling places in predominantly minority neighborhoods. Additionally, there is the phenomenon of survey misreporting. This occurs when voter turnout among communities of color is inaccurately reported in surveys, often showing higher rates of participation than actually occur. This misreporting can have significant implications. It may lead to a misunderstanding of the true extent of voter suppression and could potentially influence the development of policies and practices that inadvertently or deliberately continue to suppress the vote among these groups (23).A system of racial segregation and discrimination, known as Jim Crow laws, was prevalent in the United States from the late 1800s to the mid-1960s. These laws, enacted by state and local governments, enforced racial segregation in public places, including schools, housing, and transportation. The Jim Crow era also extended to voting, employment, and other areas of life, systematically marginalizing African Americans. During this period, African Americans were systematically denied the right to vote through various means. These included literacy tests, poll taxes, and violent intimidation, all designed to disenfranchise them. These tactics effectively prevented African Americans from exercising their voting rights, which in turn allowed White politicians to maintain power and control over political and social institutions. The impact of these discriminatory practices contributed to the perpetuation of racial disparities and injustices that echoed into contemporary times, influencing policies and practices related to voting rights (24). Zoning and land use policiesIn their 1993 study, Massey and Denton (25) discussed how historical discrimination, ongoing inequality, and specific policies have contributed to racial segregation in housing in the United States. They highlight practices such as redlining, discriminatory lending, and exclusionary zoning as key factors. Their argument posits that 'systemic racism', rather than just individual preferences or market dynamics, plays a crucial role in creating disparities in housing access and quality for racial minorities. However, it's important to acknowledge that housing challenges are not exclusive to any single racial group. People living in poverty, irrespective of their race, often face significant difficulties related to housing. These include living in inadequate or unsafe conditions, struggling with high housing costs relative to their income, and facing the risk of homelessness. This broader perspective recognizes that while systemic racism significantly affects housing disparities, economic factors also play a critical role in housing challenges experienced by people across different communities (25).Poor communities are often situated in areas that are redlined with less stringent zoning regulation making it easier for industries to locate there. The areas are marked as high risk, the people in such communities are denied financial services such as mortgages or loans to improve their lives. Also, because of the segregation the land regulations in these communities are not enforced to protect the people and the environment from pollution. Poor communities have become the dumping sites for most industrial toxic waste, landfill sites where garbage with different toxic contaminants are sited, waste incinerators which produce harmful chemicals to the environment are also found in these communities. These pollutants contaminate the air, soil and nearby water bodies.This results in higher exposure to environmental hazards as the communities' experience air pollution by inhaling harmful gases which can lead to respiratory diseases. Their water is also polluted and by consuming the contaminated water many are at risk of suffering from waterborne diseases. The noise and chemicals from the industrialized factories set up in their locality adversely affect the people and environment. All this leads to the inhabitants of such communities being at higher risk of being diagnosed with respiratory diseases, lead and other contaminant poisoning, skin cancer, lung cancer, neurological issues, and cardiovascular diseases. Economic factorsOliver and Shapiro (26) asserted that 'systemic racism' is a primary driver of disparities in the wealth gap. They argue that the wealth gap between Black and White Americans is not simply the result of individual differences in savings or investment behavior but rather is the product of historical discrimination and inequality. They claim past policies such as redlining, discriminatory lending practices, and discriminatory employment practices contributed to the wealth gap (26).Lower-income communities often lack the means to advocate effectively for enhancements in environmental conditions, quality healthcare, access to good education, and the implementation of rigorous land use regulations (27). This disparity is particularly pronounced within minority populations, where higher levels of education are less common, and many individuals find themselves in low-paying, menial jobs, directly impacting their overall quality of life. Regrettably, this reduced standard of living does not promote saving but tends to lead to the accumulation of debt, further diminishing their overall quality of life. These financial constraints frequently hinder their ability to secure mortgages and relocate to areas with superior environmental conditions (25). In addition to these challenges, discriminatory lending policies and high interest rates often contribute to the accumulation of debt, making it even more difficult for these communities to break the cycle of financial hardship.Additionally, limited access to healthcare amplifies their vulnerability to environmental health risks, further compounding challenges (28) comprehensively explored the myriad factors contributing to wealth disparities, shedding light on a multifaceted and intricate challenge. Their research illuminated how income inequality, differences in homeownership rates, educational disparities, and variations in job opportunities all played crucial roles in shaping economic inequalities across various communities. These disparities were not confined to a single racial or ethnic group; they affected individuals from diverse backgrounds who were grappling with economic hardship. The disadvantages identified in their study extended to shared environmental challenges as well. These encompassed living in areas with poor air quality, contaminated water sources, proximity to toxic waste sites, labor market discrimination, and limited access to education and healthcare. Collectively, these adversities had a far-reaching impact, stretching across communities of all racial and ethnic backgrounds experiencing financial difficulties. It's important to underscore that despite the multifaceted nature of this issue, the literature consistently indicates that minority communities often bear a disproportionate burden (29). Their vulnerabilities, rooted in historical and ongoing systemic inequities, compound challenges, making it crucial to address these disparities comprehensively and systematically. Limited political influenceThe issue of underrepresentation of poor communities in mainstream media is a significant factor contributing to environmental justice challenges. Often, these communities are not adequately represented in the media, leading to a generalized lack of awareness and understanding of the specific adversities they face. This situation hampers their ability to effectively voice their concerns and needs, as highlighted in reference (24).Furthermore, these communities typically wield less political clout, posing a substantial obstacle in advocating for and implementing policies that safeguard their interests. A recurring theme in environmental justice discourse is the inadequate representation of minority and impoverished communities in key decision-making forums. Their interests are often sidelined in environmental policy decisions, primarily because these communities seldom have representatives in influential governing bodies. This absence of representation means that decisions affecting their lives and environment are often made without their input or best interests in mind, leading to disproportionate exposure to environmental hazards and pollution. This systemic issue underscores the need for more inclusive representation in decision-making processes to address and rectify environmental injustices. Proximity to industrial zonesBullard (5) argued that communities of color are disproportionately burdened by environmental pollution and other environmental hazards. Policies such as zoning, land use, and environmental regulation have contributed to and perpetuate disparities, asserting that 'systemic racism' is a primary driver in environmental justice (5). Poor communities may be located closer to industrial zones because of lack of employment. The leaders in the local communities encourage industries to be set up in their locality to employ inhabi","",https://doi.org/10.22541/au.170965072.20316399/v1,"",,

This study integrated random forest (RF), self-organizing map (SOM), and artificial neural network (ANN) techniques to assess water demand patterns and to develop a predictive model for the city of Fortaleza, Brazil. We performed the analysis at two spatial scales, with different level of information: census tracts (CTs) at the fine scale, and census blocks (CBs) at the coarse scale. At the CB scale, demand was modeled with socioeconomic, demographic, and household characteristics. The RF technique was applied to rank these variables, and the most relevant were used to cluster census blocks with SOMs. RFs and ANNs were used in an iterative approach to define the input variables for the predictive model with minimum redundancy. At the CT scale, demand was modeled using HDI and per capita income. Variables which assess the education level and economic aspects of households demonstrated a direct relationship with water demand. The analysis at the coarse scale provided more insight into the relationship between the variables; however, the predictive model performed better at the fine scale. This study demonstrates how data-driven models can be helpful for water management, especially in environments with strong socioeconomic inequalities, where urban planning decisions should be integrated and inclusive.","",https://doi.org/10.1061/(asce)wr.1943-5452.0001310,"",,
rayyan-210791387,Deep Learning based Framework for Semantic Segmentation of Satellite Images,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"A sharp increase in the availability of satellite imagery data sets available in the recent past has made the explanation of all those data with a challenging problem. Retrieving useful information and insights from images taken by satellite or any other aerial imagery system requires a good understanding of the information present in the images itself. This work focuses on the design and implementation of an automated model to extract semantic maps of waterways, roadways, buildings to track urban cities growth of satellite imagery. As it is a machine learning problem, a deep neural network is implemented and evaluated experimentally. Open source, publicly available frameworks and datasets are used in this work. The result of this work is a pre-processing image model, which enables the user to take an input image with different quality and resolution and apply the semantic segmentation on it. U-Net is used as the underlying architecture for this project, because of many advantages and functionalities it provides, as an example, we can say less computation time, which can help starters in the field of AI and computer vision to build their prototype and models fast without the need of too much hardware (GPU, Processor, and RAM). To get a better result and decrease the amount of pressure on machine, FCN (Fully Connected Neural Network) is used along with U-Net. As FCN has skip layer function and it also makes the network to learn faster and give more accurate results than CNN due to normalizing the pooling layers which in CNN it makes the network to lose lots of information about the data. The primary purpose of this work is to implement Semantic Segmentation on satellite images taken from urban areas, SpaceNet dataset provides such a data. The data selected for this project is from Khartoum (Capital of Sudan), it is a developing and deserted city. The result of this work will help in managing resources such as agriculture, natural energy, and water, checking on natural disasters and responding to it, like floods, earthquakes, and tsunamis checking on environmental use such as deforestation and monitoring urban development.","",https://doi.org/10.1109/iccmc48092.2020.iccmc-00069,"",,
rayyan-210791421,A NEOTERIC SMART AND SUSTAINABLE FARMING ENVIRONMENT INCORPORATING BLOCKCHAIN‐BASED ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE APPROACH,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"The rapid increase in the global population has resulted in an estimated increase of 70% in agricultural production by 2050 to meet the ever-increasing demands of people. To develop cost-effective agricultural solutions, 90% intensification of technological farming is required for achieving agricultural inputs and market demands. Today, the agricultural sector is affected by various factors like increased labor costs, increased population, crop failures, unpredictable yields, extreme weather, climate change, market fluctuations, etc. All these factors have directly or indirectly affected the socioeconomic status of farmers. With such a large number of challenges and increasing demands there is a need to implement an artificial intelligence-based approach for developing smart farming environment for the real-time monitoring and management of agricultural issues. According to a UN report, two-thirds of the world population will migrate to urban areas, resulting in a major decline in the agricultural workforce. This chapter proposes a smart farming environment based on artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain technology (BCT). Artificial Intelligence can be harnessed to automate and manage the agricultural and related tasks while blockchain technology can help in intensifying agri-food and supply chains. A sensational AI-based approach will help in developing the smart farming environment that can efficiently gather and monitor data for the real-time monitoring to address the uncertain issues faced by the agricultural community. BCT can handle issues related to the increased demands for agricultural products with transparency and trust. It will also accompany a variety of certifications schemes on branded agricultural products that face issues related to claims, labels and adulterations. BCT can prove to be an efficient solution for agricultural products’ safety, quality and sustainability. It will ensure the permanency of records during data sharing. The use of ICT in the agricultural sector will provide more efficient solutions for effective water and land usage resulting in maximum agricultural yields.

rayyan-210791717,Digital Water Approach for Smarter Water Management in Cities with Interconnected Infrastructure,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Water management in cities has come a long way since the inception of early infrastructure long time ago. The modern water systems provide safe and reliable service via effective supply of clean water and collection, disposal and recycling of wastewater. However, the increasing pressures arising from the climate change, population growth and urbanisation are posing further challenges that need to be addressed in the urban environment. The advancement of new technologies such as latest artificial intelligence and machine learning methods, intelligent sensors and actuators linked via internet of things and fast 5G communication networks (to name the few) provide an opportunity to manage water in cities in a fundamentally different way that is more sustainable and resilient but also less impactful on other infrastructure systems.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The talk will start by defining what is meant by a smart water system in the context of a smart city. This will be followed by the presentation of several advanced type technologies and solutions that have been developed for the improved management of water and wastewater in urban environment. This includes new data analytics type technology for the automated detection and location of pipe bursts/leaks, equipment failures and other failure events in a water distribution system. This technology detects failure events in these system by processing pressure, flow and other data in near real-time by using artificial intelligence and other methods. In addition to saving water, energy and other resources this technology has the potential to reduce or, in some cases, prevent the negative impact of WDS failures on other infrastructure systems (e.g. impact on a transport system via major road closure following a pipe burst).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Another example that will be presented is the new technology for automated asset condition assessment of sewers. This technology, currently being commercialised, &amp;amp;#160;processes standard CCTV data by using image processing and machine learning techniques to identify and classify structural and other faults in these pipes. The increased reliability and consistency of detection of these faults has the potential to reduce or remove the negative impact of related sewer failures on other critical urban infrastructure systems, e.g. impact on traffic or energy systems due to urban flooding and/or pollution that may occur as a result of non-detection.&amp;amp;#160; A number of other smart water technologies and solutions will be presented. Most of these were developed in collaboration with various water utilities hence are of direct relevance to engineering practice. The talk will end with the key message that digital water approach has a huge potential to improve things in the water and other sectors.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#160;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu2020-7259,"",,

rayyan-210791888,"[Spatial and temporal responses of habitat quality to urbanization: A case study of Changchun City, Jilin Province, China].",,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Habitat quality is an important index to evaluate regional ecological security. Revealing its spatial and temporal responses to urbanization is conducive to the in-depth implementation of new urbanization. Based on land use data, we analyzed the spatio-temporal characteristics of Changchun's landscape pattern, habitat quality and its sample zone from the grid scale with comprehensive utilization of spatial analysis and ecological model analysis. We further discussed the responses of habitat quality during urbanization. The results showed that the low values of patch density (PD), edge density (ED) and Shannon diversity index (SHDI) were distributed in the western plains, while the high aggregation index (AI) showed a patchy distribution in eastern and southern of the city. During 2000-2015, the habitat quality of Changchun showed a trend of degradation and significant spatial heterogeneity, showing a distribution of ""high in the east, and low in the west"". The expansion of construction land and the transportation infrastructure played a leading role in the degradation of regional habitat quality. The changes of habitat quality differed significantly in different zones. The overall variation of water belt was relatively small, while the variation frequency and amplitude of mountain, urban expansion, and traffic belt were relatively high. Natural factors including slope and elevation basically shaped the overall distribution pattern of habitat quality in Changchun, while urbanization factors including population density, GDP and night light index showed significant negative correlation with habitat quality. To alleviate the ecological pressure of urbanization and promote habitat quality, we proposed differentiated development strategies, such as preventing deforestation in the Dahei Mountains, using ecological strategies to restore habitat degradation areas, improving land use efficiency in built-up urban areas, promoting ""smart growth"" in urban areas, setting red line of farmland in hilly areas, and strengthening ecological infrastructure construction.生境质量是评价区域生态安全的重要指标,掌握其对城镇化发展的时空响应,有利于新型城镇化的深入推行。本研究基于土地利用数据,在综合利用空间分析及生态模型分析基础上,从网格尺度对长春市景观格局、生境质量及其样带进行时空特征分析,并进一步探讨生境质量在城镇化发展过程中的响应状况。结果表明: 长春市景观斑块密度、边缘密度及Shannon多样性指数低值多分布在西部平原地带,聚合度指数高值区则在市域东部及南部呈现片状格局。2000—2015年,长春市生境质量呈退化趋势且空间异质性显著,大致呈现出“东高西低”分布态势,建设用地扩张及交通基础设施建设对区域生境质量退化起到主导作用;不同样带内生境质量变化存在显著差异性,水域整体变化相对较小,而山脉、城市扩张及交通的变化频度及幅度处于较高水平。坡度及高程等自然因素基本塑造了长春市生境质量整体分布格局,而人口密度、国内生产总值、夜间灯光指数等城镇化要素与生境质量总体呈负相关关系。为缓解城镇化带来的生态压力、促进生境质量的回升,本研究提出防止大黑山脉林区滥砍乱伐、以生态手段修复生境退化地区,提升城镇建成区土地利用效率、促进城镇“精明增长”,设定丘陵地带耕地红线、加强生态基础设施建设等差异化发展策略。.","",https://doi.org/10.13287/j.1001-9332.202004.012,"",,
rayyan-210792079,Harnessing Technologies for Mitigating the Water Woes in the City of Bengaluru,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Industrialization has caused most of the world's environmental problems like climate change, water security issues, biodiversity issues among others. Water-related issues like water scarcity, lack of water quality, water sanitation issues, lack of proper water resources management are some of them. Urbanization, population increase, pollution has led to an increase in water demand. Water being the elixir of life, is essential for the day-to-day living of an individual. The Fourth Industrial Revolution technologies like AI, IoT, Blockchain, Machine Learning have the capability of bringing solutions to these issues. The current study focuses on the water woes of Bengaluru, a fast-growing urban city, due to its migrating population. The woes are also due to the irresponsible behaviour of builders converting lakes into real estate infrastructure leading to clogged drains, excess sewage creation and flooding. A huge mismatch between demand and supply of water is created due to these issues. Before the city hits the Day Zero – no water day, it is significant to set up water infrastructure along with technology implementation which will help resolve this burning issue at the earliest.","",https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3516768,"",,

The development of reliable methods for flood simulation have greatly improved our ability to predict floods thereby reducing damages and loss of life in flood-prone regions. However, there is still a lot of room for improvement and innovation to provide better predictions, especially for flash floods, particularly in urban areas &amp;amp;#160;This is addressed in the present study, the goal of which it is to improve simulation and prediction of flash floods and to develop a spatial decision-making model for implementing flood protection measures. In this regard, different approaches for flood simulation and flood protection should be applied. The proposed methodology links flood hazard modeling, remote sensing and machine learning methods. Combining these physical models and data driven methods will result in a more reliable hybrid model that can be employed for prediction of (flash) floods and event analysis. In order to achieve the research goal of present study we: i) add more functionality to a hydrodynamic model code; ii) complement the latter with data driven methods ;iii) develop a spatial decision-making model framework for defining flood protection measures, iv) validate process-based and data driven methods, and finally v) cross-evaluate Light Detection And Radar (LiDAR) topography with available local super-resolution drone data to assess the ability to incorporate local flood defenses into the models. The most important outcome is the creation of valuable flood maps in areas where it matters - while accounting for effects of land use and climate change. This will serve scientists as well as land and risk management authorities with better actionable flood risk information in locations where people and assets are located and in danger. It also develops innovative methodologies for estimating the changing risk from flash floods based on land use scenarios and climate change projections. Moreover, developing spatial multi-criteria decision making (SMCDM) can help decision makers to determine suitable locations and methods for flood protection measures. These methods will be particularly valuable in the context of solving current challenges of accounting for and mitigating flash floods and the effects of climate change.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu2020-13319,"",,

rayyan-210792585,"Sustainable, resilient, and reliable urban water systems: making the case for a “one water” approach",,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"An urban water system (UWS) has three main service components: (i) drinking-water; (ii) waste-water; and (iii) storm-water. Historically, each component in urban water development evolved over time with different objectives for “different” types of water. Even today, the trend continues, as different urban water services are managed in silos. This trend is less sustainable, resilient, and reliable, mainly because of significant pressures on freshwater supplies exerted by the increasing population, demand for high living standards, rapid urbanization, and climate change. To cope with these challenges, the conventional thinking needs to change. This paper identifies a number of significant research gaps related to inter-relationships among various UWS service components. An innovative paradigm, the “one water” approach (OWA), which considers “urban water” as a single entity, is investigated herein. Currently, Australia, the USA, and Singapore are leading the implementation of the OWA, whereas only a few Canadian municipalities have embraced OWA at a very basic level. Among the EU nations, the Netherlands have emphasized the need for integrated water resource management in an urban environment. This review highlights the challenges in adopting the OWA, and also proposes guiding principles in ongoing water management practices. Institutional complexities involving an intricate regulatory structure for different UWS service components, a wider fragmentation in decision making at government levels, and insufficient stakeholder engagement within and between water utilities and other institutions present serious challenges. Various strategies such as, data sharing between water utilities, use of novel technologies (e.g., artificial intelligence, sensor technologies), and visionary leadership at different government levels have been identified as key drivers for the adoption and implementation of the OWA. The authors believe that a paradigm shift from “conventional” approach to OWA is needed to increase resiliency and reliability of water services and assist decision-makers of UWSs.","",https://doi.org/10.1139/er-2020-0090,"",,

I propose an AI-based framework which might be useful for extracting indicators from remote sensing images and might help with predictive estimation of future states of these climate adaptation related indicators. When such models become more robust and used in real-life applications, they might help decision makers and early responders to choose the best actions to sustain the wellbeing of society, natural resources and biodiversity.

Spatio-temporal changes and driving force analysis of wetlands in Jiaozhou Bay. Journal of Coastal Research, 38(2), 328–344. Coconut Creek (Florida), ISSN 0749-0208. Jiaozhou Bay is the largest bay-type coastal wetland with high biodiversity in Shandong Peninsula. In recent years, the wetland of Jiaozhou Bay has been reduced dramatically due to urban expansion. It is significant to study the characteristics and causes of the wetland changes in the past 40 years for the rational exploitation and sustainable development of coastal wetland resources. The types, spatial distribution, and area information of the wetland from 1983 to 2019 are obtained by artificial visual interpretation and supervised classification using ten Landsat remote sensing images, assisted by Google images. The research analyzes the conversion of land use types and the change rule of landscape pattern in the wetland, as well as the driving forces of the wetland evolution and the uncertainty factors affecting the analysis results. The results indicate that the wetland area shows an overall decreasing trend from 1983 to 2019, 77% of which are converted into nonwetland. The wetland area increases initially, followed by a decrease from 1990 to 2000, but then continues to decrease slowly from 2000 to 2019. There are many types of land use changes from coastal tidal flats to other land use types such as construction land or pond, and the landscape pattern has been gradually fragmented. The continuous increase in temperature is the main natural cause for the degradation of the wetland. Population factor is the most important driving force for the change of the wetland. The main uncertain factors affecting the analysis results are the capture time of remote sensing image, tidal level correction, wetland classification system, and method. The results provide a basis for the decision-making of wetland protection. The quantitative data will provide a reference for the construction of a multiyear wetland dataset in Jiaozhou Bay.","",https://doi.org/10.2112/jcoastres-d-21-00075.1,"",,
rayyan-210792895,Smart Cities and Their Role in Enhancing Quality of Life,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Due to exponential rise in population, inadequate employment opportunities in the rural sector and aspirations of a better quality of life, there is a large-scale migration of rural population to the cities. This not only puts tremendous pressure on the limited resources of these urban centres but also is a challenging conundrum for all the agencies involved in urban planning. This chaotic scenario is further worsened as this migratory population vies for jobs, houses, civic amenities etc. with the urban population. These urban centres by virtue of their infrastructure, and geographical location become drivers of growth for any nation; therefore, it becomes important that these are efficiently managed and their meagre space and resources are optimally utilized. Self-sustainable ""Smart Cities"" are therefore the necessity of the future, in which technologies like Information and Communication Technology (ICT), Internet of Things (IoT), and Artificial Intelligence (AI) will substantially reduce human intervention in daily functioning of these cities and will form the basic framework for near autonomous management of services like health care, transport, infrastructure planning, power supply, law and order, tourism, immovable assets management, disaster management and sustainability issues, viz waste recycling.","",https://doi.org/10.1201/9781003009139-8,"",,

To this end, Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) neural networks, Markov chain model, GIS and TerrSet software package were used. Initially, nine driving variables affecting the future development of the city were identified. Then, using the maximum probability estimation model, land uses were classified into six categories in the MMA with an area of 8819.6 km2 for 2014, 2017 and 2020. During 2014–2020, two land uses have experienced positive changes (residential and cultivated land uses with 16.48% and 11.56% respectively) and four of them (forest cover with −5.74%, grass and green space with −9.72%, barren lands with −11.14% and water body with −1.45%) have experienced a decrease in area. To validate the prediction of land use changes until 2030, the kappa coefficient (0.617) was used. The result of using Cramer's V statistics (above 0.15) to measure the effect of driving variables on land use forecast was acceptable. LULC change was predicted by MLP and Markov chain model for 2030. The results showed that two land uses (residential and industrial land use with 26.3% and cultivated land with 6.99%) will have positive change and four of them (forest coverage with −17.11%, barren land with −9 29%, grass and green space with −5.33% and water bodies with −1.38%) should have negative growth. Spatial changes of land use will occur mostly in the northern and north-western regions on barren land, and on the east and southeast on forest and green spaces.

COVID-19 caused sudden economic, psychological, and partly physical shocks to markets, societal sub-systems (e.g., education, food, health), and people.As a direct consequence, today, food security and resilience are at stake. The effects on biobased products and bioenergy (in particular, biofuels) vary and their role in the recovery (with possible changes in customer's behavior) could differ as well.The linkages of the bioeconomy to post-pandemic recovery with regard to impacts and possible responses are currently being discussed by many institutions and initiatives, even though there is currently limited data on the impact of the pandemic on the bioeconomy.This report presents preliminary results based on initial analysis from the authors on knowledge synthesis on the EU bioeconomy system, trends, and perspectives of the future development towards 2030 and 2050.The main impacts reported so far from COVID-19 in the bioeconomy relevant sectors are:Food sectorThe COVID-19 pandemic hit the food system hard, putting food security at risk and causing reduced capacity of input provision to food chains. Further direct impacts concern production losses due to shortage of inputs and labor, reduced demand due to lockdown of canteens and restaurants and wastage of perishable product that could not be stored.Biobased products and materialsCOVID-19 so far had mixed impacts on forestry, non-food biobased products and chemicals. These impacts have both direct and indirect variable effects across Europe. However, in some areas, there has been significant disruption in forest management and forestry sector activities.BioenergyIEA analyzed the impacts of COVID-19 on the energy sector, in particular to renewables, including biofuels. Electricity demand in the EU dropped significantly, and according to IEA, projected reductions in 2020 compared to 2019 will be highest for oil, followed by coal, gas, and nuclear, while renewables should slightly increase.The COVID-19 pandemic occurred in a time when the EU policy agenda was taking a powerfully transformative shape: the European Green Deal, committed to foster sustainable development and achieving the targets of the Paris climate agreement, has specified respective goals, tools, and timelines. Rather than deviating from this pathway, the COVID-19 crisis shows that a system change is needed. However, it has also shown that this transformation may encounter several obstacles which require combining regulatory efforts, multi-level coordination, and massive finance to be overcome.As the EU and its Member States begin to emerge from lockdowns and plan recovery, respective strategies, and contingency plans to manage further waves of the pandemic, attention must return to addressing the climate crisis and building resilience—and in that, the bioeconomy has a role to play.Climate action will be mainstreamed in all EU programs funded under the Multiannual Financial Framework and Next Generation EU programs, with buffers for distributive effects (Just Transition Fund). The role of bioenergy and bioeconomy investments are also part of the EU Taxonomy which aims to clarify what ""green"" investments are.The enormous funds (both public and private) mobilized and significant economic stimulus packages developed to address the crisis offer opportunities to invest in the future, including in a sustainable circular bioeconomy which can put nature and restoration of natural capital at the center of the entire process. Member States will have to develop and implement adequate governance to handle such large resources and projects.The initial set of opportunities identified for a circular sustainable bioeconomy to contribute to a post-pandemic recovery include:Food sectorImproving food systems to become more sustainable and resilient will allow adapting fast to extreme events, as well as ensuring that future crises will only minimally affect food chains and vulnerable people. Key to that plan is the strengthened position of farmers in the value chains. Priority is in reorganizing agricultural supply systems based on the principles of agroecology, circularity, and One Health. Attention must be given to the blue bioeconomy and sustainable aquaculture as well as on urban agriculture that can improve quality of urban life. There is also significant interest from businesses and various start-ups in animal protein alternatives, biobased fibres, and respective marketing. Viewed in the context of a global food syndemic, the interplay of food insecurity, malnutrition, and obesity based on dietary behaviors amid the COVID-19 pandemic indicate opportunities for addressing social and structural determinants of healthy eating as a strategy to improve the health of people and the planet.Biobased materials and bioenergyCurrently, the industrial system is too linear, resource-intense, has limited provisions for biodiversity and ecosystem services and is mostly based on non-renewable resources. There are scalable innovations and viable technologies to produce sustainably sourced biobased alternatives, though, including public goods such as bioplastics, nanocellulose, and wood-based textiles as well as services such as bioenergy, which could significantly reduce both amounts of non-renewable materials used and GHG emissions while creating durable carbon pools. Both in biobased products and in bioenergy, possibilities to integrate biochemical and thermochemical processes gain attention, as well as the ability to valorize residues and co-products of upstream routes to improve on circularity. Also, the extraction of critical raw materials, as identified and listed by the EC, and their valorization beyond traditional routes and products should be developed in combination with biorefining processes.At present, it remains unclear how the COVID-19 pandemic will evolve and how it will impact daily life patterns in the long run: This applies to the first and second waves of the pandemic and even more to possible subsequent wave(s).However, a circular, sustainable and transformative bioeconomy, building on innovation and people's inclusion, represents great opportunities with at least partly solutions for the post-COVID-19 era and during the EU economic recovery. These cover all sectors of the bioeconomy and beyond – from agriculture, fishery and forestry to food, energy, materials, transport, and tourism as well as financing and cross-cutting options such as decentralized biorefineries, innovative bioprocessing, and stimulation of an inclusive ""BioWEconomy"".Concerning the recommended actions, considering the need to ensure a transition leaving no one out, both short- and long-term strategies should be immediately elaborated with dedicated measures. In that, supporting economic operators, communities, and stakeholders to overcome the crisis and preserve jobs and economic activities need to be combined with decarbonization and sustainable production and use models.In order to support the EU industry in its transformation towards a sustainable and circular bioeconomy, sufficient EU funds need to be leveraged to de-risk innovative projects and stimulate private investments, far beyond the €250 million which is the current target size of the European Circular Bioeconomy Fund. Furthermore, closely monitoring the effectiveness of these financial programs is essential.Given that the global pandemic is ongoing also in the EU and its Member States, and relatively little evidence exists yet on COVID-19 impacts and bioeconomy responses, the analysis presented here is preliminary and needs substantiation from further work, considering future results from monitoring, and scientific knowledge expected to arise in the 2021–2022 timeframe.It should also be investigated more deeply how the circular bioeconomy can counter sustainability implications of COVID-19 in urban and rural areas, and what impacts this will have on ecosystem services and on achieving the SDGs.IntroductionThis report presents results from initial analysis of the ad-hoc Network of Experts on the question: What are the most promising solutions and opportunities that the European bioeconomy can offer to support a green recovery from the coronavirus pandemic and enhance system resilience in the future?The authors addressed resilience in a knowledge synthesis on the EU bioeconomy system, trends, and perspectives of the future development towards 2030 and 2050.1 With the present report, this brief analysis is deepened to the extent possible, and open questions are summarized.Given that the global pandemic is ongoing in the EU and its Member States, relatively little evidence exists yet on COVID-19 impacts and bioeconomy responses. Thus, the analysis presented here is preliminary.It needs substantiation from further analysis, considering future results from monitoring, and scientific knowledge expected to arise in the 2021–2022 timeframe.Setting the Scene: COVID-19 and the EU bioeconomyThe COVID-19 pandemic is causing an unprecedented global health crisis and socio-economic upheaval since first reported in Wuhan, China, on 31 Dec. 2019.2 On 9 January 2020, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control published a Threat Assessment Brief on the cluster of pneumonia possibly associated with the novel coronavirus in Wuhan.3On 24 Jan. 2020, the first European case was reported in France.2 In Fall 2020, the so-called second wave reached many European countries, causing further lockdown.The pandemic led to severe consequences well beyond previous crises which mostly were related to financial (banking, stock market) issues. It represents a sudden economic, psychological, and partly physical shock to markets, societal sub-systems (e.g., food, health), and people.This ""Black Swan"" socio-economic event was impossible to predict due to its extreme rarity.4 Authorities and companies were neither prepared for it, nor have they planned to transition beyond it.5Today, food security and resilience are at stake. The effects on biobased products and bioenergy (in particular, transport fuels) are different, and their role in the recovery could differ as well due to possible changes in customer's behavior.The linkages of the bioeconomy and post-pandemic recovery is currently being discussed by many,6–9 both with regard to impacts, but also possible responses.10Before addressing the latter in more detail below, the following sections present a wrap-up of current understanding of COVID-19 impacts on the EU bioeconomy.Impacts on the Food SystemThe COVID-19 pandemic hit the food system hard, putting food security at risk. The impact is systemic, affecting not only components of food value chains but also generating indirect and delayed effects and feedback.11Table 112,13 illustrates the significant impacts of COVID-19 on the food system and respective food security implications.Table 1.

Home cooking increased, shifting logistics and consumption patterns (e.g., for pre-processed food), and potentially rising food waste, though evidence in some countries points to reducing food wastes.14COVID-19 has impacted unequally on individuals, social groups, enterprises, and territories and widened existing inequalities. Most vulnerable groups have suffered the most substantial losses, e.g., mini-jobbers, single-parent families, and homeless people. The food system was also subject to COVID-19 hotspots, e.g., the centralized slaughterhouses employing temporary workers living in crowded places in Germany closed temporarily as a result of workers experiencing high illness rates and to halt transmission of COVID-19 in their communities.12,15Impact on Biobased Products and MaterialsCOVID-19 so far had mixed impacts on forestry, non-food biobased products and chemicals. These impacts have been both direct and indirect and there have also been variable effects across Europe. The demand for single-use plastics for wrappings and packaging materials increased and this is expected to continue, implying the growth of future potential for biobased plastic substitutes.16 The increased interest in the use of biobased materials for the improvement of living conditions could be further mobilized. Linking ""nature-based solutions"" to the production of biobased products (as described in more detail below) may be important for effective recovery, also ensuring the maintenance and improved resilience of forests.In some areas, there has been significant disruption in forest management and forestry sector activities. Table 2 provides an overview of COVID-19 impacts on the forest and woody biomass processing sectors.Table 2. Overview of Impacts of COVID-19 on the Forest and Wood Processing SectorsACTIVITYIMPACTTotal wood supplyIn some areas it has almost been ""business as usual,"" in others there have been some restrictions to ""essential"" activities including limitations to supply wood only to those industries categorized as ""essential"".Construction wood supplyVariable impacts but generally, a reduction in construction wood supply, in some cases a complete collapse, related to suspension or decline in construction activities. The situation recovered quickly after lifting of lockdowns.Increased consumption of certain ""niche"" products, e.g., garden decking and furniture, as people sought to renovate gardens and homes during lockdowns.Small roundwood supplySome regions have noticed significant increases in small roundwood production for paper, card, and pallet wood, related to an upsurge in online shopping.Waste and recyclingDuring lockdowns, home renovation and ""stock cleaning"" led to rising demand for new clothing and furniture which increased household waste, and the recycling of used textiles.Forest managementLockdown measures restricted workforce activities (e.g., reduced mobility of migrant workers, social distancing during tree planting) or slowed processing of e.g., harvesting permits. In some areas, activities are limited to ""essentials"", e.g., responding to forest fires or pest/disease outbreaks. Generally, it is taking longer to deliver outputs at pre-COVID levels. Some activities have been reduced or completely stopped, e.g., forest surveys, consultancy.Recreation and tourismCommercial activities in forest areas providing holiday and recreation facilities and services have been reduced or completely stopped.Own compilation.Activities enabling social engagement with nature and rural areas (recreation, tourism) have been hit hard, suggesting recovery may be difficult; this could be particularly damaging for rural revitalization and may have wider implications for health and wellbeing in the period after the pandemic.Impacts on BioenergyIEA analyzed the impacts of COVID-19 on the energy sector, in particular to renewables, including biofuels.17 Electricity demand in the EU dropped significantly,18 and according to IEA,17 projected changes in 2020 compared to 2019 are highest for oil, followed by coal, gas, and nuclear, while renewables slightly increase (Fig. 1).17Fig. 1. Projected changes in primary energy demand by fuel in 2020 relative to 2019.The drop in oil demand is predominantly caused by COVID-19 impacts on the transport sector, especially aviation, and scenarios indicate possible lasting reductions.19Bioenergy, the largest renewable energy source globally and in the EU, was also partly impacted by COVID-19 and the spring lockdowns put in place by many EU countries,20 and lockdowns following in the fall 2020. Notably, investments in the (bio)energy sectors are expected to decline in 2020 due to the unfavorable and challenging economics (lower profits and cash flows, higher debts, reduced demand).21IEA forecasts carried out during the first pandemic wave estimated a significant recovery of oil demand by December 2020 in the different regions of the world. However, the second wave of COVID-19 affecting many EU countries changed this expectation.Concerning biofuels, production is expected to fall by 13% in 2020 due to transport fuels' reduction demand, while in 2021, the 2019 level may be reached again (Fig. 2).19 However, the effects of the second pandemic wave, and a possible third one, could further delay the return to consumption patterns comparable to pre-pandemic (Table 3).Fig. 2. IEA biofuel production forecast.Table 3. Summary of Main Impacts of COVID-19 on the (Bio)energy SystemACTIVITYIMPACTElectricity and CHP generationReduced demand for electricity, with limited impact on bioenergy, because heating is the main market and feed-in priority given to renewables.The biomass-based cogeneration sector showed good resistance to COVID-19 impacts, given the role of bioenergy in the renewable energy system, delivering heat and electricity to end-users, and the type of contracts in place. Feedstock supply was however partly affected by the pandemic, and this in turn impacted on bioenergy generation. Delay (or even halting) of energy investments was also a critical element for the sector.Heat generationThe heating sector was rather resilient to the pandemic, in particular the pellet sector, which benefits from long-term contracts. Moreover, heating is viewed as an ""essential"" service.Transport fuelsTransport was the most impacted area by COVID-19: fuel demand in some sectors almost collapsed, in particular in aviation. Reduction in diesel and gasoline demands directly translate into reductions of biofuels, as quota are expressed in percentages. Oil price fell, lack of storage capacity emerged, and thus opportunities for renewable fuels also diminished, given the very low oil prices. Investments and financing of new initiatives on transport fuel halted: this heavily impacted also on investments in the renewable fuel area. Some companies redirected their business to sanitisation and disinfectants (in particular, the ethanol sector).Source: Own compilation.Recovery: Build Back Better with the BioeconomyThe COVID-19 pandemic occurred in a time when the EU policy agenda was taking a powerfully transformative shape: the European Green Deal, committed to achieving the SDGs and the targets of the Paris climate agreement, has specified respective goals, tools, and timelines.22 Rather than deviating from this pathway, the COVID-19 crisis has shown that a system change is needed. However, it has shown also that this transformation may encounter several obstacles, and that their removal requires a combination of regulatory effort, multi-level coordination, and massive financial resources.1As the EU and the Member States begin to emerge from the lockdowns and plan their recovery, respective strategies, and contingency plans to manage further waves of the pandemic, attention must return to addressing the climate crisis and building resilience23–and in that, the bioeconomy has a role to play.24–28In parallel to the pandemic, the ambition to meet the Paris climate agreement increased in the EU and elsewhere (e.g., China, Japan, Korea), in parallel to the need of financing new initiatives aligned with the European Green Deal goals. Climate action will be mainstreamed in all EU programs funded under the Multiannual Financial Framework29 and Next Generation EU programs, with buffers for distributive effects (Just Transition Fund).30 The enormous funds (both public and private) mobilized and significant economic stimulus packages developed to address the crisis offer opportunities to invest in the future, including in a sustainable circular bioeconomy which can put nature and restoration of natural capital at the center of the entire process.31Burger et al. (2020) evaluated 130 studies and programs on design and effectiveness of 'green' economic recovery.32 They found a broad consensus on criteria to be applied and suitable areas of support: climate adaptation measures and nature-based solutions (e.g., reforestation)33 are frequently recommended. However, only a fraction of the stimulus measures adopted worldwide have so far been ""green"", and explicit notion of sustainable bioeconomy options in the recovery is scarce. Green stimulus includes a long list of possible COVID-19 recovery interventions that support low-carbon development and build climate and disaster resilience:34–39Improvements in climate-smart agricultural value chains enhancing biodiversity and sustainable food supply systemsDeploying industry green transition, incorporating more sustainable production modes and ICT/AI in the value chainUpgrade of health facilities to disaster and climate resilience standardsHealth projects promoting disaster preparedness (e.g., long-term disease surveillance)Energy efficiency schemes, including support for retrofits (e.g., low-interest loans), construction of low-energy buildings, and skill developmentRural green infrastructure projects, such as grid expansion and off-grid rural electrification, and rural low-carbon household programs, such as clean cooking programs (biogas, efficient wood-burning stoves) and solar lightingLabor market programs to protect natural assets and green infrastructuresInvestment in education and training, natural capital investment, and clean R&D.In the following, opportunities for a circular sustainable bioeconomy to contribute to a post-pandemic recovery are presented, focusing on the EU.Options in the Food SystemThe pandemic has revealed that our food systems are not resilient enough to adapt to severe stress, such as economic crises and climate change.40 Although being different in nature, the pandemic crisis and climate risks have common characteristics as both of them represent physical shocks, systemic, non-stationary, and regressive changes.The current pandemic could be a preview of future shocks from climate change to supply and demand, disruption of food supply chains, and global pathogen transmission. Moreover, measures taken against each could result to improve the other, e.g., steps taken in climate-resilient infrastructure could increase economic and environmental resiliency.Improving food systems to become more sustainable and resilient should be more than ever an urgent priority, including contingency plans and mitigation strategies that allow adapting fast to extreme events, as well as ensuring that inevitable crises will minimally affect food chains and vulnerable people.41Key to these plans is the strengthened position of farmers in the value chains.42 Both the Green Deal and the CAP emphasize cooperation of producers within producer organizations and respective associations, which will allow producers to strengthen their position in supply chains as well as their resilience to economic and environmental challenges and contribute to climate action.The EU Farm to Fork Strategy43 and the Biodiversity Strategy44 indicate the need for transforming in the food system: carbon neutrality, radical reduction of pesticides and fertilizers, a significant increase of organic farming and protected areas. As some of the root causes of the pandemic crisis are in the food system, the commitment to change is even stronger.12 A key priority will be related to the reorganization of agricultural supply systems, based on the principles of agroecology,45 circularity,46 and One Health47,48 to radically reduce GHG emissions, pollution and the risks related to human/animal interfaces.As known, the most relevant critical point of the supply system is livestock, using about 40% of agricultural land.50 Animals can play an important role in circular agricultural systems, as they can use biomass (e.g., grasses) that cannot be used in other ways, and can contribute to soil fertility through their excreta. Incentives and compensation should be addressed to the conversion of intensive livestock systems into integrated crop-livestock systems, bringing to a Livestock Unit/ha rate of 1 by 2030.In parallel, tighter regulation of antibiotic use and support to antibiotic-free labelling as well as significant incentives to organic farming are required to achieve the goal of 25% of the area under organic farming by 2030. All of that will be subject to the next medium-term CAP reform.51,52 A further point of attention will be blue bioeconomy resources.53 As fish capture cannot be expanded,54 investments should be made in sustainable aquaculture–especially in multitrophic systems – and in cultivating algae.1Urban agriculture in all its forms, from community gardening to rooftop agriculture to vertical farming, will contribute to the green transition, making urban areas less dependent on long-distance trade for fresh vegetables, improving quality of urban life and contributing to consumers' education.1 For that, increased policy intervention is needed on dietary choices,56 with investments in food retail, initiatives to make fresh and nutritious food more affordable, and regulation of junk food.Food industries should innovate fast enough within the imminent economic crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, offering affordable and competitive products, e.g., by developing functional foods fortified with bioactive compounds and antioxidants that promote health and support consumers' immune system.56 These products may emerge from food processing by-products, grasses, fungi, microalgae, seaweeds, and yeast that reduce inflammatory responses typically associated with cytokine storm in severe COVID-19 patients.4 There is also significant interest from existing businesses and various start-ups in animal protein alternatives, biobased fibers, and respective marketing.57Viewed in the context of a global food syndemic, the interplay of food insecurity, malnutrition, and obesity based on dietary behaviors amid the COVID-19 pandemic indicate opportunities for addressing social and structural determinants of healthy eating as a strategy to improve the health of people and the planet.58,59As part of the farm to fork chains, more safety measures are needed since more people (and subsequently more potential infection) are involved in the process. Thus, there is a need to develop respective bioanalytical protocols for food and environmental","",https://doi.org/10.1089/ind.2021.29248.ufr,"",,

Sustainability could include urban water management to alleviate possible conflict among &amp;amp;#8220;water&amp;amp;#8208;saving&amp;amp;#8221; and &amp;amp;#8220;greening cities&amp;amp;#8221; strategies. Water consumption by urban greenery has a major role in urban water management, particularly in water-scarce regions where green covers are most affected by drought and aridity. More green and blue water resources are required to maintain and expand urban green spaces. Quantifying the water footprint of urban greenery helps to balance greening cities while water saving from both green and blue water resources. We employed remote sensing and artificial intelligence techniques to assess the water consumption and water footprint of a 780&amp;amp;#8208;ha public green space, the Adelaide Parklands in Australia. We estimated the green and blue water footprint of this green space (containing 29 parks) during 2010-2018 on a monthly basis. Our results showed that the mean total water footprint of the Adelaide Parklands was about 7.75 gigaliter per annum over 2010-2018; it varied from 7.19 gigaliter/year in 2018 to 8.45 gigaliter/year in 2012. The blue water footprint was consistently higher than the green water footprint even in wet time of the year. We suggest implementing sponge city and water sensitive urban design (WSUD) techniques to help greening cities while reducing the water footprint of urban green spaces. These approaches have the potential to lessen the pressure on blue water resources and optimise the consumption of green water resources.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu21-100,"",,

Aligning policy programs and research with the SDGs is a key strategic undertaking occurring in the world by development and environmental stakeholders.The SDGs also advance a long-standing discourse and practice on development. In virtually every society, past and present, issues of dignity, fairness, justice, and respect, as spelled out in the SDGs, have been considered in the organization of the social, political, and economic activities of communities. This reality means that concerns about the ethical development of society is not limited to the present.What is a good life? and What is a good society? are age-old questions associated with Aristotle (Marangos et al., 2019), but also expressed in different ways within different societies (Kinyanjui, 2021; Mbiti, 1969). As relevant today as ever, institutions and procedures have been created to help ensure that ethical principles are followed as people and nations pursue their development aspirations (North, 1990).A criticism leveled against the SDGs is that they do not include an explicit ethical dimension. The absence of a stand-alone ethical dimension leaves the matter of ethics an implicit rather than explicit concern. As such, it remains necessary to interrogate the SDG discourse to identify and define the nature of an ethical reflection to guide the implementation of these goals. In this context, the perspective provided examines the ethical dimension of the SDGs and pursues this objective by addressing two questions: What ethical issues are raised by the SDGs?What principles and values can guide an ethical implementation of the SDGs?In answering these questions, the discussion furthers the sustainability and development discourse.Ethical analysis can take one or more of three basic approaches: descriptive, prescriptive or normative, and metaethical (Njoroge & Bennaars, 1986). While the descriptive aspect presents or narrates a moral situation as it exists, the prescriptive or normative aspect presents the required or expected moral behavior and its source. It is the metaethical approach that questions the reasons behind an existing or expected moral behavior. These three approaches are utilized in this discussion to determine the ethical positions implicitly advanced or assumed in the SDGs, going beyond description to identify the core principles and values and ethical standards pursued or implied in these goals.A close examination of the SDGs reveals a relationship to ethical issues that have been of concern for centuries. In every practical sense, the scope and language of the 17 SDGs and associated 169 targets look like a summation of the ethical questions and concerns raised by scholars, political leaders, citizens, practitioners, and philosophers over the years on key human development and environmental issues (United Nations, 2015).Goal 1. End poverty in all its forms everywhere.Goal 2. End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture.Goal 3. Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages.Goal 4. Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all.Goal 5. Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls.Goal 6. Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all.Goal 7. Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all.Goal 8. Promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment, and decent work for all.Goal 9. Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization, and foster innovation.Goal 10. Reduce inequality within and among countries.Goal 11. Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable.Goal 12. Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns.Goal 13. Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts.Goal 14. Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas, and marine resources for sustainable development.Goal 15. Protect, restore, and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation, and halt biodiversity loss.Goal 16. Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels.Goal 17. Strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the global partnership for sustainable development.Scholars and practitioners of moral philosophy will recognize that the principles and values contained in these goals have been of central concern to ethicists of politics, society, and development, including Aristotle, Louis Lebret, Denis Goulet, Amartya Sen, and Martha Craven Nussbaum (Gasper, 2012; Marangos et al., 2019). From an ethical perspective, it can be argued that the SDGs are development aspirations, and are expected to contribute to the realization of the good life and a good society. They are underlain by fundamental ethical concerns such as inequality, social justice, poverty, human rights, freedom, and choice, which have been and remain at the center of real life, philosophical discourse, and development ethics (Gasper, 2012; Marangos et al., 2019).Paragraphs 7, 8, and 9 of the Declaration of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development state its vision, highlighting these very ethical concerns (United Nations, 2015, p. 5). The statements demonstrate that an ethical dimension is both explicit and implicit to the SDG discourse. In lieu of an ethics dimension, what is lacking is a framework or a process for a sustained reflection, analysis, and stance on the level of achievement toward the ethical values and principles behind the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. As pointed out by Gasper (2012): ""Development""—whether understood as fundamental transformations including industrialisation, urbanisation, globalisation and more; as planned intervention; as improvement in human welfare; or as expansion of valued attainable opportunities—is correspondingly a strongly ethically-laden field. What are all the running, risk-taking and intervention for? What are improvement, welfare, the good life? Why are so many of the materially affluent spiritually poor? Who benefits, who loses? Who decides, who is consulted, who is not? Whose values count? (p. 2)The ethical issues and questions raised by Gasper (2012) cannot be dismissed; nor can we assume that they will resolve themselves by merely rhetorically aligning national and international development programs with the SDGs. It cannot, for instance, be assumed that there is a universal morality of human goodness and care that will make all countries and individuals pursue altruism, inclusion, equity, and peace in striving to attain the SDGs. Nor is there any guarantee that stating desired ethical outcomes will ensure they are achieved.There is a need to critically reflect on these ethical values in view of a human history in which the exploitation of other human beings has been fundamental to the development process (Easterly, 2007; Galeano, 2009; Rodney, 1972; Zinn, 2010). Human history has thousands of footprints of struggles for justice by individuals and groups when their right to life and dignity has been threatened (Easterly, 2007; Galeano, 2009; Rodney, 1972; Zinn, 2010). Thus, the implementation of SDGs requires a deep ethical reflection interrogating the values, principles, and implementation practices that will be pursued to exploit emergent opportunities and address barriers on the pathway to 2030. This reflection is necessary in view of the emerging observation that only two of the SDGs—eliminating preventable deaths among newborns and under-five-year-olds and getting children into primary schools—are closest among all the goals to being achieved (Nature, 2020). While the value of the SDGs is recognized, there is growing concern that most of them will not be achieved: The goal to eliminate extreme poverty will not be met because some 430 million people are expected still to be living in such conditions in 2030. … Targets to end hunger and to protect climate and biodiversity are completely off track. Whereas some of the richer countries are making a degree of progress in the SDGs overall, two-thirds of poorer ones are not expected to meet those that relate even to their most basic needs."" (Nature, 2020, p. 7)Existing frameworks found in moral philosophy, development ethics, universal declarations, and national legislation can provide direction in identifying the values and principles that will facilitate an ethical framework to guide decisions, practices, and actions in implementing the SDGs. There are different schools of moral philosophy, such as Aristotelian thought on a virtuous and good life, Jeremy Bentham's and John Stuart Mill's utilitarianism, John Dewey's pragmatism, and African ubuntuism, that can be drawn upon to appraise and clarify values and behavior related to what is just, good, bad, right, wrong, and appropriate in SDG implementation. In addition to these specific schools of moral philosophy, there are frameworks mentioned in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.The new Agenda is guided by the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, including full respect for international law. It is grounded in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, international human rights treaties, the Millennium Declaration and the 2005 World Summit Outcome Document. It is informed by other instruments such as the Declaration on the Right to Development. (United Nations, 2015, paragraph 10)The essence of an ethical reflection is not so much to have an extensive list of procedures to follow. Rather, the purpose is to engage in the thoughtful and explicit examination and evaluation of ethical questions and to develop a critical awareness of the values and principles that inform choices, decisions, and actions that people take when addressing these questions (Gustavus Adolphus College, n.d.). Such a reflection is in line with an ethics of development that is devoted to ""examination of ethical and value questions posed by development theory, planning, and practice, in order to diagnose value conflicts, assess policies, and assess valuations placed on development performance"" (Goulet, 1997, as cited by Gasper, 2012). Examples of ethical questions, principles, and values that have been raised by the SDGs and require ethical reflection and action follow.Ethics, like other branches of philosophy, questions and seeks to clarify definitions and assumptions underlying a proposition or a position. Therefore, a key ethical question is: Whose definition and view of development are the SDGs advancing? The aim of the SDGs to improve quality of life for all and create a better world for all humanity, one built on human rights and justice, is a commendable ethical aspiration toward a good life and humane society.Implied within the 17 SDGs and 169 targets is the offer of a comprehensive view of development. However, development is a multidimensional concept, meaning different things to different people. An ethical approach requires an honest accounting of whose definition and measurement of development should be considered in programs designed to support the SDGs. Economic growth, measured by gross domestic product (GDP), dominates as a key indicator of development in the SDGs. However, development is a diverse field of research and practice involving the contributions of and participation by different academic disciplines and communities of practice. Different schools of thought have advanced different ideas over the years as to what constitutes development and how it can be realized.While an emphasis on economic development dominated development discourse in the 1960s, this school of thought was challenged by those who argued that social aspects of development were also important (Seers, 1972). There also emerged a school of development that made a strong case for looking at justice in the distribution of benefits from development (Goulet, 1997). It argued that development should focus on the development of the total person and should aim at reducing or eliminating inequality and poverty as well as expanding freedoms and choice for people (Goulet, 1997; Sen, 1999). There is currently a growing interest in extending measurements of development beyond economic indicators to focus on measures of human development, such as capability, well-being, freedom, and happiness (Gasper, 2012; Sen, 1999). In addition to these broad development definitions and measures, there are experiential development realities at national and subnational levels. Global development goals therefore need to consider a more nuanced, multi-scaled definition of the values and principles that constitute a good life.In light of the multifaceted possibilities for defining development, determining whether governments and investors will mainly measure development in terms of profit and economic growth is important as the SDG programs are rolled out. Though measures of development beyond economic indicators are difficult to implement, there have been efforts to explore alternative approaches. An example of this effort is in the human development index (HDI), which consists of economic and social indicators: education, health, and standard of living. The HDI was refined in 2010 to adjust for gender, inequality, and multidimensional poverty (United Nations Development Programme, 2020). Even as countries produce their national human development reports, they still rely on GDP as a key indicator of development (Bell & Morse, 2018).Another effort is the Sustainable Development Analytical Grid, which has been tested in several contexts. It has ethical, social, ecological, economic, and governance dimensions with 32 themes for analysis (Villeneuve et al., 2017). This tool gives room to communities, programs, and stakeholders to vary the weights assigned to different themes, providing opportunities for entities to identify and measure what is important or what matters to them. However, it should be noted that there remain competing priorities among entities about what constitutes development. Thus, it is important for entities, including governments, investors, and communities, to define measures as they move ahead with their development objectives. To some, wealth creation is of greater importance, while to others ecological protection is foremost. In most cases, development goals are manifold, calling for a reflection on how best to define and measure development in specific contexts.A further area of SDG implementation calling for an ethically grounded reflection is accountability. Accountability is not only about determining who is answerable when things go wrong, but also about establishing and adhering to a mechanism for owning a decision and taking responsibility for executing actions toward achieving the SDGs. As efforts are made to translate the SDGs into actionable national and subnational development programs, there is an ongoing need for reflection by and of those responsible for this translation, and to assess whether they are satisfactorily doing it. Can they be held accountable by the public for successes as well as failures in the delivery of SDGs? While the central role of countries or governments is highlighted in the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda, consideration of the capability of governments to deliver the agenda is required (United Nations, 2015): We recognize that each country has primary responsibility for its own economic and social development. The new Agenda deals with the means required for implementation of the Goals and targets. We recognize that these will include the mobilization of financial resources as well as capacity-building and the transfer of environmentally sound technologies to developing countries on favourable terms, including on concessional and preferential terms, as mutually agreed. Public finance, both domestic and international, will play a vital role in providing essential services and public goods and in catalyzing other sources of finance. We acknowledge the role of the diverse private sector, ranging from micro-enterprises to cooperatives to multinationals, and that of civil society organizations and philanthropic organizations in the implementation of the new Agenda. (paragraph 41)Though countries are recognized as the key players in delivering the SDGs, a global partnership of many actors is envisaged. Hence, the need to reflect on how responsibility is shared among the different entities mentioned in the quote, and on the forces that may affect implementation arrangements. There is a need to clarify how the SDGs are to become part of the social contract between the governors and the governed, and on how the SDGs will be integrated into the diverse government planning cultures and practices around the world. Note that the ethical issue being raised here is on how responsibility and accountability will be handled to ensure that the SDGs are translated into national and local development aspirations and practices.Maintaining responsibility and accountability gets at the heart of ensuring an ethics of practice in the implementation of the SDGs. A 2016 review of efforts to mainstream SDGs into national plans and frameworks of 16 countries showed that the main activities to date had focused on: 1.) mapping existing national plans and frameworks against the SDGs, 2.) setting up dedicated government entities to ensure policy coherence, and 3.) formulating long-term visions covering the full duration of the 2030 Agenda (United Nations Development Group, 2016). Measures defined in the SDG global indicator framework are also reported to be getting localized.More recently, several countries are reported to have integrated the 2030 Agenda into national frameworks. However, major gaps and challenges have been identified, including lack of internationally comparable data for 13 goals for most countries, as well as the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic (United Nations, 2020). Even before COVID-19, assessments found that progress remained uneven and the world was not on track to meet SDGs by 2030 because global efforts have been insufficient to deliver the transformative change required (United Nations, 2020). This state of affairs points to the need to reflect on and assess the capability of governments, and the willingness of governmental and nongovernmental entities to assume responsibility for attaining the SDGs. The extent to which countries have integrated SDGs into national development frameworks is unclear. Hence, the arguable need to look deeply into accountability and mechanisms by which countries are held responsible for complying with SDGs.As pointed out in the in the 2016 UN Development Group report, to achieve the SDGs and make progress on Agenda 2030, ethical reflection and assessment are necessary to achieve coherence between the global vision and the local context. The implication of these findings for SDGs is that without a sustained ethical reflection that guarantees realistic translation and responsible stewardship of their implementation at national and local levels, they could easily become another lost opportunity when we review our progress in 2030.ReferencesBell , S., & Morse , S.

Case Study: &amp;#160;Combeima River, Colombia.",,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The importance of knowing and representing rural and urban development in water management is vital for its sustainability.&amp;amp;#160; An essential part of the management required that stakeholders are more aware of the consequences of decisions and in some way, can link decisions towards sustainability.&amp;amp;#160; For this, a mobile app serious game called Water Citizens has been proposed as knowledge dissemination and to provide a better understanding of the way decisions affect Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). A complex model of a pilot region (Combeima in Ibague, Colombia) has been developed, and the model results are few into equations to estimate fluctuations of SDGs in the region. Running this complex model in real-time, for a mobile application, requires an extensive high-performance computing system linked to large and complex network setup. To solve this problem, a fast yet accurate surrogate model is proposed.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Therefore, this study contemplates an analysis of methods to forecast sustainable development indicators evaluated through climate change scenarios for a period between 1989-2039. The proposed scenarios associated the public health, livestock, agriculture, engineering, education and environment sectors with climate variables, climate change projections, land cover and land use, water demands (domestic, agricultural and livestock) and water quality (BOD and TSS). Generating the possibility that each player can make decisions that represent the actions that affect or contribute to the demand, availability and quality of water in the region.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Consequently, a set of indicators were selected to recreate the dimensions of each sector and reflect its relationship with the Sustainable Development Objectives, as opposed to the decisions made by each player. In addition, three categories were considered for the levels of sustainability: low (0.0 - 0.33), medium (0.34 - 0.66) and high (0.67 - 1.0) for the calculated SDG values.&amp;amp;#160;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Self-learning techniques have been employed in the analysis of decision-making problems. In this study, the nearest K neighbours (k-NN) and a multilayer perceptron network (MLP) were used. Through an analysis based on the responses of the players and sustainability indexes, a multiple correlation analysis was developed in order to consolidate the learning dataset, which was randomly partitioned in proportions 0.7 and 0.3 for the training and test subsets respectively. Subsequently, the model fit and performance was carried out, analysing the MSE error metric and confusion matrix.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Finally, the results of this study will allow to determine the potential of supervised learning models as a decision-making tool for the evaluation of sustainable development, as well as to obtain a better abstraction and representation of the water resource to the challenges related to climate adaptation and water sustainability measures of citizen action, besides generating new approaches for the use of artificial intelligence in land use planning and climate adaptation processes.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu21-13929,"",,
rayyan-210793480,Assessing tree decay in an urban park using PlanetScope images: the case of Cerro Almodovar Park.,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Green urban areas play a major role in the quality of life of the citizens in terms of public health, environment and recreation. They help to improve air quality, control temperature and provide ecosystem services that contribute, like forests, to climate change mitigation. The health of urban tree stands is, therefore, essential to maintain the benefits that the urban and peri-urban parks provide to people and cities. Early detection of a reduction in vegetation health is essential to apply measures in order to prevent tree mortality or damage. The use of remote sensing technology for forest health monitoring has been widely demonstrated but the number of published papers using these techniques applied to urban parks is significantly lower. Nevertheless, the use of remote sensing offers excellent opportunities for monitoring the state of health of urban and peri-urban parks. It is a tool that can be very useful to complement on-site visits and make them more efficient by warning of suspected areas of damage. The main objective of this work was to evaluate the potential of PlanetScope images to estimate the degree of tree vegetation decay in the Cerro Almodovar urban park. It is located in the neighborhood of Aluche, in the Latina district, Madrid (Spain), and it had been observed that there were individuals that were beginning to show defoliation problems. Machine learning techniques were used to generate a mapping of the damage levels in the park as well as information on the uncertainty of the estimates. The good performance of the model obtained encourages further development of remote sensing health monitoring in urban green areas.","",https://doi.org/10.1117/12.2600081,"",,

Son una de las principales fuentes de emisiones y presiones sobre el medio ambiente, a la vez que sufren tambien en un alto grado las consecuencias de la contaminacion y degradacion ambiental asi como los efectos del cambio climatico. Esta situacion requiere como respuesta unas politicas de mitigacion y adaptacion que deben basarse en evidencias cientificas y propuestas tecnicas complejas, como pueden ser soluciones basadas en la naturaleza que pueden mejorar la calidad del aire o proteger contra inundaciones u olas de calor. Las evidencias cientificas a su vez se basan en la toma y analisis de datos. La toma de datos homogeneos y estandarizados es un reto tecnologico que muchas administraciones publicas tienen que afrontar sin los recursos suficientes. Para paliar esta situacion han ido surgiendo soluciones de toma, analisis y sintesis de datos provenientes de la teledeteccion. En particular, destaca Copernicus, el programa de Observacion Terrestre de la Comision Europea, que proporciona datos satelitales y servicios especificos, de forma gratuita y abierta. Esta comunicacion cientifica presentara diferentes aplicaciones de Copernicus que ayudan a apoyar politicas de mitigacion y adaptacion al cambio climatico, y de creacion de ciudades saludables. Tambien, se presentaran los servicios de Copernicus sobre Cambio Climatico (C3S), Atmosfera (CAMS) y Cobertura Terrestre (CLMS) que estan a disposicion de usuarios publicos y privados para crear aplicaciones y soluciones tecnologicas sostenibles. Adicionalmente, se llevara a cabo, una revision de casos de exito de dichas aplicaciones en ciudades espanoles. Este trabajo tendra como objetivo mostrar las posibilidades que ofrece la informacion generada por el programa Copernicus, las aplicaciones que actualmente se estan desarrollando y su potencial para el diseno de herramientas que ayuden en el diagnostico y solucion de los complejos problemas que afectan las areas urbanas y territorios adyacentes por la expansion urbana. Finalmente, esta comunicacion ofrece una vision sobre desarrollos tecnologicos emergentes en este contexto como el uso de Big Data e Inteligencia Artificial en datos satelitales. EnglishCities in Europe and globally are dealing with a context of profound socio-economic and environmental challenges. They are an important source of emissions and environmental 139 pressures, but, at the same time, suffer from the consequences of pollution and environmental degradation as well as the effects of climate change. As a response, this situation requires mitigation and adaptation policy-making, based on scientific evidence and complex technical proposals, such as nature-based solutions, to improve air quality or prevent flooding and heat waves. The scientific evidence is based on data collection and analysis. The homogeneous and standardized collection of data is a technological challenge that face many public authorities in times of scarce resources. Different solutions of data collection, analysis and synthesis from Earth Observation have been developed to ease this situation. Particularly, Copernicus, the European Space Programme, offers a wealth of satellite data and thematic services for this context with a free and open data policy. The communication will present different Copernicus applications that help to support policy making in the context of climate change mitigation and adaptation, and of the development of healthy cities. It will summarize the Copernicus services Climate Change (C3S), Atmosphere (CAMS) and Land (CLMS) that are available to public and private users to create applications and sustainable technological solutions, as well as a revision of best practices of these applications in Spanish Cities. The paper aims at showing the possibilities that are provided by these data and services currently available in Copernicus, the applications that are being developed and their potential to design applications that help in the analysis to find solutions to the complex problems urban areas, urban sprawl and the surrounding territories are facing.

These maps typically highlight campus features and some even provide tours. One way to locate campus sustainability maps is through a resource-sharing platform such as the Campus Sustainability Hub provided by the Association for The Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education (AASHE) (AASHE, n.d.). The resources in this hub include both maps posted by institutions and conference presentations about those maps. Maps may also be accessible via an Internet search.To help with the process of designing our map, we conducted a two-part Internet search for campus sustainability maps. Our first search targeted institutions with similar enrollments, endowments, building space, and laboratory space—our peer institutions for the University of Wisconsin–Madison. Using data submitted in the Sustainability Tracking, Assessment and Rating System (STARS) reports (STARS, n.d.), we identified about two dozen peers, many of them state universities such as ours. Our second search was broader and by necessity, non-exhaustive. We browsed through the maps of another few dozen institutions with the intention of expanding our knowledge of what was out there.From our searches, the maps of three institutions caught our attention: University of Washington (UW), George Mason University (GMU), and Cornell University (Cornell). The UW map was designed with layers organized by color and with sub-layer icons that depict the features (University of Washington, n.d.). The GMU map includes a social sustainability layer with campus features relating to well-being, food security, and gender identity (George Mason University, n.d.). The Cornell map includes ways for the public to appreciate nature, for example, a sustainable landscape trail (Cornell University, n.d.).More generally in our review, we observed that the content of all the maps was largely environmental or economic, such as features related to buildings, infrastructure, energy, green spaces, public transportation, or recycling. These features were highly visible because these maps include organizational categories, labeled as layers. In contrast, less visible were features relating to social sustainability. Admittedly, social features are difficult to map in that they may be programs, events, or campus initiatives. Even so, we did find several examples connecting to social justice, diversity, and equity, including campus centers such as the Black Student Union and the Rainbow Room at St. Mary's College of Maryland (St. Mary's College of Maryland, n.d.) and community amenities such as public WiFi and public libraries around The University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (Open Green Map, n.d.).Sustainability ApplyingSustainability is defined in many ways, one of which is to name its three dimensions: economic, environmental, and social. For example, sustainability aims to ""create and maintain conditions, under which humans and nature can exist in productive harmony, that permit fulfilling the social, economic, and other requirements of present and future generations"" (U.S. Department of Energy, 1970). Given the deep human history of the land on which UW–Madison is situated, as well as the current campus activities of diversity, inclusion, and equity, we worked to make social sustainability features highly visible on our map.Our research also pointed us toward the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). (See Figure 1.) The SDGs build upon the issues addressed in the Millennium Development Goals and approach sustainability from social, economic, and environmental dimensions (United Nations, 2015). Thus, the SDGs appeared an ideal starting point from which to organize our map. Others point out that the SDGs offer a ""well-rounded angle from which to approach sustainability within learning and teaching"" (Willats et al., 2018, p. 64).Figure 1. United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (United Nations, n.d.)Our research turned up no campus sustainability maps with the SDGs as an organizing principle. However, we found several institutions that had connected the SDGs to teaching, learning, and research. A two-part project at Yale University's Office of Sustainability demonstrated the alignment of teaching and research with the SDGs and connected them to the work of higher education institutions (Goodall & Moore, 2019). Furman University offers an undergraduate course in which students develop a story map that they draw from ""global models of sustainability,"" such as the SDGs. Students analyze how sustainability principles impact a chosen location, thus encouraging them to connect the SDGs to local policies (Quinn et al., 2019). Instructors at the University of British Columbia are using the SDGs as a thematic framework for their introductory chemistry courses, reporting that the ""SDG framework has been effective in promoting affective learning with regard to the relevance and societal importance of chemistry and in helping maintain student interest and engagement"" (Petillion et al., 2019).In addition, we found that professional organizations and disciplinary societies are using the SDGs. AASHE now features the SDGs in the most recent version of the STARS Technical Manual (ver. 2.2) in which the SDGs are ""integrated and mapped to STARS subcategories and credits"" (STARS, 2019). The American Chemical Society and the German Chemical Society partnered in 2020 to advance the SDGs, noting that ""chemistry plays an essential role in helping society achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)"" (American Chemical Society, n.d.).At this point, with a strong desire to include social sustainability and with a credible basis on which to organize the map, we were ready to begin the design process.Design of the MapThe design process entailed multiple decisions including choosing the interface, selecting and organizing the features, and the choosing the artwork. Each decision was complicated, so we relied on the advice of experts: a guide from the University of Michigan (Shriberg, 2011) and Mapping for a Sustainable World (Kraak et al., 2020).Choice of interfaceMap interfaces offered both advantages and disadvantages. We chose Google My Maps (Google.com, n.d.) because of its straightforward editing capabilities, its familiar interface to the general public, and its availability at no cost. This interface allows up to 10,000 features that can be sorted in 10 layers, with a maximum of 2,000 features in a layer. However, My Maps predetermines many of the map elements, limiting the options of the designer.Selection of featuresFeatures are the heart of a map and its smallest unit. Our greatest challenge was deciding which features to include, and, of course, which to exclude. To be placed on the map, we decided that a feature must: Connect to economic, environmental, or social sustainabilityInvolve our students, staff, and/or facultyMaintain an uncluttered mapInclude a website where viewers could be directedConnect to one or more of the SDGsIn addition, we allowed features to be either physical (e.g., a building) or nonphysical (e.g., a program or event). Our decision to include nonphysical features necessitated compromise. For example, in considering how to place sustainability-related courses on our map, we recognized that we could not create a feature for each of the 60-plus academic departments that offered a sustainability course. Instead, we created a feature in the Quality and Accessible Education layer for the sustainability course attribute that our campus instituted in 2019. This feature links to a webpage that identifies all courses that carry the sustainability attribute (University of Wisconsin–Madison, 2019).Although we strived for completeness, we recognized that a map is never finished. As a result, we included information on how viewers could suggest the addition of new features.Organization of featuresWe needed to name the 10 layers in a way that would be helpful to our viewers. Our first attempt was informed by our research of existing maps, and we proposed Energy, Transportation, Buildings and Infrastructure, Academics, Student Engagement, Housing and Dining, Social Sustainability, Green Spaces, Wellness, and Waste Reduction. Although a useful first step, this organizational scheme appeared to us both arbitrary and unsystematic, so we then turned to the SDGs.Number of featuresSome features are located in more than one place. For example, our campus has dozens of sustainability-related student organizations. Similarly, we located dozens of stormwater best management practices. Clearly, the map would become crowded if we were to include all instances of a given feature. So whenever possible, we chose a single location of a feature and included a link to a website that listed additional locations.Choice of artworkThe design and color of each icon required our attention. Ideally, an icon needed to be 1.) easily associated with its sub-layer, and 2.) readily distinguished from icons of other sub-layers. Although we had hoped to draw upon pre-existing logos from our campus Office of Sustainability, these were too detailed to serve as icons. So we utilized a collection that offered many graphics (Noun Project, n.d.). For color definitions, we used those from the SDG Guidelines (United Nations, 2020).Choice of photographsWe sought a photograph to accompany each feature. Helpfully, Google Maps automatically provides publicly available photographs for each location that it recognizes. Also conveniently, these photographs are paired with a street address or other location data. However, not every location has an accompanying photograph, so we had to find and add ones wherever possible. Furthermore, some of the accompanying photographs did not match our features. For example, the automatic photograph for the feature Low Flow Toilet Retrofits (Bradley Residence Hall) showed the building itself, not the toilets. In this case and in others like it, we added a photograph (with photograph credit) taken during the project.Choice of LayersThe maximum allowable number of layers in My Maps is 10, but there are 17 SDGs that we wanted to employ as layers. Because of the layer limit, only some SDGs could stand alone while others needed to be combined. We placed six SDGs in their own layer, sometimes modifying the name of the SDG to better match our campus features. If changed, the layer name is shown in parentheses.Goal 4: Quality Education (Quality and Accessible Education)Goal 7: Affordable and Clean EnergyGoal 9: Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure (Innovative Design and Infrastructure)Goal 12: Responsible Consumption and Production (Waste and Responsible Consumption)Goal 13: Climate ActionGoal 15: Life on Land (Habitats, Gardens, and Preserves)We assigned some SDGs their own layer either because the SDG had sufficient representative features or because we wanted to give prominence to a specific SDG. For example, we chose to place Goal 13: Climate Action in its own layer to emphasize the importance of climate action and to make visible that it was an area for potential development for our institution.By necessity, some SDGs were paired with other SDGs. For example, three SDGs were combined to fit within the Equity and Justice layer: Goal 10: Reduced Inequalities; Goal 16: Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions; and Goal 5: Gender Equality. Another example is the Healthy Lives layer, which combines Goal 3: Good Health and Well-Being, Goal 2: Zero Hunger, Goal 1: No Poverty, and Goal 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth.Although it was easy for us to find campus features related to mental and physical health targets of Goal 3, it was difficult to find more than a handful of features related to Goal 2, Goal 1, and Goal 8. These represent additional areas of potential growth for our institution.Case Study: The Map in the ClassroomAfter publishing the campus sustainability map on our Office of Sustainability website (University of Wisconsin–Madison, 2021), we were eager to see the map used as an educational tool. Accordingly, and for proof of concept, the map was integrated into an introductory environmental science course, Environmental Studies/Integrated Liberal Studies 126, Principles of Environmental Science. This course engages students in learning environmental science through site visits (e.g., tours on campus and in the wider community) and laboratory activities about campus sustainability initiatives.With the COVID-19 public health crisis, the teaching team for the course needed an alternative for an existing hands-on assignment. Since the map provides a virtual resource for students to investigate campus sustainability, an assignment was created that put its features to use. This assignment had multiple parts, some of which involved exploring the map itself and others that had students visiting features shown on the map (as social distancing permitted). In part of the assignment, students identified and reflected upon map features that connected to social sustainability. The map proved to be an ideal fit with existing course content, and the teaching team is working to more fully integrate social sustainability into the curriculum.DiscussionAs might be expected, the campus sustainability map raised more questions than it answered. The following questions concern our mapping process.How useful was Google My Maps?We found Google My Maps to be a great mapping tool, as it is well-known, easy to edit, and easy to use. However, it had a few attributes that we could not modify, for example, the 10-layer limitation. Additionally, the icons for features in My Maps do not change size when the user zooms the map in or out. Finally, in places where multiple features were located at the same physical address, My Maps overlapped these features, making them hard to see.How useful were the SDGs as an organizing principle?For several reasons, we found the SDGs to be highly useful. First, they are a recognized set of categories with international standing. Second, they provided us with a rationale for which features to include. Third, they are extraordinarily well vetted and articulated in great detail.Although the sustainability practices and projects on our campus were not designed with the SDGs in mind, we readily found connections. However, the SDGs were not a perfect fit. The SDGs have an international focus, and we chose a local focus that would include only features on our campus. For example, Goal 14: Life Below Water focuses on the oceans, seas, and marine resources. As our university is located in a state with a Great Lakes coastline, we paired Goal 14 with Goal 6: Clean Water and Sanitation, in a layer focused broadly on water resources.What comes next?A map is likely to be out-of-date the moment it is published. Thus, we will need to monitor the map, adding features, editing text, and updating website links. We anticipate that new map features will include tours currently in the planning stage, such as those of green infrastructure and cultural landmarks.Ideally, we would want to obtain data about the map users, both who they are and which features most interest them. It is possible to collect data about users' viewing habits from the Office of Sustainability. My Maps tracks and displays the total number of times the map has been viewed. It is also possible to collect data about users' viewing habits from the Office of Sustainability. For example, the Office of Sustainability could add an optional survey on its webpage to gather data about users. If the data reveals users who are new to campus or to sustainability, we could tailor a future map for these audiences. Such a map could contain additional background information on campus features to convey the introductory principles of sustainability.We also want to promote the campus sustainability map as an instructional tool, both in and out of the classroom. For example, we could contact instructors who are teaching courses that are designated as sustainability-related (University of Wisconsin–Madison, 2019) and suggest activities for including the map. We also could introduce the map to new student interns at the Office of Sustainability, providing a walking tour to accompany the map. Finally, the map could be used each summer during new student orientation to introduce both students and their parents to sustainability-related features, again providing a walking tour on campus.""Mapping the SDGs is one of the many ways to share our insights and perspectives—to help us talk to one another as global citizens—and such conversation has no end date or finish line"" (Kraak et al., 2020, p. 121). Our map will continue to grow, as will our campus commitment to sustainability. We provide this roadmap of our journey to those currently designing or updating their own sustainability maps, and we invite collaboration.AcknowledgmentsWe thank our colleagues at the UW–Madison Office of Sustainability for their support in developing a campus sustainability map.

The book describes the environmental collapse that has the potential to occur anywhere between 10,000 and 100,000 years from now due to radioactive waste, glaciations, population shifts, and other changes. The future often patterns after the past, the book warns, as it helps readers delve into future-thinking from different angles.Avoiding serious climate consequences requires human action now. The author notes that people have a difficult time understanding how climate change will affect the planet and people in just the next decade, making it that much harder to think about that far into the future. To help bridge that gap, the book describes two crises: the Anthropocene, our current geological age, which has been influenced by a human-caused deterioration of the environment and disrespect for science and experts; and the second crisis, derived from the deteriorating consequences of the first crisis. In each chapter, the author guides readers to imagine future worlds. He discusses the power of analogy, pattern-making, shifting perspectives, and human mortality.Winning the Green New Deal: Why We Must, How We CanVarshini Prakash and Guido Girgenti, editorsSimon & Schuster, $18https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Winning-the-Green-New-Deal/Varshini-Prakash/9781982142438A collection of essays by experts leading the Green New Deal movement, this book offers a detailed playbook for how to achieve its goals to decarbonize the United States economy and avoid a climate catastrophe.The authors indicate the Green New Deal, a governing agenda, is the “last, best hope for a livable future.”The book is divided into three parts. The first covers current crises, including the need to confront inequality and racism. That includes raising awareness of severe weather events associated with climate change as well as equality in the right to clean water and economic security. The economic power the fossil fuel industry holds will also need to be confronted.The second part focuses on the Green New Deal's visions and policies, beginning with how they came about, the principles on which they are based, the economic case for instituting them, and more. The final part discusses organizing to win the Green New Deal as a piece of legislation, taking a look at people power and political power, protests, and voting in supportive candidates. Making the Green New Deal's goals a reality will prove difficult and require movements to determine what is politically possible while dodging opposition. However, the editors consider winning a Green New Deal a possibility, calling it a “common sense solution.”Solved: How the World's Great Cities Are Fixing the Climate CrisisDavid MillerUniversity of Toronto Press, $29.95https://utorontopress.com/us/solved-3Cities must take action against climate change, according to Solved, which highlights how cities the world over, large and small, are reducing their carbon footprints. Los Angeles, New York, Toronto, Oslo, Shenzhen, and Sydney are leading the way in creating a more sustainable Earth by reducing emissions.Author David Miller, a former mayor of Toronto, debunks the criticism that addressing climate change hurts the economy, maintaining that the real cost is inaction, as severe weather continues to take a toll on cities, insurers, businesses, and citizens. By acting on climate, cities become healthier and more livable. Actions to address climate change also must include the needs of low-income people.As the world becomes increasingly urban, cities have more power to effect change. They already have the power to create and maintain green spaces, to allow construction of homes or businesses, to support public transportation, and to maintain water and waste services.Chapters delve into energy and electricity, new and existing buildings, public and other transportation, and waste management and recycling. The book offers a guide for policy makers and outlines ways for concerned citizens to play a role.Reports2020 Sustainable Campus IndexThe Association for the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher EducationAvailable as a free download at: https://www.aashe.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/SCI_2020.pdfThe Association for the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education (AASHE), the collaborating society to Sustainability and Climate Change, released its 2020 Sustainable Campus Index, recognizing top-performing colleges and universities in 17 sustainability areas and by institution type. Sustainability areas are measured by the Sustainability Tracking, Assessment & Rating System (STARS), a voluntary framework.Some highlights from the 2020 Sustainable Campus Index are as follows: Arizona State University's doctoral program in Tempe, and Colby College (Waterville, ME), received 100 percent scores for Air and Climate. Arizona State also was tops in Investment & Finance.The doctoral program at the University of California, Merced, was the top performer in the Buildings category.Three institutions tied for the top spot in Campus Engagement with 100 percent: Berea College (Berea, KY); Cornell University's doctoral program (Ithaca, NY); and the doctoral program at University of Connecticut (UC) in Storrs. UC also received top ranking for Public Engagement.Two Canadian universities tied for first place in Coordination & Planning: the master's program at Thompson Rivers University (Kamloops, BC), and the University of Alberta's doctoral program (Edmonton, AB).Colorado State University's doctoral program (Fort Collins) took the top spot in Curriculum.Stanford University, CA, ranked first for Diversity & Affordability.The master's program at Thompson Rivers University also came in first for Energy, and the master's program at the University of Winnipeg (Manitoba), ranked first in Food & Dining.The Grounds category had a three-way tie for first place: the associate program at Cascadia College (Bothell, WA); the master's program at Chatham University (Pittsburgh, PA); and George Washington University's doctoral program.Dalhousie University's doctoral program (Halifax, NS) ranked first for Purchasing.The doctoral program at Columbia University (New York City) earned the top spot for Transportation.Nova Scotia Community College (Halifax, NS) ranked first for Waste.The doctoral program at the University of Massachusetts, Lowell, was first for Wellbeing & Work.For more details and to see the full Index, visit:https://www.aashe.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/SCI_2020.pdfThe Time Has Come: KPMG Survey of Sustainability Reporting 2020KPMG ImpactAvailable as a free download at: https://home.kpmg/xx/en/home/insights/2020/11/the-time-has-come-survey-of-sustainability-reporting.htmlThis 11th edition of the KPMG sustainability reporting survey investigates global trends in sustainability reporting and insights for business leaders and others. The report looks at 5,200 companies in 52 countries and jurisdictions, across a range of industries.The survey found 96 percent of the 250 largest companies in the world report about their sustainability performance, and all together, 80 percent reported, up from 12 percent in 1993 when the first report was published. Nearly three-quarters of the largest businesses, 73 percent, use the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards for reporting sustainability impacts.The 2020 survey focused on three aspects of sustainability reporting: risks of biodiversity loss, climate-related risks, and the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Findings include: fewer than 25 percent of companies report risks from biodiversity loss; about 40 percent identify climate change as a financial risk; and reports tend to prioritize SDGs associated with climate change, economic growth, and responsible consumption.Climate Risk and Real Estate: Emerging Practices for Market AssessmentUrban Land Institute and HeitmanAvailable as a free download at: https://knowledge.uli.org/en/Reports/Research%20Reports/2020/-/media/b81db4bbc77845f7834f24b0e974dd7a.ashxClimate risk has become a core real estate issue, influencing investors' and investment managers' decisions, according to this report based on interviews with industry leaders. Concerns include more frequent and severe storms, wildfires, rising sea levels, heat waves, and droughts.Investors understand that local governments are taking measures to build resilience. Those investments in infrastructure, policy, and decision making based on science will help protect those communities. Many cities are calling on new technologies to increase their resilience, and some are working with the private sector.Most investors seek more sophisticated measures to assess climate risk. They want to know about physical risks at the asset and market level; cities' investments in resilient infrastructure; the ability of local governments to fund resilience policies and implement such policies; and the ripple effects of lenders, employers, and other people's sentiments.Some investors are already shying away from putting money into markets most vulnerable to the effects of climate change, and that increases the stakes for local governments, which must protect vulnerable people and properties.Next steps for the real estate industry include developing strategies to determine the level of market-level climate risk and resilience; connecting physical risk assessments to market-scale analysis; considering the role the real estate industry plays in resilience initiatives; collaborating with policy makers; and facilitating teamwork that includes partnering with others.FilmsUnbreathable: The Fight for Healthy AirMaggie Burnette Stogner, filmmakerNew Day Films, 30 minutesStreaming onlinehttps://www.unbreathable.org/Fifty years ago, the United States passed the Clean Air Act.

These dramatic changes, however, have not been without a heavy toll to public health and environmental quality.During summer 2013, I was one of 35 University of Kentucky (UK) faculty members chosen to teach a short course in Shanghai University's International Affairs program. Classes had on average 30 first-year native Chinese students (overwhelmingly male) who had enrolled in courses from a variety of disciplines ranging from poetry, jewelry making, and journalism reporting to global trade and commerce, changing world demographic trends, and geographic shifts in religions. The summer schedule also included a few scientific topics. Mine was focused on urban and water sustainability and featured five videos, focusing on China's major water problems (flooding of the Yellow River, silting behind the Three Gorges Dam, and the South-to-North Water Transfer megaproject).That the PRC continues to struggle with water, land, and air pollution is no secret to environmentalists around the world or to its native population who must deal with its latent risks and invisible dangers. Highlighted in this discussion is a pedagogical assignment I developed and presented in my short course to foster greater environmental consciousness among these students at Shanghai University and later in American classrooms at my university. Growing up in a nation that has undergone mammoth environmental changes—especially in its waterways—from rapid industrial and prodigious technology development in the economic sphere—I believe, has fostered an interesting perspective.The Course and Its Scope and ContentThe course was formally titled, Exploring the Twin Challenges of Mass Urbanization and Water Pollution in China: Toward Sustainability Solutions. Its scope and content were outlined as follows: This 10-hour/1-credit course will explore the complex issues facing China as it pursues sustainable development in its existing and new cities by drawing upon advances in the latest technology and drawing upon Indigenous economic, political, and cultural traditions. The course will also highlight the challenges of and possible solutions for overcoming China's water crisis posed by rapid economic growth and the need for providing potable water to the teeming hundreds of millions inhabiting its urban landscape. These twin course foci and central objectives will encourage native Chinese students to imagine their country's own pathway as an emerging 21st-century superpower and exemplar of urban and water sustainability for the globe's community of nations.Key themes addressed included: learning and unlearning the lessons of Western urbanization and economic development; exploring population strategies for reconciling Chinese urbanization imperatives and rural sustainability needs; examining the range of foreign and Indigenous policy solutions to China's water problems; and instituting innovative sustainability-oriented means for successfully tackling China's formidable water challenges. Built into the course was highlighting the role of Chinese citizen-action groups in promoting policy change to improve water quality and water body remediation (Chen, 1998; Mertha, 2008; Needham, 1971; Polluck & Chen, 1986).The AssignmentWater pollution is a pervasive problem in China and has been one for thousands of years. Noted Western historians of China's environment (Bilsky, 1980; Dogen, 2001; Economy, 2010; Edmonds, 1994; Elvin, 2006; Marks, 2017; Shapiro, 2001; Smil, 1984) have reached back to antiquity to uncover the many social, geographical, agricultural, industrial, political, and even technological sources of deterioration of China's waterways taking the form of pollution, flooding, silting, overuse, and evaporation. Less than a month before the course commenced, Shanghai's Huangpu River, which bisects old Shanghai or Puxi (the city's historic center) from new Shanghai or Pudong (the city's new finance, trade, and commercial center), became polluted with thousands of diseased pig carcasses that had been dumped upstream by farmers in neighboring Zhejian Province (Buckley & Piao, 2016; Wong, 2013).Because I learned at the first class that many of the students lived with their families in rural villages and towns in agricultural regions experiencing urban-industrial changes, I decided to gauge student awareness of the salience of water in their young lives and of those changes coming to agricultural communities. So, during the second half of the course, I assigned them the task of putting together a PowerPoint presentation over the long weekend of the summer semester. Their presentations could be light on text and more heavily weighted with photos from family and community lives. (Chinese college students, I was told by the associate director of my university's teaching and learning center who hosted sophomore-level Chinese students for a two-week workshop, were strong on visual literacy, less so on English literacy.) The presentations only needed to include 10 PowerPoint slides, but were required to convey in words and visuals how water (streams, lakes, rivers) affected their growth and consciousness over their 18 or so years of life and what caused any changes in those waterways.I discovered after announcing the assignment that there was some confusion over how to structure the water autobiography. As a result, I developed an example of my own water autobiography. For a senior American professor in political science, the observations and results of my reading and evaluation of these student PowerPoints were both informative and to some extent surprising in comparison with my experience and knowledge of environmental awareness of American and Canadian students that I had taught over 40 years in North American classrooms.The Students' Water Autobiographies: Observations and FindingsI was uncertain, but hopeful, that the water autobiographies would yield some interesting observations and noteworthy findings. After all, water has played such a significant part in China's environmental history since antiquity (Elvin, 2006; Marks, 2017), and water has been a revered part of China's three major religions (Grumbine, 2010; Miller, 2017). After reviewing and assessing the assignments, I discovered that the pedagogical intent of the class assignment—assessing their ability to articulate their environmental consciousness and uncovering their intellectual growth or continuing ignorance of causes of China's water pollution—was largely achieved by most of the students.Among the major observations were these: A strong attachment to the land and water bodies near family property or the surrounding area. Because so many of the students' families lived in small rural villages, they often expressed deep regard for agricultural land and the waterways in the vicinity. With frequently lovely photographs, many of the students highlighted the farmland and critical importance water played in their parents' or grandparents' livelihoods.Demonstration of the value of water bodies for personal and family leisure (fishing, swimming, boating, commercial entertainment). Streams and rivers were remembered by at least half of the students as a means by which they or their families would enjoy the pleasures of leisure activities as they were growing up. Such nostalgic memories were for the most part simply that—thoughts of a bygone phase in their early growth and development that had passed with high school. Now college was drawing them away and replacing leisure with the demands of higher education and preparation for adult work life and the thrills of the urban setting of university education and campus social life and culture.A rising expectation that clean water would be a part of their adult years after graduating from college and establishing a professional career and middle-class existence. Having been accepted to a major Chinese university and sensitive to pressures exerted by their parents and extended families to achieve academic success, the students anticipated entering a well-paying profession that would allow them a life with all the elements of middle-class status—including associated creature comforts like the enjoyment of clean water from the tap.In addition to these observations, my review and appraisal of the student PowerPoint presentations revealed two surprising findings:1.A lack of a collective dimension to their emerging environmental consciousness. Although a few of the student assignments mentioned the hope that water remediation would benefit their families who were living on farms or in small towns or villages, none really treated water pollution as a collective problem to be overcome for the common good. It is possible that the student-focused manner in which the water autobiography assignment was posed may explain this lapse. Still, it seems surprising that in a culture and political system where collectivist values are so deeply embedded, this dimension received so little emphasis.2.Toleration of the persistence and pervasiveness of water, land, and air contamination across the PRC attributed to the Chinese Communist Party's (CCP) guidance by the “laws of scientific development.” Whatever sorrow or pathos expressed by these Chinese students in this assignment, rationalizations for continuation of the industrial factories polluting their former swimming holes or fishing lakes or drinking water were commonly ascribed to the scientific foundations of breakneck economic development, which was the stated policy priority of their national party leaders. These rationales often repeated state policy that emphasized China as being “factory to the world,” export and trade leader, innovative modern science and technology driver, and emerging large-scale domestic urban consumer market. As one student stated in subsequent classroom discussion drawing upon his water autobiography, “Our leaders have explained that the ‘laws of scientific development’ require that China achieve economic development first before our environment can be cleaned up.”This student's commentary aligns with the theories propounded by Western development experts (e.g., prominent 1960s economist, Walt Rostow, and his stages of economic growth) (Rostow, 1960), although the development literature has shifted significantly since the sixties and presently encompasses sustainability. Further, while some see Chinese communism as assimilating the utopian illusions and Promethean myths growing out of the Western Enlightenment (Li & Shapiro, 2020), others (Bergman, 2021; Pan, 2015) see the CCP drive to advance modern science and technology as stemming from a massive effort to refound Chinese Communist ideology and socioeconomic development upon a more sure footing in the latest innovations in cutting-edge science (e.g., artificial intelligence (AI), quantum information, integrated circuits, life and health, brain science, bioengineered breeding, aerospace technology, deep earth and deep sea exploration).The Pedagogical Uses of Water/Environmental AutobiographiesFor me, the teaching value of the water autobiography in my Shanghai University summer course is compelling—and replicable. For one thing, it demonstrated the merits of mobilizing Chinese students' strong visual literacy skills while maintaining due modesty with respect to the command of English by these first-year college students. Having come to the study of Chinese environmentalism and sustainability late in my career, I have no real Chinese language facility and, as an English-speaking teacher, I must acknowledge the implicit demands I easily placed upon these young Chinese students. Moreover, when I taught a similar course at Shantou University to predominantly fourth-year students, I found their English language proficiency quite high, allowing for more engaged classroom discussion and greater use of active learning techniques.Second, the assignment also had the effect of taking course themes and topics to the personal and interpersonal level, encouraging these budding college students to connect to their life experiences and kindle greater and more meaningful on-the-ground and in-the-water environmental consciousness—one of the major course goals. Thirdly, it served as a springboard for enlarging the pedagogical technique to frame the environmental autobiography as a stimulus in other courses I regularly taught at the University of Kentucky's College of Arts and Sciences Environmental and Sustainability Studies Program. Here there were strikingly different results, perhaps attributable to the United States' more deeply rooted environmental and conservationist movements, greater number of membership-driven environmental groups operating in civil society, and more extensive environmental regulations and laws populating federal and state governments (Sternfeld, 2017).I daresay that the water or environmental autobiography as a teaching tool could be incorporated into a host of courses in undergraduate education in the United States and in other countries by American faculty or Indigenous scholar-teachers. The outcomes and virtues of its use will likely differ, but I believe it could serve as a valuable aid to evoking latent to overt consciousness about the connections between humankind and nature.Faculty in philosophy, political science, psychology, agricultural science, architecture, and ecological economics could all differentially benefit in employing this technique in ways that deepen and widen their disciplines' treatment of environmentalism and elevate student mindfulness about nature and environment, our earthly host and benefactor. From conversations among members of the UK Environmental and Sustainability Studies major program since 2013, I garnered three general strategies for applying the environmental autobiography to courses and curricula in various academic departments and programs: 1.) adapt this technique to particular courses to assay the character of environmental consciousness among students; 2.) convert this technique into a series of questions about factors shaping levels of student awareness regarding the impact of the environment upon their lives, and using this instrument as part of college or major entrance and exit interviews to evaluate changes over the course of their college years or major; and 3.) utilize the technique for students to construct water/environmental biographies of celebrated personages within specific disciplines whose environmental consciousness has developed during their careers.More specific ways that this pedagogical technique could be integrated into a variety of disciplines include:In English literature courses, instructors could not only deploy the environmental autobiography to evoke narrative or poetic tellings of the evolution of student awareness of the complexities of underlying human–nature ties, but assign it in the form of literary biographies for the purpose of tasking their students to explore the sources of the growing maturity of environmental writers like Henry David Thoreau, Walt Whitman, Edward Abbey, Annie Dillard, and so many others. English faculty in my university sustainability and environmental studies major program who already assign works of some of these prominent writers would benefit from their students examining the contexts within which these writers came to environmental consciousness by delving into those key psychological, social, geographical, and familial sources shaping their manner of affection for nature, and tracing the social repercussions of that evolving attachment.In geography, professors have many examples of major theorists whose lives have made observable evolution from environmental theorizing to ecological thought. The environmental autobiography pedagogy can be incorporated to further the understanding of the environmental odysseys of well-known social theorists like Julian Agyeman, Julie Sze, or geographer David Harvey. In their writings, each reveals notable facets of their individual biographies and their intellectual and environmental development (e.g., Agyeman, 2013; Alkon & Agyeman, 2011; Harvey, 2017; Sze, 2015).Agricultural science instructors of students from farming families in the first- or second semester courses meeting general education requirements might use the environmental autobiography as a tool for describing attachment to the land and farming. It could also function as an exemplar for the continuation of rural values, and neo-traditional farming as an enduring feature of environmental consciousness and ecological thought. Kentucky novelist, poet laureate, and essayist Wendell Berry (2015, 2019) would be an excellent candidate for this pedagogical device. His writings serve as a challenge to the industrialization of agriculture and the crucial role of food production as the provisioning facet of urban sustainability (Yanarella & Levine, 2011, 2020).Sustainable architecture courses might employ this technique to encourage students to generate a more encompassing notion of sustainability, one that joins the defining building, transportation, and energy-efficient components of the city with the food-production, environmentally sensitive, and appropriate tech requirements of the modern farming countryside. The assignment could be incorporated in discussion of the inspiration and inclusion of nature observed in the life and architectural practice of Frank Lloyd Wright (Secrest, 1998; Wright, 2005), the architectural historian Dolores Hayden (1979, 2002), and environmental designer and architect Pamela Burton (2010).Courses in colleges and departments of forestry could apply the environmental autobiography to introductory courses to motivate students to explore their developing consciousness of the ecosystem character of forests and the aesthetic and practical dimensions of forests and forest products for sustainable living. The scientific studies and biographies of forestry scientists Suzanne Simard (2021) and Peter Wohlleben (2016) would make excellent subjects for forestry students to undertake as an assignment adapted from this pedagogical aid. The environmental autobiography would spotlight the evolution of their research and life experiences in crystallizing their uncovering of the hidden life of trees.Finally, the writings of journalists like Elizabeth Kolbert (2015a, 2015b, 2021), scientists like James Hansen (2009), eco-humanists like Bill McKibben (2010), and even science fiction novelist Kim Stanley Robinson (2020) would be fair game for using a variation on this technique in a variety of social sciences, humanities, and even natural sciences. Once pondered creatively and duly recontextualized, the possibilities for application from high school to graduate school are many—and should be pedagogically rewarding.ConclusionThe breakneck pace of double-digit economic growth by the PRC has led to a new normal of 6 to 9 percent annual growth in the last ten years (Mirzayev, 2020). This “new normal” period has prompted a focus on sustainable development highlighted by the building of eco-cities and a turn toward environmental mitigation and repair (Deng & Cheshmehzangi, 2018; Fu & Zhang, 2021; Liu et al., 2017; Williams, 2017). Expressive of its campaign to go green has been a series of national policy moves that embedded the goal of ecological responsibility into the national constitution (Li & Shapiro, 2020; Pan, 2015; Yanarella & Levine, 2020).Although China's concept of ecological civilization can be traced back 2,500 years in the philosophy of Daoism, its formal enunciation and political acceptance by Chinese high-level leaders came in 2007 at the 17th Congress of the Communist Party of China. There, Hu Jintao (2007) charged China in a report to construct an ecological civilization designed to bring about “an energy and resource efficient, environmentally friendly structure of industries, pattern of growth, and mode of consumption” (cited in Pan, 2015, p. 35). Then, at the 18th Congress, five years later, President Hu Jintao took the further step of calling the national party congress to write into the party's constitution the national goal of “ecological civilization construction” (Pan, 2015, p. 35). Two years later, its new president, Xi Jinping (cited in Lent, 2018) reinforced his predecessor's commitment to building an ecological civilization upon the foundations of a new development paradigm as a responsibility of the party–state to succeeding generations, sustainability, economic prosperity, and nature.On the international and domestic fronts, China has also seized a global leadership position in solar energy and green transportation while generating a quarter of the world's hydropower, becoming a leader in solar panel production, and moving aggressively to forge ahead in the construction of electric vehicles (Fitzgerald, 2020, pp. 171-172, 179-180). Using mercantilist policies and technological vigor, China has severely undercut the United States' fledgling programs to make strides in solar, wind, and other greenovating policy arenas by a host of illegal economic and trade policies (Fitzgerald, 2020, p. 168). Similarly, some of its advances have also disrupted or stymied European nations' goals in building national industries, advancing innovative pilot projects, and generating green jobs to tackle climate change (Fitzgerald, 2020, p. 171).Meanwhile, the pursuit of neoliberal policies by successive presidential administrations in the United States and the tightening grip of big money in politics abetted by rising wealth and income inequality has hobbled earlier strides in environmental protection despite America's more deeply entrenched environmental organizations traced back to the turn of the 20th century (Merchant, 2011; Warren, 2003). With its policies of rampant exploitation of the country's natural resources, continued urban sprawl in the face of smart growth, and the halt in construction of America's already feeble sustainable city programs, the Trump administration's tight hold on the Republican party effectively ceded to the People's Republic of China a clear path to challenging the United States' hegemonic position in the world and leading the world community in confronting the climate crisis (Thompson & Wong, 2020, ch. 4).What these comparative trends will mean for the objective of raising environmental consciousness envisaged by the pedagogy of the environmental autobiography as a motivation for concerted political and social action is unknown In a post-pandemic world, China's commitment to renewing its ambition to model its urban development on strong and vibrant eco-cities and transforming itself into a truly ecological civilization is a massive undertaking whose success depends on generating mass enthusiasm, support, and participation of its 1.4 billion inhabitants—including new generations of its high school and college students.The party–state's commitment to institutional security and longevity will likely mean persistent monitoring and control of bottom-up initiatives to protect the environment since they might threaten one-party rule and social stability. No less, in the era beyond the coronavirus epidemic, the United States, too, must renew its century-old legacies of environmental conservation and preservation and, despite national economic weaknesses and pandemic-led unemployment, mobilize the power and wherewithal to reassert its dedication to a sustainable future and deepen its fealty to racial and environmental justice. As historical sociologist Barrington Moore Jr. (1966) has argued, genuine revolution of the type needed to achieve a sustainable world and to quell the climate crisis can only come from fusion of top-down and bottom-up forces.AcknowledgmentsSpecial thanks to the faculty of the University of Kentucky's Environmental and Sustainability Studies major and minor programs for their discussions with me about the applicability of the environmental autobiography to their courses and disciplinary contexts. I would also like to express my deep gratitude to the University of Kentucky's Confucius Institute—and especially to its director, Dr. Huajing Maske—for financial support that allowed me to begin my teaching and research activities in the latter part of my academic career focused on China's environmental history and the politics of urban sustainability at Shanghai University in 2013 and 2014 and at Shantou University in 2015 and 2016. Thanks, too, to Chinese history scholar and former Shantou University's College of Liberal Arts Dean Terry Bodenhorn. He and I paired our respective courses (his Chinese Environmental History and my Prospects for Urban Sustainability in Shantou). This coupling allowed us to teach the same students and actively engage with each other as teacher and student in each other's classes and shared field trips, a source of my introduction to the vicissitudes of Chinese environmental history. No less and most especially, I want to extend my sincere appreciation to my Chinese students for what they taught me.Funding InformationNo funding was directly provided for this article.Author Disclosure StatementNo competing financial interests exist.ReferencesAgyeman , J.

rayyan-210793707,Simulation of Early Warning Indicators of Urban Expansion Derived from Machine Learning,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Rapid urbanization has brought along with it many environmental and social problems such as ecosystem damage and traffic congestion. Therefore, forecasting the trend of urban expansion and providing a reasonable urban planning basis for government departments have become the focus of researchers. An artificial neural network (ANN) can be used to consider spatial nonstationarity when obtaining the changing characteristics of urban land types. Therefore, in this study, we use cellular automata (CA) based on ANN (ANN-CA) to simulate and forecast urban expansion and discuss the parameter sensitivity of the model in detail. In addition, we propose a new Urban Expansion Early Warning Indicator system to warn about the deterioration of future land distribution patterns. Chengdu is selected as the study area, and the study period is from 2000 to 2020. The results showed the following: (1) The best accuracy was achieved when the neighborhood size is 7 × 7 and the number of model iterations is 250, and overall accuracy (OA), Kappa coefficient, and figure of merit (FOM) are 91.47%, 0.855, and 0.354, respectively; (2) ANN-CA is more suitable for predicting the urban expansion of Chengdu than CA based on logistic regression (LR-CA) and CA based on decision tree (DT-CA). Compared with the worst performance model, the score of OA increased by 6.23%, that of kappa increased by 0.062, and that of FOM increased by 0.056. (3) According to the current development trend, artificial built-up areas will increase substantially. The comprehensive evaluation results of the morphology effect, ecological effect, and intensity effect of urban expansion predict severe early warning for Jinniu District, Qingyang District, and Wuhou District by 2030.","",https://doi.org/10.1061/jupddm.upeng-4127,"",,
rayyan-210793762,The Simulation and Prediction of Land Surface Temperature Based on SCP and CA-ANN Models Using Remote Sensing Data: A Case Study of Lahore,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Over the last two decades, urban growth has become a major issue in Lahore, accelerating land surface temperature (LST) rise. The present study focused on estimating the current situation and simulating the future LST patterns in Lahore using remote sensing data and machine learning models. The semi-automated classification model was applied for the estimation of LST from 2000 to 2020. Then, the cellular automata-artificial neural networks (CA-ANN) module was implemented to predict future LST patterns for 2030 and 2040, respectively. Our research findings revealed that an average of 2.8 °C of land surface temperature has increased, with a mean LST value from 37.25 °C to 40.10 °C in Lahore during the last two decades from 2000 to 2020. Moreover, keeping CA-ANN simulations for land surface temperature, an increase of 2.2 °C is projected through 2040, and mean LST values will be increased from 40.1 °C to 42.31 °C by 2040. The CA-ANN model was validated for future LST simulation with an overall Kappa value of 0.82 and 86.2% of correctness for the years 2030 and 2040 using modules for land-use change evaluation. The study also indicates that land surface temperature is an important factor in environmental changes. Therefore, it is suggested that future urban planning should focus on urban rooftop plantations and vegetation conservation to minimize land surface temperature increases in Lahore.","",https://doi.org/10.14358/pers.22-00071r2,"",,
rayyan-210793816,Development of a Physics-Guided Neural Network Model for Effective Urban Flood Management,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Urban flooding is a common disaster occurring every year, leading to the loss of lives and properties throughout the world. Its frequency and severity have increased over the years and are expected to increase further due to climate change impacts. Therefore, a robust urban flood management framework is needed to mitigate and/or lessen the adverse impacts of urban floods, which requires flood models capable of quickly producing accurate flood forecasts at key locations in an urban area. Previous attempts at urban flood modeling have focused on the use of physics-based rainfall-runoff models or data-driven models in isolation, with reasonable accuracy. In this study, a novel physics-guided neural network modeling approach is proposed that is capable of exploiting the advantages of both the physics-based and data-driven techniques. We employed the MIKE FLOOD model as the physics-based rainfall-runoff model and artificial neural networks (ANNs) as the data-driven technique in this study. The climatic, hydrologic, and physiographic data derived from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kanpur, a small urban area in Northern India, were employed to develop and test the proposed models and methodologies. The results obtained in this study demonstrated that both the MIKE FLOOD and ANN models employed in this study were able to represent the rainfall-runoff behavior of IIT Kanpur catchment very well. The performance of the ANN models was found to be better than that of the MIKE FLOOD models based on the performance evaluation measures considered in this study. A close examination of the results around the peak of the flood hydrographs revealed that all the models presented here performed much better around the flood peak than in the rest of the flood hydrograph, which is an encouraging result. It was found that the ANNs are powerful tools capable of producing accurate flood forecasts quickly under extreme weather conditions, and therefore they can be employed as surrogate models to achieve greater efficiency in urban flood management activities.","",https://doi.org/10.1061/(asce)he.1943-5584.0002196,"",,
rayyan-210793847,A hybrid scale to relate natural and built environments: a pragmatic approach to sustainable cities,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Urbanization is an irreversible and dynamic process which affects the availability and quality of ecosystem services (ESs). The link between balanced urban growth and ESs is critical for sustainable urban development. The study followed pluralist approach for evaluating and comparing the land-cover-based economic assessment of sustainable, moderately sustainable, and unsustainable cities. The artificial intelligence-based future land cover changes were evaluated using geographic future land use simulation software with geographic information system. A case-specific modification of value coefficients for computing ecosystem service value (ESV) was applied on case cities. A workable scale was developed by exploring relation of ESs and built-up of three extreme cases. The scale has different combinations of ESs and built-up from worst to best scenario with related ESV changes for optimal utilization of land. The scale helped to assess the spatial resource and natural capital balance of any area. The results showed that the ideal ratio of ESs and built-up density range for balanced sustainable development is between 1.35 and 3.64 with ESVs between INR 10.00 million/hectare and INR 8.45 million/hectare, respectively. On applying the scale, the results showed that only 25% of the city peripheral area comes under ideal range. The study will help urban planners in conservation of ESs with economic development for promoting sustainable urban development.","",https://doi.org/10.1080/13504509.2022.2123410,"",,
rayyan-210793998,Urban utopia or pipe dream? Examining Chinese-invested smart city development in Southeast Asia,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"AbstractWith increasing public–private partnership and international cooperation in smart city development across the Global South, Chinese firms are poised to take advantage of growing business opportunities, a situation that few studies have examined. This empirical case study of the Forest City, a Chinese-invested greenfield smart city project in Iskandar Malaysia, begins to fill that gap. This megaproject represents the coming together of overlapping economic development interests of the local authorities and the profit motivations of the Chinese investor. However, the project’s use of the ‘smart city’ discourse contrasts with the reality of limited technology adoption. Its visibility and considerable socio-economic and environmental impacts also sparked opposition from affected local stakeholders and criticism from political leaders. This prompted the Chinese investor to change business practices and enhance corporate social responsibility (CSR) efforts to mitigate risks and ensure project continuity, yet their effectiveness is limited. The study confirms the underlying tensions in the smart city discourse, where economic development and profit imperatives risk running counter to social and environmental sustainability. It also contributes to scholarly understanding of Chinese overseas investments, illustrating the host country’s agency and how better Chinese CSR practices offer the potential for risk mitigation.Keywords: Smart citysustainable developmentforeign direct investmentChinaMalaysiaurban megaprojects Disclosure statementNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the authors.Notes1 Malaysia’s Multimedia Super Corridor (MSC) was established in 1996 as a high-tech business district linking the Petronas Twin Towers in downtown Kuala Lumpur with the international airport, modelled on California’s Silicon Valley.

rayyan-210794090,Agent-Based Modeling for Integrated Urban Water Management,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Comprehensive integrated urban water management (IUWM) framework opens the more holistic path for urban level management. Researchers came forward with water resource management framework considering quantity and quality of water resource, use pattern, wastewater generation, and its reuse, but this framework was limited to water supply and wastewater infrastructures i.e., the physical characteristics of urban water cycle. However, the inter-dependencies, complexities and uncertainties of the water environments made the problem unsolved due to unavailability of generic model or any single sufficient method to address the issues of urban water sub-basin. Therefore, urban water sustainability can be seen as a rigorous complex computational task for which artificial intelligence approaches may play a vital role to establish inter-relationship among various measures within the frameworks. Agent-based modelling may be a game changer in water development for existing and future water related activities in an urban setup. ABMs have potential to model water stakeholders and their interactions based on their authorities and behavioural rules with complexities of the system. As a result, an agent-based IUWM framework including UN-SDG-6, with complex behavioural rules and environmental uncertainties may be an efficient approach to achieve sustainable urban water management.","",https://doi.org/10.1201/9781003203445-15,"",,
rayyan-210794112,Technology Application in the Asian Tourism Industry: Artificial Intelligence and Blockchain in Smart City Involvement,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Tourism is playing a vital role by contributing toward city's economies, business opportunities, and employment particularly in restaurant and retail sectors. In order to meet the expectations of today's travelers, smart city projects have been placed to enhance the travelers' experiences. The core concepts of smart city's infrastructure bring benefits for the tourism industry. Smart cities have been regarded as better places to live with enhanced networking, improved transportation, predictive crime prevention, crowd analytics, and green technology. Many researchers argue that by employing Information and Communication Technologies, smart cities are improving the citizens' life quality, local economy, traffic management, transport, and environment which can enhance the travelers' experiences in any country. Because of the relevance of smart cities to several stakeholders and advantages and challenges related to its implementation, the smart cities' concept has attracted the significant attention of scholars from multiple fields. This chapter is intended to describe the features of smart city and its advantages for tourists. This chapter provides implications for tourism industry of Asian countries through the involvement of smart city. It also discusses how new technologies such as Internet of Things, artificial intelligence (AI), and blockchain enhance the overall urban planning and contribute to building smarter smart cities. Improvement of services in tourism industry such as logistics, ticketing, and lodging requires real-time analysis of data from Internet of Everything. We also present and discuss the co-relationship between smart cities and sustainable tourism and the challenges faced such as crowd management, congestion, quality of services, and environment, infrastructure, and cities resilience to human and natural disasters.","",https://doi.org/10.1007/978-981-16-2210-6_23,"",,

These agro-ecosystem services also provide significant economic benefits to people and the socio-economic development of a country. However, the sustainability of agro-ecosystem services is threatened by climate change and variability. Agro-ecosystem models have been recognized as a potential tool to understand the interaction between climate and other components of an agro-ecosystem and identify the best management practices for sustainable management of the system. This chapter presents the application of the agro-ecosystem models to simulate some of the water-regulating agro-ecosystem services under climate change scenarios in India. Simulation models have been successfully applied for the infiltration, groundwater recharge, evapotranspiration, evaporation, runoff, water storage, and soil erosion as the water-regulating agro-ecosystem services. The application of various infiltration models developed in India has effectively been demonstrated for both constant and variable depth of water for a variety of soils. A large variation in potential groundwater recharge both in time and space has been recorded for the soybean [ Glycine max (L.) Merr.] cropping system under different soils using the HYDRUS-1D model. Simulated potential groundwater recharge from water harvesting structures (WHS) by the integrated potential groundwater recharge simulation (IPGRS) model ranged from 83.0 to 90.2% of the accumulated surface runoff in the WHS. Different hydrological models, such as the Precipitation Runoff Modeling Systems (PRMS), and the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) have been applied successfully to various river basins of India for modeling climate change impact on water resources. Simulation of soil erosion—using the revised universal soil loss equation (RUSLE) model under HADCM3 model simulated climate change scenarios under SRES A2 emission scenarios—showed an increase in soil erosion from 58 to 59% for the different land-use systems with an increase of 58% in annual rainfall during the 2080s (2071–2099). Simulation studies conducted on some water-regulating agro-ecosystem services using hydrological models with different climate change projections and downscaling approaches showed varied hydrological responses of land-use systems and river basins in agro-ecosystems of India to the future climate change scenarios. In conclusion, these agro-ecosystem modeling applications tested in the semi-arid region of India can be extended to other agro-ecological regions of the world for better understanding and quantifying water-regulating agro-ecosystem services.

The main objective of this study is to prepare the flood susceptibility maps using GIS-based Frequency ratio (FR) and Information Values (IV) models. Based on Google Earth imagery and filed survey, 168 flooding locations were identified and classified randomly into training flood locations datasets 70% (118) and the remaining 30% (50) of flooding locations datasets were used for validation purpose. Identified 12, flood conditioning factors like slope, elevation, aspect, and curvature, TWI, NDVI, distance from road, distance from river, soil texture, lithology, land use and rainfall were integrated with training flood points to determine the weights of each flood location conditioning factor and factor classes using both frequency ratio and information value models. The flood susceptibility maps were produced by overlay the weights of all the flood conditioning factors using raster calculator of the spatial analyst tool in ArcGIS 10.4. The final flood susceptibility maps were reclassified as very low, low, moderate, high and very high susceptibility classes both FR and IV models. This susceptibility maps were validated using flood location area under the curve (AUC). The results of AUC accuracy models showed that the success rates of the FR and IV models were 0.829 and 0.821, while the prediction rates were 0.807 and 0.800 respectively. The outcome of this paper will help decision-makers for land use planning and also assist in the implementation of effective mitigation strategies to mitigate future damage in this study area.

However, degradation of soils and health problems can result from the addition of sewage sludge leading to chemical contamination if inadequately managed, in order to monitor the long-term interactions between soil and sludge, a study was conducted in the field over a period of two years in a Mediterranean climate for two soil textures: soil A (clay) and soil B (sandy). The results showed that all parameters studied changed significantly in a dose-dependent manner (p < 0.05) for both soils compared to the untreated control soils, all investigated treatments showed significant increase in their organic matter (OM), TOC, N, P and K content. Indeed, there was a dose-dependent manner for amended soils. The heavy metals and major elements were determined by microwave plasma Atomic Emission Spectrometry (MPAES). This study revealed a progressively increased content of heavy metals concentration which goes down in the following order: Cu > Pb > Zn > Ni> Cd> Cr. Nevertheless, we noticed that their concentrations were below the critical values established by the European Union for the agronomic use of soil. Moreover, principal component analysis (PCA) was applied as a practical tool to determine the influencing factors regarding the transfer of heavy metals in amended soils. The degree of pollution and associated risks that may be caused by these metals has been evaluated based on the geo-accumulation index (Igeo), the contamination factor (CF), the pollution load index (PLI) and Potential ecological risk (PER) suggested the application of sewage sludge. Globally, the PLI and PER index result showed a law to a moderate contamination risk of heavy metals.

rayyan-210794305,Geospatial Techniques to Quantify Urban Change,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Rapid urbanization is threating the security of resources due to increasing demand. The influx of people into urban areas is causing changes to urban landscapes, as well as resulting in high unemployment and crime rates, pollution and urban sprawl. In addition, urban landscapes are encroaching and disturbing ecological infrastructure. Changes in the built-up area in Harare, Zimbabwe, between 1986 and 2018, were quantified using multispectral remote sensing. Land-use classification was done using Landsat images (urban and non-urban areas) using the random forest machine learning classifier. The developed land-use images were overlaid on population maps to compare urban growth with population increase. The influence of urban growth on climate change was assessed through an analysis of the changes in land surface temperature (LST), which was derived from a transect of different Landsat images over the review period. There are notable spatio-temporal, demographic and environmental transformations evidenced by the increasing urban population, land-use changes and rising temperatures. The built environment increased by more than 185 per cent between 1986 and 2018, at a rate of more than 5 per cent per annum. There were positive trends in landscape metrics, with the number of patches decreasing from 20,877 to 9,865. Significant increase in LST occurred due to the increase of impervious surfaces.","",https://doi.org/10.1201/9781003224624-13,"",,
rayyan-210794394,Subdomain Style Compensation Network for Remote Sensing Cross-Domain Scene Classification,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"High spatial resolution (HSR) imagery scene classification has been the subject of increased interest in recent years, and has great potential for many applications, such as urban planning and land cover classification. Deeping learning has been widely exploited in scene classification and achieved high classification accuracy. However, current the scene classification method based on deep learning depends on a large number of datasets for training, and the feature distribution of the default testing datasets is the same as that of the training datasets. In practical application, it is not only time-consuming and laborious to obtain a large number of training data, but also difficult to meet these needs due to the data shift between different domain. In addition, directly use of features extracted by the convolutional neural network (CNN) will lead to limited performance owing to the influence of domain migration. Therefore, how to effectively reduce the domain offset between the training data and the testing data, and discover discriminative information to scene classification is a challenging task. In this paper, the SSCN is proposed for HSR remote Sensing cross-domain scene classification. In SSCN, we introduce DSAN in which the local maximum mean discrepancy (LMMD) is first introduced for scene classification to capture the fine-grained information for each category and reduce the domain migration between training data and testing data. To extract more discriminative information from HSR images, a style normalization and restitution module (SNR) is developed, and an attention mechanism is added to the module to improve the performance of the model. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed SSCN framework is superior to the state-of-the-art methods <sup xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"">1</sup> and performs well for cross-domain scene classification.","",https://doi.org/10.1109/igarss46834.2022.9884646,"",,
rayyan-210794404,floodGAN &amp;#8211; A deep learning-based model for rapid urban flood forecasting,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Recent urban flood events revealed how severe and fast the impacts of heavy rainfall can be. Pluvial floods pose an increasing risk to communities worldwide due to ongoing urbanization and changes in climate patterns. Still, pluvial flood warnings are limited to meteorological forecasts or water level monitoring which are insufficient to warn people against the local and terrain-specific flood risks. Therefore, rapid flood models are essential to implement effective and robust early warning systems to mitigate the risk of pluvial flooding. Although hydrodynamic (HD) models are state-of-the-art for simulation pluvial flood hazards, the required computation times are too long for real-time applications.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In order to overcome the computation time bottleneck of HD models, the deep learning model floodGAN has been developed. FloodGAN combines two adversarial Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) that are trained on high-resolution rainfall-flood data generated from rainfall generators and HD models. FloodGAN translates the flood forecasting problem into an image-to-image translation task whereby the model learns the non-linear spatial relationships of rainfall and hydraulic data. Thus, it directly translates spatially distributed rainfall forecasts into detailed hazard maps within seconds. Next to the inundation depth, the model can predict the velocities and time periods of hydraulic peaks of an upcoming rainfall event. Due to its image-translation approach, the floodGAN model can be applied for large areas and can be run on standard computer systems, fulfilling the tasks of fast and practical flood warning systems.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;To evaluate the accuracy and generalization capabilities of the floodGAN model, numerous performance tests were performed using synthetic rainfall events as well as a past heavy rainfall event of 2018. Therefore, the city of Aachen was used as a case study. Performance tests demonstrated a speedup factor of 10&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;6&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; compared to HD models while maintaining high model quality and accuracy and good generalization capabilities for highly variable rainfall events. Improvements can be obtained by integrating recurrent neural network architectures and training with temporal rainfall series to forecast the dynamics of the flooding processes.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu22-4730,"",,
