As part of the celebration, GEN editors invited a host of researchers, executives, analysts and commentators to give their highlights of the most exciting developments in biotechnology over the past four decades and their hopes and predictions for the future.As we launch GEN Biotechnology, we present here a selection of these fascinating and insightful offerings from leading scientists, biotech executives, financial analysts and other commentators. Their views on biotech's evolution span everything from spatial genomics to vaccine development to synthetic biology. A recurring theme was the need for greater equity in access to the next wave of the biotech revolution—something on which we can all agree.– The EditorsThese quotes have been edited for length and clarity. See the full compilation of testimonials in the 40th anniversary issue of GEN (October 2021).Gbola Amusa, MDPartner and CSO, ChardanImproving Global OutcomesDriven by biotech, the biopharma industry has increasingly moved away from a kind of industrial serendipity associated with less‐targeted small‐molecule drugs toward rationally designed and sometimes transformative biotech therapeutics relying on understood biology. Such innovations are relevant even at a societal level, as seen with COVID‐19 vaccines. The future of biotech will be defined by genetic medicines, cell therapies, and tissue engineering in fields such as neuroscience, cardiovascular disease, oncology, and transplantation.Let's not forget that with the advent of biosimilars and local production of biotech products, the promise of biotech is increasingly a factor for improved healthcare outcomes globally, and not just in the wealthiest countries. Benefits will also be broadly shared if technologies such as gene editing find nontherapeutic and globally relevant applications in fields such as biofuels and food safety.Frances H. Arnold, PhDProfessor of Chemical Engineering, Biochemistry, and Bioengineering, California Institute of Technology; Nobel Laureate 2020Protein DesignIn 40 years, we've transitioned from “everything is hard” to being able to read, write, and edit any DNA we want. We still can't compose the code for new function terribly well, however, but progress is being made. Structure prediction experienced a giant leap thanks to machine learning, and we can expect similar leaps in prediction of function and protein generation/design. I want to see biology do her beautiful work for us, in the form of DNA‐encoded chemical factories, molecular machines, materials, therapies, recycling systems, nutrition, and so much more.Joseph M. Beechem, PhDCSO and Senior VP, Research and Development, NanoString TechnologiesBeyond Next‐Gen SequencingThe most amazing aspect of watching the life sciences over the past 40 years is seeing that every few years, everything changes. After the Human Genome Project, the life sciences went from cottage industry to big science. Then outlooks broadened, becoming less DNA‐centric. RNA was recognized as the dynamic cell marker to measure, especially with the introduction of single‐cell methods and spatial transcriptomics. Spatially resolved multi‐omics will be transformative. It may even eclipse next‐generation sequencing in importance.I think it is now beyond question that the continued development of advanced life sciences technologies holds the key to solving the planet's most pressing problems—disease, hunger, climate change.Charles CathlinCEO & Co‐Founder, Polaris GenomicsImproving Mental HealthIf the pandemic is an earthquake, the mental health fallout we're facing is a tsunami. Vaccines are saving lives, but there's no vaccine to protect us from the mental health repercussions that will far outlast the virus itself. The pandemic has underscored the urgency for biotech companies to develop novel solutions that will propel mental and behavioral healthcare into the 21st century… At the junction of precision medicine and behavioral health, our vision is to reduce suicide, stigma, and suffering.Charmaine Chan, PhDInvestment Principal, Cambiar InvestorsHealthcare Access and PricingBiotech has gone through multiple S‐curve evolutions and is likely on the steepening phase of another compressed cycle, given fundamental advances in how we query biology aided by the sheer amount of computational power and rapid data generation. We are likely to make great strides in the application of biotech not only to medicines but also to agriculture, materials science, and manufacturing. However, biotech with respect to healthcare does not exist in a vacuum, as these products are 1) subjected to a high regulatory bar, 2) nondiscretionary, and 3) transitioned into public goods after an exclusivity period. These have led to peculiar push‐pull dynamics in how these goods are priced, access‐gated, and paid for, and how returns on investments are generated for investors. If this biotech S‐curve is to reach its full potential, the public debate on whether healthcare is a right or a privilege must be more granular, guidance in development of novel therapies streamlined, and incentives for innovators/healthcare providers better aligned with costs/benefits for patients.“…the public debate on whether healthcare is a right or a privilege must be more granular, guidance in development of novel therapies streamlined, and incentives for innovators/healthcare providers better aligned with costs/benefits for patients.”Deanna M. Church, PhDVP, Mammalian Business Area and Software Strategy, InscriptaSensors, Drugs and FactoriesReflecting on the last 40 years of biotech continually brings me back to the “tech.” We have gone from barely being able to read genomes to the promise of writing genomes on a routine basis. Single‐cell analysis, once unthinkable, has become commonplace. The key to widespread adoption has been making the technology easy for anyone to use. Looking to the future, genome engineering and measurement advances in spatial biology promise to provide yet another layer of information that has been missing. Programmable variation coupled with single‐cell readouts will accelerate our ability to interpret genomes, linking genotype to phenotype. We will no longer be limited by evolution. We can create cells to act as cellular medicines, protein factories, or environmental sensors.George Church, PhDProfessor of Genetics, Harvard Medical SchoolExponential Growth, Equal AccessOver the past 40 years of biotech, what stands out are the exponential improvements in reading and writing DNA. In 1981, you might have gotten a 60 base‐pair sequence read for $300. Today, you'd get a high‐clinical‐quality diploid human 6 billion base‐pair genome. The biggest change in the biotech industry has been the expansion from standalone single‐protein products (drugs and enzymes) to complex genomic/cell/organismal system solutions. Recently, exciting developments in the biotechnology industry include gene therapies like Novartis's Zolgensma and mRNA vaccines like Moderna's Spikevax. These are great milestones, illustrating the challenges of orphan drugs and economies of scale ($2.5M and $15 per dose, respectively).Looking to the future, I hope that we keep up the exponentials to enable equitable access to technologies and accompanying know‐how; that we extend the global scale of vaccines to aging‐impacted diseases; that we address the limited scale of rare diseases via affordable preventatives like premarital genetic counseling; and that we develop bioweather maps and channels for zoonotics and resistant variants via real‐time, global, ubiquitous devices.Matthew Cobb, PhDProfessor of Biology, University of Manchester, UK; author ofGenetic DreamsScalability and AvailabilityThe past 40 years have seen genetic engineering lead to astonishing developments in science, medicine, and agriculture. The challenge of the next 40 years will be to ensure that those discoveries—and those to come—benefit the many, not the few. Our ingenuity must be deployed not only to discover new potential therapies, but also to find ways of rendering them simple, safe, and cheap. Potential therapies for sickle‐cell disease are astonishing, but although there are millions of people around the world who suffer from this condition, very few will be able to access treatment because of healthcare inequalities. Genetically modified (GM) crops have spread around the world, but uptake in many countries is poor, partly because the crops that are engineered, and the characteristics they possess, do not suit small‐scale or subsistence farming. It is striking that there are few GM crops that resist diseases rather than pests. Co‐developing solutions to these problems of scalability, appropriateness, and availability is an even greater intellectual challenge than developing some impressive new genetics.“Co‐developing solutions to these problems of scalability, appropriateness, and availability is an even greater intellectual challenge than developing some impressive new genetics.”Brandi Davis‐Dusenbery, PhDChief Scientific Officer, Seven BridgesData Sharing and ReuseOne of the biggest shifts that has long‐term impact for the biotech industry is an overarching evolution of data sharing and reuse, both within organizations as well as between researchers in public and private settings. This is as much a social achievement as a technological one, driven by the recognition that data becomes more powerful when combined with other data. This evolution has been catalyzed by technological advances that streamline the combination of larger and larger multimodal datasets using standardized approaches to drive dramatic value across the drug discovery life cycle. Looking into the future, we believe organizations that can effectively leverage and combine internal data assets with those generated through large‐scale public efforts will drive personalized therapeutics with reduced financial investment and accelerated time to market.Alex Dickinson, PhDFounder and Executive Chairman, ChromaCodeNature's Genomic ToolboxI find one of the most fascinating themes of the last 40 years to be biotech's coöption of natural phenomena to build profoundly useful genomic tools. The era kicked off in 1983 with Kary Mullis recognizing that DNA's innate propensity for self‐replication could be combined with Taq polymerase's freakish natural ability to operate in Yellowstone's hot springs to create PCR, the all‐purpose DNA copier. And now, nearly 40 years later, the technology has proven its remarkable staying power as the backbone of global pandemic mitigation—delivering billions of accurate and cost‐effective diagnoses.Another cycle of natural coöption began in 2012 when Jennifer Doudna and Emmanuelle Charpentier recognized that the CRISPR‐Cas9 bacterial immune mechanism could be used as a tool for in situ genome editing. Recent results indicate that the technique is safe and effective as a human therapy for a rare liver disease—starting no doubt another incredible multidecade cycle of nature‐derived genomic tool innovation in discovery and healthcare.Alec FordCEO, KariusAnti‐Microbial TherapiesIn medicine, genomics applications started in prenatal care, oncology, and organ and cell transplantation. Recently, doctors began using metagenomic testing in routine care to identify multiple infectious pathogens from blood samples. Today, we can take a single blood sample, sequence all the cell‐free DNA, analyze the genomes we detect, and link them to infection‐causing pathogens. This access has changed the way we think about developing treatments, leading to our understanding that one therapeutic may not be suitable for everyone with that disease. It's allowed us to focus instead on identifying those who are more likely to respond to certain approaches. We're learning more about the connection between microbiomes and disease states. We're also learning more about how pathogens learn to evade our existing therapies. This knowledge combined with early detection is going to help prevent and overcome antimicrobial resistance.Timothy Gardner, PhDFounder and CEO, RiffynPredictive BiologyAfter 20 years, synthetic biology remains misunderstood. Most think of it as the imaginative engineering of genetic machines. But the founding papers of synthetic biology from the early 2000s reveal that the field's intent was predictive biology. Its vision was to design, make, and use biological materials and organisms as speedily and as predictably as nonbiological materials. Today, we've barely scratched the surface. Achieving such speed and predictability calls for a step change in experimental quality, advanced measurement systems, and democratization of data science. It will need a technology stack of laboratory technologies that work together with the sort of precision, accuracy, and interchangeability that is seen only in discrete manufacturing.The next revolution in the life sciences will be in predictive biology. It will require advancement in laboratory technologies—and a shift in mindset to one that lauds multivariate assessment of biological and physiological systems as highly as gene editing.Sylvain GarielCo‐Founder and COO, DNA ScriptSynthetic Biology SolutionsSynthetic biology is evolving as the main driver behind innovation in various aspects of everyday life, such as food, clothing, and packaging. Engineered microorganisms can produce a broad range of chemical or biological molecules through fermentation, which can prove more sustainable and economical than conventional methods. Synthetic DNA and RNA have now become critical for a sustainable future.In healthcare, personalized diagnostics and therapeutics will be realized at scale along with personalized oncology. Biotech will contend with other major challenges such as global warming, infectious diseases, food insecurity, and value chain disruptions. Portable and customizable synthetic biology solutions will be key to extending lifespans and sustaining the health of this planet.Birgit GirshickCOO, Charles River LaboratoriesCell and Gene TherapiesThe first gene therapy was approved by the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) in December 2017. As of today, the FDA has approved 22 cell and gene therapy (C&GT) products, and over 15% of the biopharma R&D pipeline is C&GT programs. This accelerated growth is astounding. As the industry invests in this space, we can transform the world of drug development by introducing potentially curative therapies for diseases which have high patient need. The move towards C&GT represents a paradigm shift for patients – bringing the promise of personalized medicine from concept to reality.Debra GoldfarbDirector, Amazon Web Services (AWS)The Need for Equal AccessCOVID‐19 represents the perfect storm to see just how far we have come since April 2003, when the first human genome was sequenced—a seminal accomplishment taking nearly 13 years. For perspective, Moderna designed and shipped the first clinical batch for its coronavirus vaccine in just 42 days. Scientific breakthroughs in understanding biological mechanisms, coupled with powerful tools like cryo‐electron microscopy and massive‐scale cloud computing, have fundamentally changed our ability to understand disease, identify cures, and deliver more targeted therapeutics. As extraordinary as these advances are, the challenges facing humanity demand that the benefits are shared equally and are accessible to everyone, irrespective of where you were born. It is a moral imperative.“…the challenges facing humanity demand that the benefits are shared equally and are accessible to everyone, irrespective of where you were born. It is a moral imperative.”Todd Golub, MDDirector, Broad Institute of MIT and HarvardLong‐Term Transformative ImpactThe biotech industry has done a great job of putting focus, expertise, and financial resources behind early, unproven ideas that can potentially benefit patients. An enormous number of companies have been started on the premise that new platform technologies might revolutionize drug discovery. But too often (perhaps even inevitably), such a “revolution” gives way to financial pressures that understandably force companies to redirect resources to products that have a more immediate return on investment (for example, a drug that is ready for a clinical trial). This often leads to companies abandoning emerging technologies before their potential has been realized. The now‐mature biotech sector needs to figure out how to stop exchanging long‐term transformative impact for short‐term financial gain, otherwise truly innovative approaches to therapeutics will continue to die on the vine.“The now‐mature biotech sector needs to figure out how to stop exchanging long‐term transformative impact for short‐term financial gain.”Barry GreeneCEO, Sage TherapeuticsCNS DisordersThe central nervous system (CNS) space is at a similar inflection point that oncology was 20 years ago, where we are now using new tools like imaging and diagnostics to explore new pathways, brain circuitry, and functionality at the molecular level. Real innovation is occurring in CNS and brain health that will have a potentially meaningful impact on hundreds of millions of people across numerous mood, neurologic, and neuropsychiatric disorders.Rachel Haurwitz, PhDPresident and CEO, Caribou BiosciencesExpanding CRISPR‐based TherapiesAlthough I'm obviously biased, I think that CRISPR genome editing is incredibly exciting, and it has already significantly changed what we can do in the life sciences. First, it has been rolled out as a readily accessible tool in laboratories around the globe, enabling all kinds of important research from agriculture to human disease. Second, it's being explored by many developers for new therapeutic approaches including ex vivo cell therapies as well as in vivo gene therapies. CRISPR genome editing unlocks the potential for a wide range of genetically based therapies for cancer, rare diseases, and many other therapeutic areas. I'm hopeful that the vast potential of genetic approaches to medicine will come to fruition in meaningful ways such that gene and cell therapies are a robust addition to small‐molecule and antibody drugs and result in truly significant outcomes for patients.Molly He, PhDCo‐Founder and CEO, Element BiosciencesAn Accelerating RevolutionReflecting on the last 40 years of biotechnology, I marvel at what's possible. The declining cost of DNA sequencing and the availability of companion technologies for spatial genomics, proteomics, and so much more are improving our collective ability to identify and deploy personalized approaches to disease prevention, detection, and therapy. I'm optimistic that the revolution in biology will only accelerate as new companies seek to build on the technologies and applications available today to open the world of biology to new possibilities.“The revolution in biology will only accelerate as new companies seek to build on the technologies and applications available today to open the world of biology to new possibilities.”Andrew HesselCo‐Founder and Chairman, GP‐write and Chief Exploration Officer, Officinae Bio; co‐author ofThe Genesis MachineA Revolution in EvolutionThe most remarkable shift in biotechnology over the last 40 years has been digitization. It's resulted in R&D done at a speed, cost, and scale that was impossible before. Modern biotech teaches us that life is code—and programmable. We've learned to read, comprehend, and now write life's digital instructions. We can identify, dissect, and understand natural systems at atomic resolution. We can produce biomolecules, systems, and even complete organisms that exist only because we can imagine and engineer them. This is a revolution in evolution, and the trend is clear: natural and artificial selection will be overtaken by biology made with intention. As Stewart Brand noted in 1968, we are as gods and might as well get good at it. I believe we are and we will.Mei Mei Hu, JDCEO, VaxxinityNext‐Gen Vaccine DevelopmentIf there has been a silver lining to the COVID‐19 pandemic, it has been a renaissance in the power of vaccines to keep us healthy. We have also seen that vaccines can be developed at unprecedented speeds to help nations globally find their way back to normalcy, while being affordable, manufacturable at scale, and accessible in all parts of the world. We will see a second wave of vaccines geared to contribute to the longer‐term needs of the COVID‐19 vaccine market, namely, equitable distribution and combating variants of concern. The latter is addressed by at least some ability to boost the immune response of those already vaccinated, depending on the technology used.Bee Luan Khoo, PhDAssistant Professor Biomedical Engineering, City University of Hong KongCancer Modeling and ScreeningThe use of point‐of‐care devices to achieve personalized medicine has always been the focus of our team. With the advancements in miniaturization, it is now possible to integrate devices with different functions, and complex procedures can be realized with the push of a button. With artificial intelligence and smartphone applications to automatically read data, technologies for multimodal detection and management of diseases at home are within reach. Our team is committed to achieving a cost‐effective combination of liquid biopsy and microfluidics technology to provide the possibility of real‐time monitoring of metastasis in a noninvasive and inexpensive way.Emily Leproust, PhDCEO and Co‐Founder, Twist BioscienceVelocity of DiscoveryThe Human Genome Project took 20 years to complete, and even then, more work was needed. However, building on that pivotal project, the speed of biological learning over the last 40 years has been exponential. It's quite the contrast to a discipline like chemistry, where the elements have all been discovered. In biotechnology, the velocity of discovery is increasing, with direct benefit to overall health and sustainability.“In biotechnology, the velocity of discovery is increasing, with direct benefit to overall health and sustainability.”Ivan Liachko, PhDFounder and CEO, Phase GenomicsResearch‐Industry CollaborationI've really enjoyed seeing new genomic tools progress from invention to an accepted norm in society. From the developments of new RNA vaccines and precision cancer treatments to the foods we eat (for example, stronger crops and plant‐based “meat”), biotechnology has prevented famines and has saved millions of lives from a variety of diseases. But we're also seeing another dramatic change—an acceleration of the commercialization of new genomic technologies. Ventures spinning out from academic institutions signal the increased cooperation between research and industry that will greatly benefit humankind's future.Jeanne Loring, PhDProfessor Emeritus, Founding Director, Center for Regenerative Medicine, Scripps ResearchFostering CollaborationOver the last several decades, I've moved from academia to biotech, back to academia, then back to biotech. Now I've reached equilibrium, as both a professor emeritus at a major research institute and the founder of a growing biotechnology company. At the beginning of this journey, I attracted scorn from whatever side I was not on at that moment. It's been a long time since I was last reviled for being too scholarly or too techy, and this is the biggest change I've seen: the growing respect of each side for the other. For 30 years, I've reviewed grant applications for academic and business NIH study sections, always being welcome because I knew the coolest technologies. Over time, I learned about neural development, knockout mice, monoclonals, microarrays, DNA sequencing, human pluripotent stem cells, RNA sequencing, microRNAs, machine learning, epigenetics, single‐cell genomics, and organoids. Without biotechnology companies, these things would have remained hidden in specialized academic laboratories. Biotech is where collaboration really happens.Ted W. Love, MDPresident and CEO, Global Blood TherapeuticsAdvancing Health EquityThe biopharmaceutical industry is making a profound impact as we continue to accelerate medicines that modify disease to extend and improve human lives. Connecting with patient communities allows us to better problem solve, rapidly innovate, and ultimately make the greatest difference. Yet for a field driven by constant innovation and novel approaches, it has taken some time for us to advance health equity. Biopharmaceutical companies are beginning to take the right steps in areas like diversifying our clinical trials and corporate boards, but this is only the beginning. Let's focus our innovation on transforming the lives of the most vulnerable and underserved, such as patients living with sickle‐cell disease. It is our duty to improve health for all people—and this industry can do it.“Let's focus our innovation on transforming the lives of the most vulnerable and underserved,…”Tia Lyles‐WilliamsFounder and CEO, LucasPyePrecision Medicine and GMOsThe pace of innovation in biotechnology has rapidly increased over the past 40 years. We're innovating in our equipment, methodologies, and software technologies to rapidly develop the appropriate paths forward for treating patients with various disease/virus indications. We're expanding our use of genetic materials and our applications of genomic data. We're also continuing to tweak our manufacturing processes, raw material components, and human administration pathways to reduce risks as well as costs for patients.The biggest changes in biotechnology include developments in precision medicine and GMOs, which are bound to influence our longevity, particularly now that increasingly adverse conditions on Earth are threatening to spread disease and hunger. I am hopeful that biotechnology will promote diverse, inclusive, and equitable practices that will benefit all members of the human race—and our animal neighbors, too. These practices will sustain innovation and reduce costs for biotech companies and patients alike.Sandy Macrae, PhDCEO, Sangamo TherapeuticsGenomic MedicineBiotechnology, specifically genomics, is ushering in a new era where there are three primary modes of medicine: prevention through vaccines, treatment with small molecules, and cures through genomic medicine. We'll continue to advance genomic medicine with the care and purposefulness required while pioneering a new field of medicine for patients. Technologies like zinc finger genome engineering enable us to address severe disease at its source on the genome. It puts in reach our goal to create life‐changing or life‐saving medicines for patients suffering from diseases for which existing treatment options are inadequate or don't exist.There are challenges ahead. Improving delivery efficiency is a priority, as is evolving aspects of the healthcare system to accommodate genomic medicine. However, these are surmountable and will not inhibit shifting the treatment of severe diseases from symptom management to lasting cures.“Biotechnology, specifically genomics, is ushering in a new era where there are three primary modes of medicine: prevention through vaccines, treatment with small molecules, and cures through genomic medicine.”Mondher Mahjoubi, MDChairman and CEO, Innate PharmaExciting Times in Immuno‐OncologyFrom precision medicine to next‐generation antibody therapies, the field of cancer treatment has experienced an extraordinary advancement over recent years. This has resulted in an overall improvement in survival rates across a variety of indications. A revolution in immuno‐oncology is still taking place, however, with new approaches that teach the patient's immune system to identify and eradicate cancer cells by preventing them from hiding and by boosting the immune response. There is a renewed interest in tools we might have overlooked in the past, such as natural killer cells, which now we know can act as the “special forces” of the immune system and make a difference in the fight against cancer. I believe we are living in a truly exciting time in the field of immuno‐oncology, bringing us closer to the goal of ending this complex and devastating disease.Christopher E. Mason, PhDProfessor of Physiology and Biophysics, Weill Cornell MedicineA Multitude of GenomesIn 40 years, we've gone from knowing only a handful of genes and no genomes to a dramatically new era with an ever‐erupting fountain of genetics knowledge, now spanning more than 60,000 human genes, millions of other eukaryotic and microbial genes, and millions of reference genomes and genome assemblies. We've sequenced DNA in hospitals and remote villages, as well as in sewers and space stations, to create a genetically quantified and data‐driven world. The next 40 years might involve mapping, engineering, and utilizing genomes not just on Earth, but also, at long last, for the planets and stars we see in the sky at night.“The next 40 years might involve mapping, engineering, and utilizing genomes not just on Earth, but also, at long last, for the planets and stars we see in the sky at night.”Michelle McMurry‐Heath, MD, PhDPresident and CEO, Biotechnology Innovation OrganizationThe Innovation EcosystemForty years ago, the biotechnology industry was in its infancy.

rayyan-210743117,Deep Learning for Plant Species Classification,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Plant species classification is a fundamental task in botany, agriculture, and environmental science, providing valuable insights into biodiversity, ecological systems, and agricultural practices. Botanists and the general public could benefit from an automated system for quickly recognizing plant species. The protection of biodiversity necessitates a better understanding of plant species identification [1]. Traditional methods of plant species identification relying on hand-crafted features can be complex and challenging, especially for non-specialists who have trouble remembering specific botanical words. A potential method has emerged for automatic plant species identification utilizing machine learning and deep learning techniques. Deep learning is effective in extracting features because it excels at giving more detailed information about images. This paper presents the implementation of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), a deep learning-based approach that extracts features from leaf images and facilitates the classification of plant species. Deep learning methods, particularly CNNs, have demonstrated superior performance compared to handcrafted feature-based approaches. The ability of CNNs to automatically learn discriminative features from images has greatly improved the accuracy and efficiency of plant species classification. By leveraging deep learning methods, the proposed approach extracts features directly from leaf images, eliminating the need for manual feature engineering. The CNN architecture captures intricate patterns and structures present in the leaf images, enabling robust classification of plant species. The application of CNNs in plant species classification has yielded significant advancements in the field, providing a reliable tool for both experts and non-experts in identifying plant species. The implementation of CNNs facilitates the extraction of features from leaf images, leading to improved accuracy and efficiency.","",https://doi.org/10.1109/icseiet58677.2023.10303530,"",,
rayyan-210743301,Habitat Prediction and Knowledge Extraction for Marine Bivalves using Machine Learning Techniques,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Species distribution models (SDMs) are powerful tools for analyzing the relationships between species and the environment. SDM results can provide insights into a species' response to a given habitat condition, making it crucial to compare SDMs based on their predictive performance and habitat information. The marine bivalves' habitat has been highly threatened due to anthropogenic activities and natural disturbances and continues to lose their rich biodiversity resources. Protection for these species requires detailed spatial distribution of these habitats such as habitat suitability maps. Three machine learning methods (Maximum Entropy, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models were used to predict the habitat suitability for marine bivalves, comparing their predictive performance and ecological relevance. A spatial modeling approach was used, incorporating 1200 occurrence data points and ten environmental factors. The study used five performance metrics to estimate the accuracy of the habitat suitability models. All of the four SDMs methods showed significant relationship between the marine bivalves distribution and environmental factors. Results indicate that Random Forest (RF) model is the best predictor of potential bivalve habitat, with an area under curve (AUC) value of 0.98 compared to SVM (0.87), MaxEnt (0.97) and ANN (0.87) models. The most important environmental factors that affect the bivalve's distribution in the area were pH, diffuse, and calcite. Finally, a potential area for cultivating the marine bivalves with high and very suitability was suggested based on the RF model.","",https://doi.org/10.1145/3596947.3596964,"",,
rayyan-210743413,Application of GIS and Remote-Sensing Technology in Ecosystem Services and Biodiversity Conservation,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Geographic information systems (GISs) and remote-sensing technologies have become indispensable tools in the fields of ecosystem services assessment and biodiversity conservation. This chapter delves into the various applications and contributions of these technologies, while also addressing current challenges and discussing future prospects. The chapter begins by outlining the fundamental principles of GIS and remote sensing, explaining how these technologies can provide critical data and analytical capabilities for habitat mapping and monitoring, species distribution modeling, and evaluating biodiversity changes. It highlights numerous case studies from different conservation contexts worldwide, demonstrating the versatility and value of these tools in understanding and managing ecosystems and their services. Despite the proven benefits of GIS and remote sensing, the chapter acknowledges the challenges that persist, such as data quality and availability, scale mismatch between ecological processes and remote-sensing data, uncertainty in data and models, and the need for robust validation techniques. Furthermore, the chapter addresses the complexities of integrating social and ecological data to achieve a more holistic understanding of ecosystems and their services. Looking ahead, the chapter discusses the promising future prospects of these technologies, including ongoing advancements in satellite and sensor technology, the integration of big data and machine learning techniques for more efficient data processing and analysis, the growth of citizen science and crowdsourcing initiatives to collect ground-based data, and the increasing importance of interdisciplinary collaboration between ecologists, geographers, and other specialists. The chapter concludes with a call to action for researchers, practitioners, and policymakers to address these challenges and capitalize on emerging opportunities. By doing so, they can further enhance the efficacy of ecosystem services assessment and biodiversity conservation efforts, ultimately contributing to the sustainable management of our planet's precious natural resources.","",https://doi.org/10.1201/9781032646268-12,"",,
rayyan-210743714,"How consistent are citizen science data sources, an exploratory study using free automated image recognition apps for woody plant identification",,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Rapid advances in artificial intelligence have led to an upsurge in automated image recognition phone apps. This has increased public involvement in the collection, identification (ID), and analysis of biological data. While this is good for the field of biological data monitoring and biodiversity conservation, it is not clear how consistent IDs are from different apps. The goal of this exploratory work is to verify the accuracy and consistency in plant species identification from two widely used and free apps, i.e., PlantNet and iNaturalist apps. This work was conducted by scanning leaf samples along Bruce Trail in the Niagara Escarpment Biosphere Reserve as well as from the Royal Botanical Gardens arboretum, both in Hamilton, Ontario. Results show over 90% consistency in the identification of woody plants at the level of genus. At the species level, the PlantNet app demonstrated 79% accuracy (i.e., 79 out of 100 species correctly identified), while the iNaturalist app demonstrated 44% accuracy. Enhancing species representation in the database for Southern Ontario might help particularly species in the families Betulaceae, Rosaceae, and Pinaceae. Complementary use of the apps is recommended as a cautionary measure to reduce the likelihood of error in species-level woody plant identification as well as using apps in conjunction with field guide.","",https://doi.org/10.1139/cjfr-2023-0203,"",,

While our understanding of the general importance of these coral reefs as reservoirs of biodiversity is commonly accepted, attempts at quantifying how many species live in the oceans, or on coral reefs, is a much more complex question to answer. Our best attempts to put concrete numbers on total marine biodiversity have produced wildly discrepant numbers that differ by up to several orders of magnitude, depending on the methodology employed (e.g. compare [2] with [3]). Total coral reef biodiversity is a particularly obtuse problem, due to the inherently complex three-dimensional structure of these reefs [4] (figure 1a). The cracks and crevices of reefs produce space and microenvironments that can harbour multitudes of diverse organisms (figure 1b). Key to these ecosystems are the hermatypic corals themselves, largely zooxanthellate scleractinians (Cnidaria: Hexacorallia: Scleractinia), which via their symbioses with family Symbiodiniaceae zooxanthellae, produce the calcium carbonate structures that form reefs over time.

However, these cnidarian groups have often remained taxonomically recalcitrant due to a myriad of reasons. Especially when viewed in situ or via photographs, coral identification can be a challenge, as microscale-skeletal structures often need to be examined to achieve reliable results. As they are ecosystem engineers, no ecological study of a coral reef is complete without coral abundance or diversity indices of some kind: scientists need to be able to count coral species and abundances effectively and accurately. These indices are the necessary foundation to investigate temporal changes and their causes and consequences. Ecologists can count corals via in situ observations, usually via SCUBA, which comes with a number of limitations, such as inherent risks, logistical effort, availability and accessible water depths. Other options that are becoming increasingly popular include remotely operated underwater vehicles (ROVs) or similar tools [5]. Sampling of coral colonies is another, invasive approach, but this is also time-consuming and damaging to reefs when performed at large scale, as well as limited in nature; one cannot sample every coral colony on a reef, and researchers' time underwater is limited by their air consumption. Alternately, transects or quadrats can generate two-dimensional photographic images that can later be analysed without time constraints [6], but these methods are often limited in resolution and neglect the three-dimensional nature of reefs. Three-dimensional photogrammetry methods solve this problem [7], but require large amounts of both computing power and time, and analyses are still limited to what the observer and their camera can see from above or outside of coral colonies, and cannot yet be applied at the wider scale of coral reefs. Environmental DNA (eDNA) applications therefore are ideal complements to traditional survey methods to increase detection rates and robustness of biodiversity monitoring. eDNA has the potential to non-invasively generate large amounts of marine biodiversity data [8], making it perfect for significantly improving our understanding of coral reef diversity. The first step of conducting an eDNA monitoring endeavour starts with the collection of an environmental medium that acts as source of eDNA. Sources thereby include water samples containing free DNA molecules or even whole organisms, mucus, faecal matter, gut contents or benthic sediment. The selection of source material can already influence the results, as benthic sediments and water samples can return different communities in the analyses, as well as the depth at which water samples were taken. Subsequent steps include processing and storage of the environmental samples, with the general consensus to process the samples as swiftly as possibly to prevent degradation of DNA molecules. Various protocols have been proposed for extracting DNA from environmental samples, but all generally seem to lead to satisfactory levels of DNA quantity and quality. Depending on the marker system used for amplification of the extracted DNA, single species can be focused on, or alternately even a whole community across a wide range of reef taxa with metabarcoding assays. While it may be sufficient to only detect positive PCR signals for single species confirmation, or investigate their abundance using quantitative PCR, DNA metabarcoding extends the principles of conventional molecular barcoding to mixed template samples using next-generation sequencing methods. Depending on the sequencing platform, thousands to millions of sequences are retrieved, which then need to undergo bioinformatic analyses. There are several potential ways described to process these sequences; all include quality filtering steps to exclude low quality, short, or erroneous reads. The result of the bioinformatic metabarcoding analyses usually consists of a list of sequences from all samples, which can then be compared with reference databases, resulting in a list of taxa that reflects the observed biodiversity of the eDNA sampling approach [8]. These results from eDNA studies have already helped to detect invasive, rare and cryptic species, as well as designate bioindicator species. On subtropical and tropical coral reefs, several eDNA studies have been already conducted, investigating coral diversity or even whole coral reef communities. Results so far indicate that eDNA applications can potentially be used to quantify coral cover, identify community differences within a reef system (e.g. lagoon versus reef slope), differentiate between communities along an anthropogenic stress gradient, as well as elucidate temporal patterns of coral spawning events [9–12]. The study of Nishitsuji et al. [13] demonstrates the successful large-scale use of eDNA to illuminate the scleractinian coral diversity around an entire island, Okinawa Island, southern Japan. The authors collected and examined eDNA from more than 60 locations around Okinawa Island, amplified mitochondrial marker sequences (12S ribosomal DNA) using a recently developed primer set [14] and compared their results with observations by divers at the same sites. Importantly, while both datasets were generally comparable, with similar results across sites, the eDNA dataset included more detected coral genera than the divers, and this was supported in statistical analyses. As well, the eDNA dataset included the first molecular records of at least two coral species or genera around Okinawa Island. Records and distributions form the bases of biodiversity data, and it is clear eDNA can contribute to enriching such important databases, highlighted by the detection of species not previously reported from the reefs of Okinawa. Additionally, the eDNA and diver-based datasets matched at approximately two-thirds of the sites, and at least a partial match was achieved at 91% of sites, cross-validating each method. However, which dataset should be followed when datasets do not match, as seen in two of the sites in Nishitsuji et al. [13]? This is a difficult question, and one that eDNA methodologies need to overcome. Is a diver-based assessment more reliable, perhaps due to varying primer sensitivity or mismatches [15]? Or are the eDNA data more reliable, revealing what the human diver eye cannot see? Given that most scleractinian corals should be relatively visible to the diving ecologist's eyes, it is probably very rare for eDNA methods to generate data for a coral that cannot be found with repeated focused dives. It should be noted this situation may not be applicable for other taxa that are smaller, more cryptic, or microbial. Thus, more investigation into comparisons between visual and eDNA datasets for a variety of taxa are needed to raise the reputation of eDNA methodologies for lay ecologists, as are the generation of more and different eDNA primer sets for corals or other targeted taxa. Given the exponentially increasing amount of genetic information available for marine taxa, such goals should be relatively easy to achieve and will also lay the foundation for research projects into the future. Finally, Nishitsuji et al.'s research is a welcome focus on the coral reefs of Okinawa and southern Japan [13]. It has long been recognized that the coral reefs in this region are not only comparably endemic and diverse, but also under high levels of threat due to their comparatively small area and rising anthropogenic pressures [16]. eDNA surveys and monitoring can help scientists in the region target areas for more in-depth surveys, and document biodiversity changes over time, as the extracted DNA, if stored correctly, can also serve as an archive of the biodiversity at the specific time point of the sampling. As well, amplification with marker systems targeting other marine taxa is still possible with the extracted DNA, which can help further elucidate previously unseen aspects of coral reefs. Furthermore, the successful use of eDNA for the investigation of shallow water reefs shows that this technique also has great potential for the investigation of mesophotic reef systems that are beyond the reach of SCUBA and can only be reached with increased technical effort. Can eDNA methodologies unlock biodiverse mysteries of coral reefs? Not alone. Cutting-edge technologies need a solid foundation, and eDNA is no different. The accuracy of eDNA depends on the accuracy and completeness of baseline data for target taxa, and thus cannot replace specimen-based taxonomy and biodiversity studies, which generate taxonomic frameworks and reference databases. The quality and reliability of eDNA monitoring results are thereby directly related to the quality and quantity of the available reference sequences. This can potentially lead to a large part of sequences recovered, be it amplicon sequence variants (OTUs) or operational taxonomic units (ASVs), that cannot be determined. Simply put, what is not part of a reference database cannot be found in eDNA analyses. In addition, databases may not be up to date with the latest taxonomy or may inadvertently contain incorrect information or misidentifications. These circumstances can lead to wrong taxonomic assignments in eDNA datasets. These problems can be common and often limit the integration potential of visual and eDNA data. In this context, the increasing reliance on eDNA methods in biomonitoring and marine ecology makes collection-based studies and biodiversity collections and well-curated repositories more important than ever, particularly given the rising extinction threats to our biodiversity in the Anthropocene. Scleractinian corals, unlike many marine taxa, represent an ideal group to work with in both visual surveys and with eDNA methodologies, and such studies can serve as templates for other taxa. More visual+eDNA studies similar to Nishitsuji et al. [13] across other taxa will help researchers expand and better integrate such datasets across the Tree of Life in the future. It is clear that eDNA offers massive potential to the future of coral reef ecology. While transects and imagery remain the de facto standard datasets in coral reef ecology, eDNA is being increasingly deployed, and the question as to which methodology paints a 'truer' picture of a reef is an open one. As well, what methodological approach best solves the needs of each study or conservation manager should be considered; often a rough idea of what diversity is present and how it changes in space and time may be enough for the question at hand. Both in situ diver-based and eDNA methods still have questions regarding taxonomic resolution, due to the above-mentioned issues regarding marine biodiversity (many coral reef animals remain undescribed) and taxonomy (scleractinian corals, for example, are undergoing revisions due to difficulties in often clearly delineating species boundaries). Additionally, mtDNA primers as used in Nishitsuji et al. [13] do not delineate to the species level for a range of coral taxa due to the conservative nature of mtDNA in most anthozoans [17], thus limiting potential for monitoring at such fine taxonomic resolution. Finally, as has been demonstrated in many studies [18,19], robust control sampling and measures to prevent contamination are always recommended to increase the reliability of results. Continued efforts to address all of these issues are needed alongside progress in eDNA methodologies. Regardless, eDNA represents a powerful tool for marine ecologists and coral reef science. As Nishitsuji et al. [13] have done, collecting and comparing imagery and eDNA datasets should become the standard for many studies in the near future, and we can envision a future in which eDNA data alone could be recognized as the most representative information of any given coral reef. Combined with imagery acquisition from underwater drones and ROVs [5], and streamlined AI-assisted imagery analyses [6], and the future of coral reef ecology and diversity studies will undoubtedly reveal major new discoveries. Progressive development of eDNA methodologies will lead to increasing incorporation of eDNA into the best practices for marine resource management and monitoring. The paper by Nishitsuji et al. [13] is an important step toward this exciting new future in coral reef ecology. Data accessibility This article has no additional data.

rayyan-210743847,From spectra to functional plant traits: Transferable multi-trait models from heterogeneous and sparse data,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Our understanding of the Earth&amp;#180;s functional biodiversity and its imprint on ecosystem functioning, structure and resilience is still incomplete. Large-scale information on vegetation properties (&amp;#8216;plant traits&amp;#8217;) is critical to assess functional diversity and its role in the Earth system. Such parameters are constantly changing due to variations in environmental conditions which makes extensive in-situ measurements in the field not logistically feasible. The advent of the upcoming space-borne hyperspectral missions will facilitate to map these properties. However, we are still lacking efficient and accurate methods to translate hyperspectral reflectance into large scale information on plant traits across biomes, land cover and sensor types. Yet, the absence of globally representative data sets on reflectance data and the corresponding in-situ measurements represents a bottleneck to develop empirical models for estimating plant traits from hyperspectral reflectance. Recent and ongoing initiatives (e.g. EcoSIS) provide a constantly growing source of hyperspectral data and plant trait observations from different vegetation types and sensors. In this study we integrated 29 data sets including four different ecosystem types spanning from Europe to north America. By combining these heterogeneous data sets, we propose multi-trait models based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) that simultaneously infer multiple plant traits from canopy spectra. We targeted a broad set of structural and chemical traits (n=20) related to light harvesting, growth, propagation and defense (e.g. leaf mass per area, leaf area index, pigments nitrogen, phosphorus). The performance of our multi-trait CNN models predicting these traits was compared to single-trait CNNs as well as single-trait partial least squares regression (PLSR) models. The results of the multi-trait models across a broad range of vegetation types (crops, forest, tundra, grassland, shrubland) and sensor types were promising and outcompeted state-of-the-art PLSR models. We found that the overall prediction performances significantly increased from single- to multi-trait CNN models and those of PLSR models. The key contribution of this study is to highlight the potential of weakly supervised approaches together with Deep Learning to overcome the scarcity of in-situ measurements and take a step forward in creating large-scale maps of Earth&amp;#8217;s biophysical properties with the increase in availability of hyperspectral Earth observation data.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu23-10901,"",,
rayyan-210743862,Enhancing predictive mapping of soil carbon by incorporating vegetation growth dynamic information via deep learning,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"The spatial distribution of soil organic carbon (SOC) serves as critical geographic information for assessing ecosystem services and guides land management for migrating carbon emissions. Digital mapping of SOC is challenging due to the complex relationships between the soil and its environmental conditions. Except for the well-known topography and climate environmental covariates, the aboveground vegetation growth, which interacts with belowground soil carbon, in&amp;#64258;uences SOC signi&amp;#64257;cantly over seasonal and interannual variations. Although several remote-sensing-based vegetation indices (e.g. NDVI and EVI) have been widely adopted in digital soil mapping, variables indicating long-term vegetation growth status have been less used. The vegetation phenology, an indicator of vegetation growth characteristics, can be used as a potential time series environmental covariate for SOC prediction. In this study, a CNN-RNN hybrid model was developed for SOC prediction with inputs of static and dynamic environmental variables in a study area located in Xuancheng City, China. The spatially contextual features in static variables (e.g., topographic variables) were extracted by the convolutional neural network (CNN), while the temporal features in dynamic variables (e.g., vegetation phenology over a long period) were extracted by a recurrent neural network (RNN) as represented by using a long short-term memory (LSTM) network. The ten-year phenological variables before the sampling year derived from satellite-based observations were adopted as new predictors reflecting historical temporal changes in vegetation in addition to the commonly used static variables. The random forest model was used as a reference model for comparison. Our results indicate that adding phenological variables can improve the soil carbon prediction accuracy, and demonstrate that the &amp;#64257;ne-tuned CNN-RNN model is potentially effective and can be a powerful model for SOC predictive mapping. We conclude that the hybrid deep learning models have great potential to enhance soil prediction by simultaneously extracting spatial and temporal latent features from different types of environmental variables, and highlight that using the long-term historical vegetation phenology information can serve as a useful extra input for future applications in the predictive mapping of soil carbon.ReferencesZhang, L., Cai, Y., Huang, H., Li, A., Yang, L., Zhou, C., 2022.

rayyan-210744133,An Automated and Scalable ML Solution for Mapping Invasive Species: the Case of the Australian Tree Fern in Hawaiian Forests,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,Biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation are global challenges demanding creative and scalable solutions. Recent increases in data collection coupled with machine learning have the potential to expand landscape monitoring capabilities. We present a computer vision solution to the problem of identifying invasive species. The Australian Tree Fern (Cyathea cooperi) is a fast growing species that is displacing slower growing native plants across the Hawaiian islands. The Nature Conservancy organization has partnered with Amazon Web Services to develop and test an automated tree fern detection and mapping solution based on imagery collected from fixed wing aircraft. We utilize deep learning to identify tree ferns and map their locations. Distinguishing between invasive and native tree ferns in aerial images is challenging for human experts. We explore techniques such as image embeddings and principal component analysis to assist in the classification. Creating quality training datasets is critical for developing ML solutions. We describe how semi-automated labeling tools can expedite this process. These steps are integrated into an automated cloud native inference pipeline that reduces localization time from weeks to minutes. We further investigate issues encountered when the pipeline is utilized on novel images and a decline in performance relative to the training data is observed. We trace the origin of the problem to a subset of images originating from steep mountain slopes and riverbanks which generate blurring and streaking patterns mistakenly labeled as tree ferns. We propose a preprocessing step based on Haralick texture features which detects and flags images different from the training set. Experimental results show that the proposed method performs well and can potentially enhance the model performance by relabeling and retraining the model iteratively.,"",https://doi.org/10.1109/wacvw58289.2023.00019,"",,
rayyan-210744272,Predicting Plant and Pollinator Diversity in Grasslands from High-Resolution Satellite Imagery,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Measurement and monitoring of biodiversity at large spatial scales are needed to inform conservation, preserve at-risk species and habitats, and safeguard critical ecosystem services. Remote sensing satellites that gather high-resolution imagery with short temporal return periods, coupled with machine learning models, offer the potential to predict diversity and expand the spatial extent of sparse and costly field measurements. Here we evaluate how well Random Forest models analyzing a time series of high-resolution multispectral imagery can predict diversity (quantified as taxonomic richness and Hill’s number) of plants and pollinators in potential bioenergy cropping systems in southwestern Michigan. We trained the model using data from plots in a long-term experimental array and then tested it against data from semi-natural grassland sites across the local landscape. We found that for plot data, the random forest model predicted the richness of plant and pollinator taxa with a high degree of skill. We predicted plant richness with an R2 of 0.83 and RMSE of 4.16 species. When we investigated feature performance for model prediction, images from mid-May (day of year 126-141, during the early emergence of plants) were particularly important, and surface brightness captured by RGB reflectance and vegetation indices strongly differentiated plant richness. The use of time series features was critical for identifying this important observation period; single observation periods at other times of the year provided limited predictive capacity. Scaling of the model to regional grasslands substantially decreased its performance with reduced predictive skill (R2 of 0.22 and RMSE of 6.01). Pollinator diversity was not well predicted by the plot-trained model, suggesting that at landscape scales other factors influence pollinator diversity. Our findings demonstrate the potential of remote sensing, paired with machine learning, to predict plant diversity from field observations and identify features related to meaningful physical phenomena. They also illustrate how training data collected at local scales can produce overfit models that perform poorly when applied to new landscapes, which we view as a limitation that will need to be overcome as progress is made toward using remote sensing to estimate and monitor biodiversity.","",https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4638487,"",,
rayyan-210744300,Towards Automatic Animal Classification in Wildlife Environments for Native Species Monitoring in the Amazon,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Although critical for habitat and species conservation, camera trap image analysis is often manual, time-consuming, and expensive. Thus, automating this process would allow large-scale research on biodiversity hotspots of large conspicuous mammals and bird species. This paper explores the use of deep learning species-level object detection and classification models for this task, using two state-of-the-art architectures, YOLOv5 and Faster R-CNN, for two species: white-lipped peccary and collared peccary. The dataset contains 7,733 images obtained after data augmentation from the Tiputini Biodiversity Station. The models were trained in 70% of the dataset, validated in 20%, and tested in 10% of the available data. The YOLOv5 model proved to be more robust, having lower losses and a higher overall mAP (Mean Average Precision) value than Faster-RCNN. This is one of the first steps towards developing an automated camera trap analysis tool, allowing a large-scale analysis of population and habitat trends to benefit their conservation. The results suggest that hyperparameter fine-tuning would improve our models and allow us to extend this tool to other native species.","",https://doi.org/10.1109/colcaci59285.2023.10226093,"",,
rayyan-210744330,Mapping fish species distributions in River Rhone using environmental DNA and remote sensing,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Biodiversity loss in freshwater river ecosystems is much faster and more severe than in terrestrial systems, and spatial conservation and restoration plans are needed to halt this erosion. Reliable and highly resolved data on the state of and change in biodiversity are critical for effective measures. However, high-resolution biodiversity maps still need to be improved, especially for large riverine systems. Coupling data from the latest global satellite sensors with broad-scale environmental DNA (eDNA) and machine learning could enable fast and precise mapping of the distribution of river organisms. Here, we investigated the potential for combining these methods using a unique fish eDNA data set sampled along the entire length of the Rhone river in Switzerland and France. Using Sentinel 2 and Landsat 8 images, we generated a set of ecological variables describing both the aquatic part (blue) and the surrounding terrestrial landscape of the river (green). We combined these variables with eDNA-based presence and absence data on 29 fish species and used three models to assess environmental suitability for these species. Most models showed good performance, indicating that ecological variables derived from remote sensing can provide valuable information on the ecological determinants of fish species distributions. Variable importance analyses showed that the blue variables (water temperature, water quality, water clarity) had stronger associations than the green variables surrounding the river. The species range mapping indicated a significant transition in the species occupancy along the Rhone, from its source in the Swiss Alps to its outlet into the Mediterranean Sea in southern France. Our study demonstrates the feasibility of combining remote sensing and eDNA to map species distributions in large rivers; this method can be up-scaled to any large river worldwide. Hence, in the future, the approach presented here could be used to predict precise biodiversity distributions in rivers to help design conservation schemes.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu23-1918,"",,
rayyan-210744497,"Effect of invasive alien plant species on chir pine forest understory vegetation composition, diversity and soil properties in the central Himalaya, India",,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Plant invasion has been considered as one of the major threats to biodiversity, soil cycle, ecosystem services and livelihood. In the present study, we have estimated the effect of two invasive alien species, Lantana camara and Ageratina adenophora on the understory vegetation composition, species diversity and soil properties of chir pine (Pinus roxburghii) forests in the central Himalaya. We have selected three sites (Chanfi, Matial and Mehra) in pine forests and each site was divided into three subsites i.e. non-invaded (NI), L. camara invaded (LI) and A. adenophora invaded (AI). In each subsite, 10 random quadrats for herbs (1 &amp;#215;1 m) and shrubs (5 &amp;#215;5 m) were laid down and soil samples were collected seasonally in triplicate from the surface (0&amp;#8211;10 cm) and subsurface (10&amp;#8211;20 and 20&amp;#8211;30 cm) depths. The presence of both the invasive species changed species richness, diversity, evenness and caused a 29&amp;#8211;40% reduction in native understory herbs and shrubs species number. Shrub density and basal area in NI sites (4200&amp;#8211;6960 individual ha-1 and 0.60&amp;#8211;0.96 m2 h-1) were 2&amp;#8211;3 times lower than LI and AI sites. PCA and correlation analysis were conducted to explore the relationship between soil properties, status (invaded and non-invaded) and soil depths. The soil variables were further compared between status and depth using linear mixed-effect model (LMM) and Tukey&amp;#8217;s HSD test. It was found that in LI and AI sites, soil properties such as moisture (Mo), porosity (Po), organic carbon (OC), total nitrogen (N), potassium (K), microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and nitrogen (MBN) were significantly (p &lt;0.05) higher and bulk density (BD) was lower in the surface soil (0&amp;#8211;10 cm) than NI site but the difference was less prominent in subsurface (10&amp;#8211;20 and 20&amp;#8211;30 cm) depths. The results indicated that L. camara and A. adenophora invasion altered vegetation composition and soil properties and develop nutrient-rich substratum which may further promote the invasiveness in chir pine forest. This depletion of native flora and change in soil properties is worrisome for both ecological as well as socio-economical perspectives and needs urgent attention of forest managers and policymakers.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu23-1623,"",,
rayyan-210744532,Preliminary results for dune vegetation identification from high-resolution satellite imagery,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Coastal dunes are important habitats that provide a variety of ecosystem services (ecological, economic, coastal protection, etc.) and, as such, their monitoring is a priority for environmental protection (i.e., EU Directives). Eco-geomorphologic feedbacks between dune plants and coastal topography are fundamental to the self-organisation capacity of coastal dunes and a shift in community structure and composition (i.e., expansion of invasive species) can cause a domino effect, potentially crippling previously established system adaption mechanisms. It follows that monitoring dune vegetation is crucial, especially in protected areas and in fragmented and stressed dune environments. Even though recent improvements in spectral and spatial resolution of satellite imagery open new and exciting prospects for large-scale environmental monitoring, this potential is largely unused in dune ecogeomorphology, due to the challenges related with the small size and density of dune plants and the complexity and heterogeneity of the existing species. Machine learning techniques and subpixel classification methodologies, like the Random Forest Soft Classification (RFSC), have shown promising results in similarly challenging environments in terms of plant size and heterogeneity, with high accuracies in subpixel fractional abundance of marsh-vegetation species. Even though subpixel classification could improve monitoring biodiversity from satellite imagery, similar approaches have never been tested for dune environments. These challenges and gaps inspired the present work, built around the idea of testing subpixel classification methods for dune plant species identification using high-resolution satellite imagery. Here we present preliminary results from the application of RFSC to the western barrier of the Ria Formosa system (S. Portugal) using WorldView2 (2017) imagery and training/validation samples from UAV, along with the next steps planned to test the hypothesis that RFSC methods can be successfully used to identify dune plant species and to assess their predictive capacity and identify potential limitations.&amp;#160;Acknowledgements: The work was implemented in the framework of the DEVISE project (2022.06615.PTDC), funded by FCT (Funda&amp;#231;&amp;#227;o para a Ci&amp;#234;ncia e a Tecnologia) Portugal.

rayyan-210744618,Creating the tools to conserve wildlife,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"The recent increase in public and academic interest in preserving biodiversity has led to the growth of the field of conservation technology. Conservation technology involves the construction of technology and tools and interfacing them to aid in the conservation of wildlife through collaborations or technology interventions. Creating the tools to conserve both fauna and flora is incredibly challenging and can be toxic if not approached with specific ideas in mind. In this talk, I will present some foundational framework for developing conservation tools (CT) based on human-wildlife interaction and human-wildlife-centred design. This will be followed by five case studies ranging in complexity from cat collars to machine learning and game theory methodologies. Conservation technology not only has the potential to benefit biodiversity but also has broader impacts on fields such as sustainability and environmental protection. By using innovative technologies to address conservation challenges, we can find more effective and efficient solutions to protect and preserve our planet’s resources.","",https://doi.org/10.52843/cassyni.v6j444,"",,

It has emerged as a powerful tool to analyze clinical samples for human biology research, therapeutic discovery, and translational medicine. As one of the fastest growing areas in the biotech industry, spatial omics is poised to drive the next biology revolution with broad impact across life science and medicine.In this debut special issue of GEN Biotechnology, we are delighted to feature a collection of spatial omics perspectives, reviews, and original research articles capturing the breadth of the field from cancer research to the newest advances in imaging methods.Lift OffThe historical roots of visualizing biological function date back 300 years with the invention of the compound microscope by Robert Hooke. Individual cells were seen for the first time in a plant leaf, and researchers could already visualize highly heterogeneous cell morphology implicated in distinct functions in various tissue regions. While the modern era of molecular and cell biology associates morphological heterogeneity with differential gene expression, it was the rise of single-cell genomewide gene expression measured by next-generation sequencing (NGS) platforms that allowed for detailed quantification of cellular heterogeneity in gene expression. Further breakthroughs in massively parallel single-cell sequencing via cellular barcoding enabled the gene expression profiling of thousands of single cells, thereby dissecting cell types and states in large cell populations. But despite these major breakthroughs in single-cell omics, analyzing cellular heterogeneity in the tissue context remained a challenge.Over the past decade, we have witnessed the exponential growth of an emerging field—spatial omics. The goal is to map genomewide biomolecular information pixel-by-pixel in undissociated tissue to yield a holistic view of cell type, state, and function in the native tissue context. Broadly speaking, there are two avenues to achieve this goal—one based on imaging, and the other based on NGS.Imaging-based spatial omicsAlthough single-molecule imaging and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) are established techniques, it was not intuitive how to expand them to image genomewide expression. It was the conceptional breakthrough to combine FISH probes, as demonstrated in multiplexed error-robust fluorescence in situ hybridization (MERFISH) and sequential FISH, with repeated hybridization and imaging that eventually led to genomewide spatial gene expression profiling by single-molecule FISH.Spatial phenotyping at single-cell resolution has become valuable to analyze tumors and the tumor microenvironment (TME). While most high-plex spatial studies have focused on transcriptomic analysis (see the review article on page 384), researchers from Akoya Biosciences present a framework for single-cell spatial analysis of proteins to analyze head and neck squamous cell carcinomas, the seventh most common cancer (see on page 419). The authors state that this spatial mapping of the proteome in homeostasis and disease provides applications to identify novel biomarkers, disease stratification, and understand the basis of variable clinical responses. (For more news coverage on the latest advances in spatial omics and the TME, see the news feature by Sachin Rawat on page 342.)NGS-based spatial omicsA landmark paper published by Joakim Lundeberg and colleagues in 2016 in Science1 demonstrated the use of DNA microarrays (spot size 100 μm) to capture mRNA molecules released from a tissue section that was placed on the slide and permeabilized to allow mRNA molecules to escape. Then, reverse transcription on the slide generates spatially barcoded cDNA that can be pooled, amplified, and profiled using paired-end NGS to read spatially resolved unbiased genomewide gene expression spot-by-spot in a tissue section. This technology was commercialized by 10 × Genomics in 2019 as the Visium Spatial platform, resulting in rapid and wide-spread adoption in a variety of biological and biomedical fields.The cover of this issue, crafted by talented artist Mon Oo Yee, features one of the most-studied human organs, the brain, and illustrates how spatial omics provides a powerful tool to understand neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). On page 399, researchers from Johns Hopkins University present a roadmap for identifying spatially resolved transcriptional signatures associated with amyloid-beta pathology in postmortem brain tissue from AD patients. The authors state that their data analysis workflow, using the 10 × Visium Spatial Proteogenomics platform, represents a proof-of-principle for the power of multiomic profiling in spatial characterization of molecular dynamics associated with brain pathology.New DimensionsOver the past 3 years, the general foundational approach of barcoded solid-phase RNA capture for spatial transcriptomics profiling has been further improved to demonstrate subcellular spatial gene expression mapping (e.g., SeqScope, Stereo-seq, and Pixel-seq). Nevertheless, they all follow the same fundamental principles coined by Lundeberg as “barcoded solid surface for mRNA capture and spatial transcriptomics.” Since 2019, there has been a technically distinct, contrasting approach to spatial omics, one based on spatially defined delivery of DNA barcodes into a fixed and permeabilized tissue to perform deterministic barcoding in tissue for spatial omics sequencing (DBiT-seq). This approach turns out to be highly versatile, which not only demonstrated for the first time spatial multi-omics sequencing (transcriptome and proteins) but also has been further developed to enable spatially resolved epigenome sequencing (i.e., spatial-ATAC-seq and spatial-CUT&Tag) as well as spatial epigenome-transcriptome co-sequencing. This has opened an entirely new dimension in the field of spatial biology.Given the important role of gene expression profile to determine a cell type or state, spatial transcriptomics is largely synonymous with spatial gene expression mapping. But what is emerging beyond spatial gene expression represents the most exciting frontiers in this field. As noted above, DBiT is unique in its versatility, unlocking a whole new direction in spatial epigenomics. Recently, image-based methods such as MERFISH have also demonstrated targeted detection of epigenetic loci associated with specific histone markers.Spatial metabolomics is another branch that is poised to provide indispensable information regarding cellular function in relation to diet, aging, and disease. Mass spectrometry imaging allows for near single cell resolution profiling of metabolites such as lipidome in an unbiased manner to differentiate different lipid species. Optical chemical imaging including infrared and stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) imaging is unique in that it can detect select metabolites at an unprecedented subcellular or even nanometer-scale resolution, and it is nondestructive and label free.On page 435, researchers from Duke University present a label-free reflection-mode hyperspectral photoacoustic microscopy (RHS-PAM) system to overcome the limitations of conventional hyperspectral imaging methods, which predominantly rely on fluorescent signatures, limiting their application to nonfluorescent samples. The report illustrates the ability of RHS-PAM to utilize the optical absorption contrast of nucleic acids, proteins, hemoglobin, melanin, and lipids in an array of model organisms, including Caenorhabditis elegans, zebrafish, and mice. RHS-PAM may offer clinicians a more noninvasive method to obtain cellular-level spatial omics, thereby opening new doors to diagnostics and treatments.Back to spatial mapping of RNA molecules, the life of an RNA molecule is rich and dynamic, far beyond the capacity of spatial gene expression to reveal. Thus, researchers are still grappling with how to map RNA molecules at different stages of their life cycles, their splicing variants, their interaction with proteins, and the regulation mechanism of noncoding RNAs—these are all important questions in cellular and tissue biology. Finally, we would like to know how to map temporal dynamics of biomolecules and cells and how to map them in large 3D tissue structure at genome scale. These are the next frontiers of spatial omics, which may be on the horizon in the following years.Rounding out this special issue on spatial omics are two important Perspectives. On page 360, researchers from Yale describe key clinical applications of spatial omics technologies, such as retrieval of disease-related information in single samples and the development of personalized treatments. While technical and financial challenges still limit the deployment of these technologies in clinical laboratories, the potential for spatial omics to deepen pathologic analysis in human tissue sampling remains unfathomed. And on page 372, a team from Georgia Institute of Technology and Emory University describe the directions in spatial omics for organoid characterization. Through a case study using retinal organoids and native retinal tissues, the authors discuss how spatial omics can enhance the in situ study of single cells in organoids without expensive animal models.That's not all in this issue of GEN Biotechnology! We also have a fascinating interview with genome-editing pioneer Fyodor Urnov (page 347); a profile of Charles Zuker's new company Kallyope (page 338); a commentary from Sean Ekins on strategies for developing treatments for rare diseases (page 353); and a news feature on the promise of artificial intelligence in the field of protein design (page 333).We hope you enjoy this special issue on spatial omics, and we will continue to encourage submissions of groundbreaking studies showcasing and advancing this powerful technology. And look for the imminent announcement of our next special issue to be published in 2024—BIOTECHNOLOGY AND HEALTH DISPARITIES, assisted by guest editors Brian Aguado (University of California, San Diego), Karmella Haynes (Emory University), and Ana Maria Porras (University of Florida).Rong Fan, PhD (Yale University), served as guest editor for this special issue of GEN Biotechnology.

rayyan-210744816,Prelude: Saving the national animal of India and Nepal,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"The Gangetic Dolphin, also known as the South Asian River Dolphin, Indian Dolphin, or Ganges River Dolphin, is one of only five species of freshwater dolphins found worldwide. This unique species is distinct due to its long, slender snout and being approximately twice the length of other river dolphins.As an important indicator species for the health of river ecosystems, the Gangetic Dolphin is highly sensitive to changes in water quality and habitat degradation. Unfortunately, this species is considered endangered on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species due to various threats, including habitat loss, pollution, and accidental entanglement in fishing gear. Numerous conservation efforts are being implemented to protect this endangered species, including establishing protected areas and conservation programs to reduce pollution and promote responsible fishing practices. Nevertheless, continued conservation efforts are necessary to safeguard the future of the Gangetic Dolphin and its vital role in maintaining the health of river ecosystems.Dolphins are intelligent, social animals that play an important role in aquatic ecosystems where they live. They are top predators and help maintain the food chain's balance in the ecosystem. Additionally, many people enjoy seeing wild dolphins, which promotes tourism. Dolphins are found worldwide and in diverse aquatic environments including oceans, coastal, estuarine and freshwater - and in temperatures ranging from sub-zero to more than 30 °C. There are 36 species of marine dolphins. The most common species of marine dolphins are the Bottlenose Dolphin, the Common Dolphin, and the Orca, also known as the Killer Whale.River dolphins, on the other hand, are much rarer and found only in a few river systems worldwide. Freshwater, or river dolphins, are cetaceans living exclusively in freshwater rivers and lakes. There are several species of freshwater dolphins, each with a distinct distribution range: These include the Amazon River Dolphin: also known as the Pink River Dolphin, found in the Amazon River and its tributaries in South America, including the Orinoco, Araguaia, and Tocantins rivers. The Indus River Dolphin (Platanista minor) is found only in the Indus river system, including the Sutlej, Ravi, and Beas rivers of Pakistan and India. Baiji Dolphin: also known as the Chinese River Dolphin or Yangtze River Dolphin, was once found only in the Yangtze River in China, but unfortunately, is now considered functionally extinct. Franciscana Dolphin, also known as the La Plata, is found in the estuary of the Rio de la Plata in South America, including Brazil, Uruguay, and Argentina, while the Irrawaddy Dolphin inhabits rivers and estuaries of Southeast Asia, including the Mekong River, the Irrawaddy River, and the Mahakam River in Indonesia. Platanista gangetica gangetica is localized in the Ganges, Brahmaputra, Meghna and Sangu–Karnaphuli rivers systems in India, Nepal, and Bangladesh. This species is locally known as ‘susu’ after the noise it makes when it breathes. Ganges River Dolphins, often considered the “Tiger of the Ganges”, is an indicator species with the same role in a river ecosystem as a tiger in a forest. However, it is essentially blind and relies on echolocation, which means the dolphin senses sound waves in the water to navigate, detect prey and communicate. It is estimated that there are approximately 2,500-3,000 Ganges River Dolphins left living in the wild. Furthermore, dolphins play critical ecological roles in the ecosystems they inhabit, such as controlling prey populations and maintaining the health of their habitats.As mentioned earlier, the Gangetic Dolphin is one of the world's most endangered freshwater species, with only a few thousand individuals remaining in their natural range. Their survival faces various significant challenges, including habitat degradation, pollution, illegal, destructive and overfishing, navigation, and climate change.The construction of dams, barrages, roads, water diversion and extraction projects, sand mining, dredging, navigation, and varying anthropogenic activities have caused a significant impact on the natural habitat and its fragmentation, impacting dolphins. The contamination of rivers and other water bodies with chemicals, sewage, plastics, and other pollutants causes severe threats to the health of the dolphins and their prey, leading to a decline in their population.Dolphins face accidental deaths from fishing practices such as trawling, gillnetting, and purse-seining, leading to their entanglement and drowning. They may also get caught and killed as bycatch when fishing for other species. Overfishing also depletes the availability of adequate fish for dolphins, which may result in a decline in their population. Additionally, dolphins face injuries and accidental deaths due to collisions with fishing and other boats, leading to a cascading impact on the ecosystems they inhabit.Climate change-mediated consequences, such as rising temperatures and changing precipitation patterns, etc., affect the flow of rivers and the availability of food and habitat for dolphins, thus impacting their survival. Navigation-mediated noise pollution causes disruptions in the dolphins’ capability to communicate and echolocate, thereby disturbing their ability to locate prey and communicate with one another. Navigation and anchoring disrupt essential dolphin habitats, which may decrease prey availability and ultimately impact the abundance of dolphins in the area.Lack of awareness and ecological education about the importance of Gangetic dolphins and their conservation among local communities, school children, other stakeholders and policymakers hinder conservation efforts. Even the loss of a few individuals can significantly impact dolphin populations, given their low reproductive rates and long lifespans, particularly in areas where their populations are already threatened or declining.The Gangetic dolphin has been declared the national aquatic animal of India and Nepal to increase conservation awareness for the endangered species. Bangladesh and Bhutan have also taken steps to protect the species. Although they have not declared this species their national aquatic animal, both countries promote sustainable tourism and watch dolphin habitats.Conservation efforts and regulatory measures are being taken to protect the Ganges river dolphin. The Indian Government has launched several programs, including the Ganges River Dolphin Conservation Action Plan and the National River Conservation Plan, to conserve the species and its habitat. These plans focus on reducing pollution in the Ganges river, the primary habitat of the dolphin, and increasing public awareness about the need to conserve this species. The Government has also established protected areas for the dolphin and has launched programs to study its behaviour and habitat. Vikramshila Gangetic Dolphin Sanctuary, Bhagirathi Dolphin Sanctuary, and the Sundarbans Biosphere Reserve deserve mention. The Bangladesh government is also implementing the Dolphin Conservation Action Plan, which includes establishing protected areas and promoting ecotourism. Bangladesh has designated protected habitats for the Gangetic dolphin, including the Sundarbans, and established nine sanctuaries to protect riverine cetaceans, with a management plan for the three dolphin sanctuaries of the Sundarbans. The 20 km segment from the Halda River mouth to Sattar Ghat has been identified as a dolphin hotspot. Activities harmful to dolphins and their habitats are strictly monitored and prevented in these areas. The Nepalese Government has established protected areas like Bardia National Park and the Karnali River Dolphin Conservation Reserve. Non-government and Government-led conservation organizations are collaborating to raise public awareness and implement community-based conservation programs about the importance of conserving dolphins and implementing sustainable fishing practices. Research is ongoing to better understand the species distribution, population size, and potential threats. Bhutan, where the Gangetic dolphin is not a resident or endemic species, is equally committed to conserving aquatic biodiversity and has taken steps to protect its riverine habitats and species. In Bhutan, the Government and organizations like the Royal Society for Protection of Nature are committed to conserving aquatic biodiversity and have conducted surveys to assess the population and distribution of river dolphins. While no dolphins were sighted in the Mangdechhu river, further studies are recommended to understand the species’ status in Bhutan.Conservation efforts are directed towards reducing dolphin bycatch, including implementing fishing gear and fishing practices regulations, educating fishermen on responsible fishing practices, and establishing protected areas. Responsible navigation practices minimize disturbance and avoid sensitive habitats to promote dolphin health and abundance. Reductions in boat traffic may increase the availability of food and ease of catching prey for dolphins. Other factors, such as changes in environmental conditions, may also impact dolphins and require further research.Several regulations have been implemented in the region to conserve these rare creatures. These include: The Wildlife Protection Act of India (1972, see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_Life_(Protection)_Act,_1972) protects the Gangetic dolphin under Schedule I and prohibits hunting, poaching, capturing, or killing any wild animal, including dolphins.The National River Conservation Plan, launched by the Indian Government to conserve and manage rivers and their ecosystems, with a focus on the conservation of the Gangetic dolphin and its habitat.International agreements such as the Convention on Biological Diversity and the Convention on Migratory Species, signed by South Asian countries to protect the Gangetic dolphin and other endangered species in the region. These agreements provide a framework for cooperation between countries in conserving these species and their habitats.The Gangetic river dolphin is endangered in Bangladesh and protected under the Wildlife (Conservation and Security) Act of 2012.In Bhutan, the species is considered sacred and protected under the Forest and Nature Conservation Act.In Nepal, gill nets, a significant threat to the Gangetic dolphin, have been banned in areas where the species is found.Conserving the Gangetic Dolphin is challenging and requires collaboration between governments, conservation organizations, and local communities. Implementing these regulations and working together can ensure the survival of these amazing creatures for future generations.River Dolphins are considered indicators of ecosystem health in river basins. Recent reports in newspapers and social media, although qualitative and descriptive in nature, have highlighted the awareness about probable impacts of the COVID-19 lockdown on the changing riverine ecosystem health and the population of dolphins. The pandemic has significantly impacted human health and socio-economic conditions worldwide; the virus quickly spread across the globe, leading to millions of infections and deaths and overwhelming healthcare systems. Social distancing measures, such as lockdowns and quarantines, have been implemented to slow the spread of the virus but have had significant socio-economic impacts, such as widespread job losses, business closures, and reduced economic activity. This reduction in economic activity appears to have led to impacts on the aquatic environment and biodiversity. Reducing human activities, such as travel and transportation, navigation and fishing, has reduced pollution. It is reported in India that the water quality of the Ganges river has improved due to a reduction in the anthropogenic activities.Sincere efforts are underway in India and neighbouring countries of South Asia to protect the endangered Gangetic river dolphin. These efforts include implementing water quality standards, conserving and restoring river habitats, and reducing fishing and human-induced disturbances. Several protected areas have been established in India and other neighbouring countries. Habitat conservation is a key component of India's “Namami Ganga Programme”. Local communities are being targeted through conservation education programs to raise awareness and mobilize their active participation in complying with existing acts and regulations to prohibit activities that negatively impact dolphins. Certain international and regional agreements have been signed to support conservation efforts. Research is also being conducted to better understand the species’ ecology and behaviour. Such forward-looking and proactive conservation measures aim to prevent the extinction of the Gangetic River Dolphin and increase its population. However, more must be done to ensure the long-term health of the river systems and the species that dwell in them. This needs implementation of an organized collection of quantitative experimental scientific data to document the response of dolphins to changing physical, chemical and biological conditions of the ecosystem.In order to enhance our knowledge and research about the ecology of dolphins a webinar was convened from August 24–25, 2020 sponsored by IFSI, ICAR-CIFRI, NMCG, PFGF, India and AEHMS, Canada: Exploring the impact of COVID-19 on the ecosystem health of rivers and its dolphin population: Present status and future strategy for conservation in India-Bangladesh-Myanmar-Nepal. The event led to the publication of this special issue of Aquatic Ecosystem Health and Management due to the persistent efforts of the AEHMS.Now there is a need to consider holding a follow-up workshop with the suggested theme of “Uniting for the Survival of the South Asian River Dolphin: Conservation Strategies for an Endangered Species.” Such a workshop would provide a platform to report scientific research, deliberate and discuss the progress made post-webinar period, and conceptualize a collaborative regional initiative appropriate for the critical nature of the South Asian River Dolphin's survival. Such a workshop would also invite innovative conservation strategies for freshwater river dolphins with enhanced use of emerging technology, including tagging to track their movements and habitat use via satellites, acoustic monitoring to estimate population size, community-based conservation involving fishing reduction and educational outreach programs, AI (artificial intelligence) to analyze satellite imagery data for habitat identification, and DNA analysis for population structure and genetic diversity. These innovations would enhance our understanding of the ecology of river dolphins towards planning more effective conservation projects in the future.Thanks are due to Dr. B.K. Das of CIFRI and various sponsors for initiating the webinar and Dr. M. Munawar, AEHMS for organizing this special issue. The reviews and revisions by Drs. Martin Van der Knaap and Mohiuddin Munawar, and meticulous editing by Jennifer Lorimer and Susan Blunt of AEHMS improved the original version of this prelude and is greatly appreciated.","",https://doi.org/10.14321/aehm.026.01.03,"",,
rayyan-210744936,Deep Learning Techniques for Enhanced Underwater Remote Sensing: Applications in Marine Biodiversity and Infrastructure Inspection,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Underwater remote sensing has become an essential tool for marine biodiversity studies and underwater infrastructure inspection. However, the unique challenges posed by underwater environments, such as light absorption, scattering, and low visibility, necessitate advanced image processing techniques.

rayyan-210744959,A deep learning macroecological model to assess the combined effect of habitat loss and climate change on biodiversity,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Climate change and habitat loss are major drivers of biodiversity loss, yet their combined effects at local and global scales remain insufficiently understood. To improve our understanding of the response of biodiversity to these intertwined drivers, we introduce a deep learning, spatially explicit macroecological model. Our model builds upon fundamental ecological generalizations, namely species-area relationships (SAR) and environmental niches, to predict local species richness based on habitat type, habitat surface area, and local climate and environmental predictors. Focusing on European plant species, we compile a comprehensive dataset consisting of habitat polygons, along with associated bioclimatic and environmental conditions. This dataset, complemented with opportunistic species occurrence data used to derive local species richness, is employed to train our deep-learning model. The model's accuracy is validated against an independent, plot-based dataset. This validation step not only demonstrates the model's capacity to accurately predict species richness across diverse habitat types and environmental conditions but also facilitates uncertainty estimation. We use explainable AI techniques to dissect the processes guiding the model's predictions, advancing our understanding of the complex relationships between climate, habitat, and biodiversity, and identifying vegetation group-specific drivers of species richness. We further discuss the model's potential for conducting comprehensive biodiversity change attribution studies. Looking ahead, we outline how the approach could be extended to predict functional groups. This is a crucial step towards coupling climate and biodiversity models to capture not only the effects of climate on biodiversity but also the feedbacks provoked by biodiversity on Earth system processes.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu24-15869,"",,
rayyan-210745066,Biodiversity Assessment in Drylands Using Augmented Satellite Imagery Through Deep Learning Models,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"As global biodiversity faces increasing threats from climate change, habitat loss, and human activities, effective methods for assessing and monitoring biodiversity are crucial. Drylands are particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, and integrating remote sensing technology with ecological research can help protect these environments. Identification of individual trees and shrubs is fundamental to assess biodiversity and can also improve carbon stocks estimates. However, identifying individual trees using medium resolution satellite images is often not feasible. The use of advanced technologies, such as machine learning and satellite imagery in environmental management plays a key role in biodiversity conservation and can potentially fill this gap. The use of readily available Maxar satellite imagery makes conservation approaches accessible and cost-effective, which is crucial for widespread adoption, especially in resource-limited settings or for large-scale studies. This study aims to improve the identification of vegetation in dryland ecosystems by integrating deep learning methods to remote sensing. The primary objective was to distinguish vegetation from rocks or shadows in these areas, which is often challenging due to the dark appearance of vegetation and the similar visual features of the landscape, such as landforms textures, water bodies or man-made objects.. To address this challenge, a Vision Transformer (ViT) deep learning model was developed to estimate near infrared (NIR) spectral bands from high resolution Maxar Satellite images. By enhancing the spectral richness, the model aids in the differentiation of vegetation. Maxar satellite imagery was primarily used because of its accessibility through Google services, making it ideal for planning initial surveys to identify areas of interest for more detailed study. The accuracy of the model was validated against high-resolution SkySat NIR imagery, and achieved an R2 of 0.92. The obtained NIR band helped to clearly distinguish vegetation from non-vegetative surfaces such as soil, rocks, and water, which were not as discernible in RGB imagery alone. The use of a deep learning method to estimate a synthetic NIR band proved to be cost-effective and efficient for large-scale identification of individual trees and shrubs in drylands, overcoming the limitations of medium-resolution satellite imagery. The findings of the study are crucial to the conservation of biodiversity and offer a practical approach for environmentalists and researchers. Future work includes expanding the dataset to include various dryland environments, and integrating additional data sources such as soil data and topographic features for a more comprehensive analysis.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu24-20836,"",,

This review discusses how big data analytics and artificial intelligence (AI) can significantly enhance our understanding of microclimates and animal behaviors under changing climatic conditions. We explore AI’s potential to refine microclimate models and analyze data from advanced sensors and camera technologies, which capture detailed, high-resolution information. This integration can allow researchers to dissect complex ecological and physiological processes with unprecedented precision. We describe how AI can enhance microclimate modeling through improved bias correction and downscaling techniques, providing more accurate estimates of the conditions that animals face under various climate scenarios. Additionally, we explore AI’s capabilities in tracking animal responses to these conditions, particularly through innovative classification models that utilize sensors such as accelerometers and acoustic loggers. For example, the widespread usage of camera traps can benefit from AI-driven image classification models to accurately identify thermoregulatory responses, such as shade usage and panting. AI is therefore instrumental in monitoring how animals interact with their environments, offering vital insights into their adaptive behaviors. Finally, we discuss how these advanced data-driven approaches can inform and enhance conservation strategies. In particular, detailed mapping of microhabitats essential for species survival under adverse conditions can guide the design of climate-resilient conservation and restoration programs that prioritize habitat features crucial for biodiversity resilience.

Passive acoustics is a non-invasive and cost-efficient monitoring tool increasingly employed for monitoring animal communities. However, insect sounds remain highly unexplored, hindering the application of this technique for pollinators. To overcome this shortfall and support future developments, we recorded and characterized wingbeat sounds of a variety of Iberian domestic and wild bees and tested their relationship with taxonomic, morphological, behavioural and environmental traits at inter- and intra-specific levels. Using directional microphones and machine learning, we shed light on the acoustic signature of bee wingbeat sounds and their potential to be used for species identification and monitoring. Our results revealed that frequency of wingbeat sounds is negatively related with body size and environmental temperature (between-species analysis), while it is positively related with experimentally induced stress conditions (within-individual analysis). We also found a characteristic acoustic signature in the European honeybee that supported automated classification of this bee from a pool of wild bees, paving the way for passive acoustic monitoring of pollinators. Overall, these findings confirm that insect sounds during flight activity can provide insights on individual and species traits, and hence suggest novel and promising applications for this endangered animal group.

rayyan-210745836,Drones and machine learning for habitat monitoring,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"The increasing decline in the status of habitats, mainly due to anthropogenic stressors, has spurred the development and implementation of many conservation-related legislation. This legislation involves mapping, a critical task to gather important information about the habitats, including their locations, spatial extents and changes over time. Advancements in mapping technologies, such as drones and machine learning, can be integrated with conventional field surveys to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of mapping habitats. The study assessed the effectiveness of drone-acquired data and machine learning as tools for accurate and detailed mapping of highly dynamic and fine-scale mosaics of habitats in a coastal dune environment. Drone imagery and field data were acquired in a dune site in Kerry, Ireland, during the growing season in 2020: May (early), July (mid) and October (late). Topographic data representing the terrain of the site were also generated during the photogrammetric processing of the images. These datasets were then processed and analysed using the Random Forest machine learning technique to classify dune habitats at this site. The results showed that using multiple drone datasets acquired throughout the vegetation growing season achieved higher classification accuracy compared to using just a single dataset (92.37% vs. 84.09%, respectively). Also, including topographic data consistently improved the accuracy, regardless of the number of datasets. Comparing the three drone-acquired datasets, the analysis suggested that the dataset acquired in the middle period of the growing season, i.e., the flowering period, was better than those acquired in the early or late periods for dune habitat mapping. A critical aspect of habitat conservation is tracking the location and expansion of invasive species, which is considered a major threat to and pressures on habitats. This study also explored the potential of utilising drone imagery and deep learning (DL) techniques for mapping invasive species, including those in the early stages of invasion, i.e., occurring in small patches. However, creating a robust DL model is challenging due to the requirement for large and diverse labelled training data. The study implemented a DL semantic segmentation on drone imagery and investigated the potential of applying data augmentation and pseudo-labelling to increase the amount and diversity of labelled data. Results showed that DL-based segmentation achieved high accuracy (mean Intersection-Over-Union [mIOU] score=0.832). The model trained on the augmented and pseudo-labelled data achieved an mIOU score of 0.712 on an independent dataset, while there was a decrease of 0.158 in model performance when only the original labelled data were used. This result suggests the potential of using data augmentation and pseudo-labelling techniques in creating more robust models. Overall, the combined use of high-resolution drone data and machine learning techniques offers massive potential for repeatable and systematic approaches to fine-scale habitat characterisation.

rayyan-210746134,Innovative Methods in Grassland Monitoring: Integrating UAV Data for Ecosystem Assessment,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Grassland ecosystems play a vital role in biodiversity and carbon sequestration, but assessing these ecosystem services accurately is challenging due to their inherent spatial and temporal variability. Conventional field-based methods are often labor-intensive and may not capture this heterogeneity effectively. Recent progress in assessing grassland ecosystems has utilized a combination of structural and spectral data from Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), showing promise for a thorough understanding of vegetation behavior. However, this method frequently overlooks an important factor &amp;#8212; the horizontal variability within the vegetation, which significantly influences the precision of estimating plant characteristics, particularly in diverse ecosystems. Our study aims to fill this gap by incorporating texture analysis, a critical but often overlooked element in UAV-based assessments. Our research explored the potential of integrating various UAV-derived features to improve the estimation of above-ground biomass (AGB) and species richness in heterogeneous grasslands, key indicators of ecosystem health and productivity. This research investigated the efficacy of combining UAV-derived canopy height, multispectral data, and texture features for AGB and species richness estimation. The study was conducted in a heterogeneous wet grassland ecosystem, using a UAV equipped with multispectral sensors to capture high-resolution imagery. The imagery was processed to extract a range of features, including spectral indices, canopy height models, and textural information using Grey Level Co-occurrence Matrix methods. These features were then used to develop predictive models for AGB and species richness using advanced machine learning techniques, including Random Forest. Model performance was evaluated based on their predictive accuracy and ability to handle the spatial heterogeneity of grassland ecosystems. The study found that models integrating texture analysis with traditional spectral and structural data significantly improved predictive accuracy. For AGB estimation, the best models achieved an R&amp;#178; value of up to 0.84, with a relative root mean square error (rRMSE) of 26.58%. In predicting species richness, the most effective models reached an R&amp;#178; of 0.54 and a relative rRMSE of 31.95%. These results indicate an enhancement in estimation precision compared to models using traditional structural and spectral data types alone. This research demonstrated that UAV-based remote sensing, combined with a fusion of spectral, structural, and textural data, can improve the assessment of grassland characteristics such as AGB and species richness. The findings underscore the potential of integrated UAV-derived datasets in ecological monitoring and highlight the importance of advanced data processing and machine learning techniques in environmental research.

rayyan-210746234,Copy-paste augmentation improves automatic species identification in camera trap images,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"1. Effective conservation requires effective biodiversity monitoring. The pace of global biodiversity change far outstrips the ability of manual fieldwork to monitor it. Therefore, technological solutions, like camera traps, have emerged as a crucial way to meet biodiversity monitoring needs. Camera traps produce vast amounts of data and so AI is increasingly used to label images with species identities. However, AI struggles to identify species from new locations that are not part of the training data (‘generalisation’). Resolving this is crucial for the promise of automated biodiversity monitoring to be realised. 2. Here we use ‘copy-paste’ augmentation to help resolve the generali- sation challenge. Copy-paste augmentation refers to isolating animal ‘segments’ from existing images and pasting the segments onto novel backgrounds, to create new, synthetic images that are then used as part of the training data. Theoretically, this could make a model agnostic to backgrounds and therefore more able to generalise to unseen locations. While generation of synthetic images is commonly used as an augmentation method in other fields, such as medicine, it has not been used before in biodiversity science. 3. We found that copy-paste augmentation improved the ability of AI to identify species in new, unseen locations by 8 ± 2%. There was species-level variation in improvement, but the vast majority of species benefited from the approach. We found mixed results when using copy-paste augmentation on models trained with very small numbers of images (1-8 per species). 4. Copy-paste augmentation improves the ability of AI models to gen- eralise to new, unseen locations. Our method also shows promise for resolving the challenge of long-tailed camera trap data. AIs perform poorly on species in the ‘long tail’ of these distributions because there are very few images to train on. Copy-paste augmentation can help rebalance datasets by adding synthetic images of underrep- resented species. Overall, our results suggest a promising role for augmentation methods that generate new, synthetic images in bio- diversity science. Ecologists and conservationists must move beyond simple augmentation methods, such as image transformations, if we are to resolve key challenges in species identification AI.","",https://doi.org/10.32942/x2vs6k,"",,

It facilitates pest distribution assessment, control measure evaluation, and prediction of pest outbreaks. Additionally, it provides important information on bioindicators with which the state of biodiversity and ecological integrity in specific habitats and ecosystems can be accurately assessed.

Thus, accurate knowledge of the spatial and temporal distribution of animal species is mandatory regarding the preservation of biodiversity and management of offshore wind farms and further economic activities. High-resolution optical imagery of airborne remote sensing sensors enables the observation of marine birds and mammals within large ocean areas. However, the identification of features at the ocean surface as well as the separation of animals and further objects, such as wave structures, ships or buoys, requires time-consuming visual inspection of the acquired image sequences by trained personnel. Here, we apply an AI-based approach to automatically detect and classify various features above the sea surface based on aerial imagery of the German North Sea and Baltic Sea. A large number of optical images at a spatial resolution of 2 cm have been acquired by the German Federal Agency for Nature Conservation (BfN) during repeated monitoring flights since 2018. These images are preprocessed and geolocated by assigning respective auxillary informations to create an extensive database on marine animal observations. The AI method which we are developing has to be responsible both for detecting birds in images, and for tracking instances of a same element present on multiple frames in order to avoid counting an individual multiple times. Some of the main challenges which will have to be dealt with are the following. First, luminosity conditions cannot be controled and might be suboptimal in a large fraction of the images, rendering animals completely white or black, or difficult to distinguish from the background. Second, smaller animals might consist only of little pixel blobs, and thus be difficult to distinguish. Third, flying birds might have shadows, which, while bird-shaped, must not be classified as birds. Fourth, in bird flocks overlapping tricks the AI into detecting one bird instead of several ones, which renders tracking significantly more challenging. We aim at tackling the third and fourth issues by incorporating cinematic estimation of the plane&amp;#8216;s and animal&amp;#8216;s movements, and estimating the direction of the sun in each frame, into the tracking system. In the future, our system will be used by the German Federal Agency for Nature Conservation (BfN) to monitor bird and mammal populations, and evaluate the effectiveness of preservation measures.&amp;#160;","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu24-19604,"",,
rayyan-210746675,Mapping forest biodiversity from optical imagery: a plant trait-based method,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Earth observation is a key component for the establishment of biodiversity monitoring systems. The increasing number of instruments acquiring information on Earth surface provides opportunities to assess and monitor various properties of vegetated ecosystems, including vegetation biochemical and biophysical traits and associated processes such as photosynthesis, growth and adaptation to environmental stress. Multiple approaches have been developed during the past decades to link forest taxonomic diversity with remotely sensed information, with varying degrees of success. Statistical metrics directly derived from the vegetation reflectance such as spectral variance have shown limitations for the estimation of taxonomic diversity. One reason is that factors intrinsic and extrinsic to vegetation influence reflectance and contribute to this variance. On the other hand, this reflectance can be converted into optically effective plant properties (optical traits) using statistical methods (e.g. spectral transformation, machine learning or spectral indices) or physical methods (e.g. physical model inversion) applied to optical imagery, with an objective to reduce the influence of extrinsic factors. The spatial heterogeneity of a set of optical traits may then be used as a relevant proxy for vegetation diversity. Statistical methods are computationally efficient, but lack generalization ability, while physical approaches show better potential for generalization ability, but show limitations when applied on complex systems. Moreover, the set of optical traits accessible from optical data varies with sensor characteristics: new imaging spectroscopy missions expand the range of variables for which quantitative assessment is possible compared to multispectral imagery. We introduce a framework taking advantage of physical modelling to assess a set of vegetation traits then used to feed remotely sensed diversity mapping techniques in the context of forest ecosystems. This approach intends to convert the optical information on a physical basis, in terms of vegetation traits related to structural, compositional and functional properties prior to computing diversity metrics. Physical modeling contributes to minimizing the influence of factors extrinsic to vegetation on optical traits, as a way to improve the generalization ability of existing frameworks taking advantage of Earth observation through space and time. To illustrate it, we used the model PROSAIL to assess Leaf Area Index, leaf chlorophyll content, equivalent water thickness and leaf mass per area from imaging spectroscopy acquired over forested areas. The method implemented in the R package biodivMapR was then applied to compute various diversity metrics from these vegetation biophysical properties, including &amp;#945;- and &amp;#946;-diversity metrics usually obtained from species inventories in ecological applications. We illustrate this framework with data acquired over different sites and with various optical sensors, including airborne and spaceborne imaging spectroscopy, and discuss current limitations.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu24-13456,"",,

RGB high-resolution aerial images have emerged as an efficient source of data for use in the detection and mapping of individual trees in urban areas. In recent years, there has been impressive progress in the field of deep learning methods for use in object detection. Semi-supervised learning is an effective way to deal with the problem that deep learning requires a large amount of labeled data. In this paper, we proposed an improved faster region-based convolutional neural network (Faster R-CNN) with Swin transformer method. Based on existing datasets, the model was trained and then transferred to new datasets. The method was evaluated within three distinct urban areas: a green space, a residential area and a suburban area. The experimental results indicate that our method achieved higher performance than other Faster R-CNN models. This method provides a reference in automated individual tree detection based on high-resolution images in urban areas for urban forestry managers.","",https://doi.org/10.1109/access.2022.3171585,"",,
rayyan-210747117,Application of UAV remote sensing and machine learning to model and map land use in urban gardens,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract Urban gardens are an integral part of urban agricultural systems, contributing to ecosystem services, biodiversity and human wellbeing. These systems occur at fine scales, can be highly complex and therefore offer the opportunity to test mechanisms of ecological patterns and processes. The capacity to confidently characterize urban gardens and their land uses is still lacking, while it could provide the basis for assessing ecosystem service provision. Land classifications from remote sensing platforms are common at the landscape scale, but imagery often lacks the resolution required to map differences in land use of fine-scale systems such as urban gardens. Here, we present a workflow to model and map land use in urban gardens using imagery from an unoccupied aerial vehicle (UAV) and machine learning. Due to high resolutions (&amp;lt;5 cm) from image acquisition at low altitudes, UAV remote sensing is better suited to characterize urban land use. We mapped six common land uses in 10 urban community gardens, exhibiting distinct spatial arrangements. Our models had good predictive performance, reaching 80% overall prediction accuracy in independent validation and up to 95% when assessing model performance per cover class. Extracting spatial metrics from these land use classifications, we found that at the garden and plot scale, plant species richness can be estimated by the total area and patchiness of crops. Land use classifications like these can offer an accessible tool to assess complex urban habitats and justify the importance of urban agriculture as a service-providing system, contributing to the sustainability and livability of cities.","",https://doi.org/10.1093/jue/juac008,"",,
rayyan-210748041,Deep learning and computer vision will transform entomology,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"ABSTRACT Most animal species on Earth are insects, and recent reports suggest that their abundance is in drastic decline. Although these reports come from a wide range of insect taxa and regions, the evidence to assess the extent of the phenomenon is still sparse. Insect populations are challenging to study and most monitoring methods are labour intensive and inefficient. Advances in computer vision and deep learning provide potential new solutions to this global challenge. Cameras and other sensors that can effectively, continuously, and non-invasively perform entomological observations throughout diurnal and seasonal cycles. The physical appearance of specimens can also be captured by automated imaging in the lab. When trained on these data, deep learning models can provide estimates of insect abundance, biomass, and diversity. Further, deep learning models can quantify variation in phenotypic traits, behaviour, and interactions. Here, we connect recent developments in deep learning and computer vision to the urgent demand for more cost-efficient monitoring of insects and other invertebrates. We present examples of sensor-based monitoring of insects. We show how deep learning tools can be applied to the big data outputs to derive ecological information and discuss the challenges that lie ahead for the implementation of such solutions in entomology. We identify four focal areas, which will facilitate this transformation: 1) Validation of image-based taxonomic identification, 2) generation of sufficient training data, 3) development of public, curated reference databases, and 4) solutions to integrate deep learning and molecular tools. Significance statement Insect populations are challenging to study, but computer vision and deep learning provide opportunities for continuous and non-invasive monitoring of biodiversity around the clock and over entire seasons. These tools can also facilitate the processing of samples in a laboratory setting. Automated imaging in particular can provide an effective way of identifying and counting specimens to measure abundance. We present examples of sensors and devices of relevance to entomology and show how deep learning tools can convert the big data streams into ecological information. We discuss the challenges that lie ahead and identify four focal areas to make deep learning and computer vision game changers for entomology.","",https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.03.187252,"",,

rayyan-210748435,Detecting European Aspen (Populus tremula L.) in Boreal Forests Using Airborne Hyperspectral and Airborne Laser Scanning Data,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Sustainable forest management increasingly highlights the maintenance of biological diversity and requires up-to-date information on the occurrence and distribution of key ecological features in forest environments. European aspen (Populus tremula L.) is one key feature in boreal forests contributing significantly to the biological diversity of boreal forest landscapes. However, due to their sparse and scattered occurrence in northern Europe, the explicit spatial data on aspen remain scarce and incomprehensive, which hampers biodiversity management and conservation efforts. Our objective was to study tree-level discrimination of aspen from other common species in northern boreal forests using airborne high-resolution hyperspectral and airborne laser scanning (ALS) data. The study contained multiple spatial analyses: First, we assessed the role of different spectral wavelengths (455–2500 nm), principal component analysis, and vegetation indices (VI) in tree species classification using two machine learning classifiers—support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF). Second, we tested the effect of feature selection for best classification accuracy achievable and third, we identified the most important spectral features to discriminate aspen from the other common tree species. SVM outperformed the RF model, resulting in the highest overall accuracy (OA) of 84% and Kappa value (0.74). The used feature set affected SVM performance little, but for RF, principal component analysis was the best. The most important common VI for deciduous trees contained Conifer Index (CI), Cellulose Absorption Index (CAI), Plant Stress Index 3 (PSI3), and Vogelmann Index 1 (VOG1), whereas Green Ratio (GR), Red Edge Inflection Point (REIP), and Red Well Position (RWP) were specific for aspen. Normalized Difference Red Edge Index (NDRE) and Modified Normalized Difference Index (MND705) were important for coniferous trees. The most important wavelengths for discriminating aspen from other species included reflectance bands of red edge range (724–727 nm) and shortwave infrared (1520–1564 nm and 1684–1706 nm). The highest classification accuracy of 92% (F1-score) for aspen was achieved using the SVM model with mean reflectance values combined with VI, which provides a possibility to produce a spatially explicit map of aspen occurrence that can contribute to biodiversity management and conservation efforts in boreal forests.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/rs12162610,"",,

Reconciling the relative importance of these processes is hindered by current theory, which tends to focus on a single spatial, temporal or taxonomic scale. We introduce a mechanistic model of community assembly, rooted in classic island biogeography theory, which makes temporally explicit joint predictions across three biodiversity data axes: i) species richness and abundances; ii) population genetic diversities; and iii) trait variation in a phylogenetic context. We demonstrate that each data axis captures information at different timescales, and that integrating these axes enables discriminating among previously unidentifiable community assembly models. We combine our massive eco-evolutionary synthesis simulations (MESS) with supervised machine learning to fit the parameters of the model to real data and infer processes underlying how biodiversity accumulates, using communities of tropical trees, arthropods, and gastropods as case studies that span a range of spatial scales.","",https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.01.30.927236,"",,
rayyan-210748525,Advancing terrestrial biodiversity monitoring with satellite remote sensing in the context of the Kunming-Montreal global biodiversity framework,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract Satellite remote sensing (SRS) provides huge potential for tracking progress towards conservation targets and goals, but SRS products need to be tailored towards the requirements of ecological users and policymakers. In this viewpoint article, we propose to advance SRS products with a terrestrial biodiversity focus for tracking the goals and targets of the Kunming-Montreal global biodiversity framework (GBF). Of 371 GBF biodiversity indicators, we identified 58 unique indicators for tracking the state of terrestrial biodiversity, spanning 2 goals and 8 targets. Thirty-six shared enough information to analyse their underlying workflows and spatial information products. We used the concept of Essential Biodiversity Variables (EBV) to connect spatial information products to different dimensions of biodiversity (e.g. species populations, species traits, and ecosystem structure), and then counted EBV usage across GBF goals and targets. Combined with published scores on feasibility, accuracy, and immaturity of SRS products, we identified a priority list of terrestrial SRS products representing opportunities for scientific development in the next decade. From this list, we suggest two key directions for advancing SRS products and workflows in the GBF context using current instruments and technologies. First, existing terrestrial ecosystem distributions and live cover fraction SRS products (of above-ground biomass, ecosystem fragmentation, ecosystem structural variance, fraction of vegetation cover, plant area index profile, and land cover) need to be refined using a co-design approach to achieve harmonized ecosystem taxonomies, reference states and improved thematic detail. Second, new SRS products related to plant physiology and primary productivity (e.g. leaf area index, chlorophyll content &amp; flux, foliar N/P/K content, and carbon cycle) need to be developed to better estimate plant functional traits, especially with deep learning techniques, radiative transfer models and multi-sensor frameworks. Advancements along these two routes could greatly improve the tracking of GBF target 2 (‘improve connectivity of priority terrestrial ecosystems), target 3 (‘ensure management of protected areas’), target 6 (‘control the introduction and impact of invasive alien species’), target 8 (‘minimize impact of climate change on biodiversity’), target 10 (‘increase sustainable productivity of agricultural and forested ecosystems’) and target 12 (‘increase public urban green/blue spaces’). Such improvements can have secondary benefits for other EBVs, e.g. as predictor variables for modelling species distributions and population abundances (i.e. data that are required in several GBF indicators). We hope that our viewpoint stimulates the advancement of biodiversity monitoring from space and a stronger collaboration among ecologists, SRS scientists and policy experts.","",https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.04.25.489356,"",,
rayyan-210748548,Overview of LifeCLEF Plant Identification task 2020,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Automated identification of plants has improved considerably thanks to the recent progress in deep learning and the availability of training data with more and more photos in the field. However, this profusion of data only concerns a few tens of thousands of species, mostly located in North America and Western Europe, much less in the richest regions in terms of biodiversity such as tropical countries. On the other hand, for several centuries, botanists have collected, catalogued and systematically stored plant specimens in herbaria, particularly in tropical regions, and the recent efforts by the biodiversity informatics community made it possible to put millions of digitized sheets online. The LifeCLEF 2020 Plant Identification challenge (or PlantCLEF 2020) was designed to evaluate to what extent automated identification on the flora of data deficient regions can be improved by the use of herbarium collections. It is based on a dataset of about 1,000 species mainly focused on the South America's Guiana Shield, an area known to have one of the greatest diversity of plants in the world. The challenge was evaluated as a cross-domain classification task where the training set consist of several hundred thousand herbarium sheets and few thousand of photos to enable learning a mapping between the two domains. The test set was exclusively composed of photos in the field. This paper presents the resources and assessments of the conducted evaluation, summarizes the approaches and systems employed by the participating research groups, and provides an analysis of the main outcomes.","",,"",,

The identification of plant species is indeed an important step for many scientific, educational and land management activities (for natural or cultivated spaces). This step, which is integrated into various biology training courses, is difficult to develop on a large scale, even for professionals. This difficulty in naming plants by a very large part of the society limits the positive interactions between humans and their environment, and thus reduces awareness of the contribution of plants to the well-being of humanity. It is therefore essential to attempt to solve this problem on a large geographical, taxonomic and sociological scale in order to develop more responsible and environmentally precautionary societies.

rayyan-210748793,Understanding Intraspecific Trait Variability Using Digital Herbarium Specimen Images,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Plant traits are vital to quantify, understand and predict plant and vegetation ecology, including responses to environmental and climate change. Leaf traits are among the best sampled, with more than 200,000 records for individual traits. Nevertheless, their coverage is still strongly limited, especially with respect to characterizing variation within species and across longer time scales. However, to date, more than 3000 herbaria worldwide have collected 390 million plant specimens, dating from the 16th century. At present, the herbarium specimens are rapidly digitized and the images are made openly available to facilitate research and biodiversity conservation. In this study, we determined the potential of the digitized herbarium specimens images to: overcome limitations of data availability for quantitative leaf traits such as the area, length, width along with petiole length and use the trait values to understand the intraspecific variability across spatio-temporal scales. overcome limitations of data availability for quantitative leaf traits such as the area, length, width along with petiole length and use the trait values to understand the intraspecific variability across spatio-temporal scales. For the study, initially, specimen metadata was analysed from various online resources such as the Global Plants Database, Natural History Museum Paris, iDigBio and Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF). Based on the completeness of the metadata, image availability, and the ease of measuring the leaf traits, we selected Salix bebbiana, Alnus incana, Viola canina, Salix glauca, Impatiens capensis, Chenopodium album , and Solanum dulcamara for the study. The semi-automated tool TraitEx (Gaikwad et al. 2019) was used to measure quantitative leaf traits such as the leaf area, perimeter, width, length and petiole length. Finally, excluding duplicates, we downloaded 17383 digital herbarium specimen images from iDigBio and GBIF, which included specimens from the 17th century to the present. However, about 5000 had insufficient information or quality issues, including not-yet-identified duplicates, or no intact leaves. For each selected image we measured four leaf traits - area, length, width and perimeter of the leaf blade - on up to 5 leaves. In sum, we collected about 120,000 trait records from 32009 leaves. Comparison of measured leaf traits to data from the TRY Plant Trait database (Kattge et al. 2019) revealed that we could improve the database for studying intraspecific trait variability by several orders of magnitude (from less than 10-100 records per species to &amp;gt;1000). The variation of trait records within the seven species shows reasonable patterns, which improves trust in the data quality. The extracted trait measurements were used to analyse the intraspecific variability for the species across different spatio-temporal resolutions. Machine learning method (random forest) was used to perform the analysis and the results revealed the imprint of spatial and temporal climate variation, including long term trends and climate change as well as seasonality effects, on leaf area. Through this study, we demonstrate the high benefits of digitizing herbarium specimens and reusing it for research studies to improve ecological knowledge and predictability of size-related leaf traits.","",https://doi.org/10.3897/biss.4.59061,"",,
rayyan-210749091,<scp>eFLORA PROJECT IN THE</scp> D.P.R. <scp>KOREA</scp>: <scp>CURRENT SITUATION AND PROSPECT</scp>,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"The Korean Peninsula, located in Northeast Asia, takes an important place in the global distribution of biodiversity, characterized by a wide variety of habitats, various eco-regions and high species richness, and has attracted the attention of experts in plant diversity and distribution since long before. Until 1945, when Korea had been a colony of Japan, its plant diversity was partly studied and published by foreign scholars (Palibin, 1899–1901; Komarov, 1901–1907; Nakai, 1909, 1911; Mori, 1922). It was not until 7 August 1947, when President Kim Il Sung had initiated personally the project to complete a Flora after Korean liberation, and the national investigations and studies on plants by Korean botanists started. So, the first Collection of Korean plant names (To & al., 1955), containing 2689 species, 667 varieties and 14 forms belonging to 167 families and 913 genera of ferns and seed plants, was published in 1955. This brought together all the information about native species gathered throughout the country and references published on plant species of the Korean Peninsula, which has been of great significance in fixing Korean names of species with scientific names and distribution of each species. After that, the 3-volume Korean pictorial book of flora was published in three consecutive years from 1956, which was the first illustrated work with brief descriptions and figures of plant species (To & al., 1956–1958). In 1964, the improved Collection of Korean higher-plant classification (Ri, 1964), containing 3009 species, 4 subspecies, 1048 varieties and 86 forms belonging to 235 families and 1050 genera, was published, which was based on over 50,000 herbarium specimens and literature references including the Floras of different countries of the world. Based on these achievements and successive investigations and research of the botanists from Kim Il Sung University, the Botanical Institute of the State Academy of Sciences and the Central Botanical Garden, the first Flora Coreana (7 volumes plus appendix), taking the form of a complete Flora, was published until 1979 (Im & al., 1979). This Flora includes descriptions, parallel keys and 2300 original pictures of 3064 species and 973 infraspecific taxa belonging to 76 orders, 172 families, and 936 genera. Meanwhile, Korean sporophytes (9 volumes), a species list of fungi, algae, bryophytes and pteridophytes, was published up to 1991, in which the latter two groups were recorded in volumes 8 and 9, respectively (Kim & Hwang, 1991; Hwang, 1991). After that, an enlarged Flora Coreana was published (9 volumes and appendix) (Im & al., 2000), in which 10 new species and 60 previously unrecorded species were newly added; more than 800 taxa were revised, and auxiliary units such as subfamilies, tribes and sections for complicated and large taxa (Ranunculaceae, Asteraceae, Poaceae, etc.) were set. Most of the arrangement of the orders and families followed the system of Engler (Engler & Prantl, 1887–1915). The process of preparing and revising the Flora extended over scores of years, provided a foundation to systematically classify the country's plant resources and was effectively used in various fields such as biodiversity conservation, education, etc. What lies ahead is to complete the Korean Flora with the groups of liverworts, mosses and pteridophytes added. In general, hardcopy Floras need a long time for preparation and publication, have a limited circulation and deficiencies in updating and communicating data. For example, in the Flora Coreana (Im & al., 1996), only 7 species in Magnolia L. (Magnoliaceae Juss.) have been recorded; therefore, 8 other species, 4 varieties, 1 form and 18 cultivars in the Korean Peninsula cannot be identified using this Flora. Additionally, some character states in the key sometimes cannot be identified in specimens in particular seasons, and in some cases, the key might be misleading. Moreover, there are cases in the Flora in which the same character or character state is described in different terms, or there are some technical terms that students and amateurs find difficult to understand. In recent years, new techniques including polythetic keys, image discrimination, DNA barcoding, etc. are used for identifying plants with the help of rapid developments in IT, which requires digitization and provision of a database for all information on plants. This resulted in the development of eFloras. eFloras make plant identification and browsing of data easier, and thus provide many people with easy access to information on plant resources. In this respect, creating an eFlora is part of the process of implementing the Catalogue of Life (CoL) and World Flora Online (WFO) projects. So, a general and authorized eFlora is in preparation all over the world, helping in the evaluation of protection of global plant diversity. In this context, scientists from many countries attended the XIX International Botanical Congress (Shenzhen, China) to present their research findings (e.g., Lange, 2017; Singh, 2017; Smissen & al., 2017; West & Knapp, 2017). In the D.P.R. Korea, digitizing the catalogue of all higher plants including sporophytes was finished in 2007 and now forms the foundation for the implementation of the CoL and WFO. With this, it is possible to search all taxa in the taxonomic system, from phylum to infraspecific taxon; searching is possible by Korean name, scientific name, common name, synonym, distribution and usage. The digital species list contains all plant taxa from the Korean Peninsula, including those newly recorded or introduced after publication of the hardcopy Flora (Fig. 1). For the implementation of the CoL project, we have to make our database compatible with the standard system of ""Species 2000"" as source database, enabling data exchange with the CoL. Currently, 66 out of 368 families in our source database differ from the taxonomic system of the CoL. Especially, as there are certain differences in position, rank and delimitation of species or intraspecific taxa, it is necessary to verify these and make the most rational modification. Easy species identification is one of the major functions of an eFlora. We assembled a character comparison table for our taxa using tables of character terminology with all possible characters and character states for identification. So far, tables with over 70 qualitative characters, 20 quantitative ones and about 1030 character states have been compiled. Character terminology tables (see the example in Table 1) are prepared only for qualitative characters, such as life form, shape, color, etc., and provide a reference for the input of character states into the character comparison table, whereas the value of a quantitative character can be recorded without a special reference list. However, characters, whether they are qualitative or quantitative, can be recorded in a ""key-item"" list, which is necessary for effective character management and information service. In case of accepting newly identified characters, it should be recorded in the ""key-item"" list. Species are identified by consecutively selecting the corresponding items in comparison with the collected sample, i.e., by a polythetic key, which is superior to dichotomous ones in hardcopy Floras. In each step of identification, only the remaining characters, character states and taxa will be displayed. This process provides high accuracy in taxon identification, and there is always a final result. Using the eFlora in its current state, it is possible to identify about 310 taxa of ferns, 170 taxa of gymnosperms and 4700 taxa of flowering plants, as well as search and browse all higher plants based on Korean, scientific and synonymic names; 22 distribution areas including different provinces and famous mountains; over 30 kinds of usage; and based on the taxonomic system (http://www.ryongnamsan.edu.kp/univ/ko/research/articles/020bf2c45e7bb322f89a226bd2c5d41b). An eFlora contains all plant species in a given area, including cultivars and introduced species. Additionally, the Flora should practically contribute to the implementation of the CoL project, enhance the social consciousness of management and usage of plant resources and conservation of native species, and satisfy the people's cultural and aesthetic demands. Characters and character states with not only pull-down menu but dynamically linked digital images enable users, especially amateurs, to understand and identify characters exactly and effectively. That is why images of all different character states should be prepared (Brach & Song, 2005; Jacquemart & al., 2016). Future tasks for the completion of the Korean eFlora are introducing artificial intelligence in identification by image processing (making necessary increasing the number of photos and improving their quality; currently, there are more than 11,000 photos and images in our eFlora), DNA barcoding, combining it with a geographical information system and online connection with all printed publications and specimens in herbaria. Additionally, the English version of the Korean eFlora should be uploaded on the internet. We acknowledge support by working group members of Kim Il Sung University and Botanical Institute of State Academy of Sciences who take part in the development of the Korean eFlora, and graduates of the botany course of Life Science Faculty who contributed to its development while they were writing their graduation theses.

Automatic satellite imagery analysis can significantly accelerate the process of tree type classification, which is traditionally carried out by ground-based observation. Although computer vision methods have proven their efficiency in remote sensing tasks, specific challenges arise in forestry applications. In this paper, we aim to improve tree species classification based on a neural network approach. We consider four species commonly found in Russian boreal forests: birch, aspen, pine, and spruce. We use imagery from the Sentinel-2 satellite, which has multiple bands (in the visible and infrared spectra) and a spatial resolution of up to 10 meters. Additionally, the short revisit time and free access policy make Sentinel-2 imagery a valuable data source for the purpose of forest classification. In computer vision terms, we define the problem of tree type classification as one of semantic segmentation, assigning a particular tree type to each pixel of the image. The forest inventory data contain tree type composition, but do not describe their spatial distribution within each individual stand. Therefore, some pixels can be assigned a wrong label if we consider each stand to be homogeneously populated by its dominant species. This calls for the use of a weakly supervised learning approach. To solve this problem, we use a deep convolutional neural network with a tailored loss function. We test the proposed models by creating a dataset of images for Leningrad Oblast of Russia. In our study, we demonstrate how to modify the training strategy, such that it can outperform basic per pixel neural network approaches.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/iecf2020-08035,"",,

Thus, this study constitutes a preliminary research in this field, aiming at classifying tree species in Japanese mixed forests using UAV images and deep learning in two different mixed forest types: a black pine (Pinus thunbergii)-black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia) and a larch (Larix kaempferi)-oak (Quercus mongolica) mixed forest. Our results indicate that it is possible to identify black locust trees with 62.6 % True Positives (TP) and 98.1% True Negatives (TN), while lower precision was reached for larch trees (37.4% TP and 97.7% TN).","",https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2007.08907,"",,
rayyan-210749297,Molecular Approaches for Analyzing Organismal and Environmental Interactions,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Our planet is undergoing rapid change due to the expanding human population and climate change, which leads to extreme weather events and habitat loss. It is more important than ever to develop methods which can monitor the impact we are having on the biodiversity of our planet. To influence policy changes in wildlife and resource management practices we need to provide measurable evidence of how we are affecting animal health and fitness and the ecosystems needed for their survival. We also need to pool our resources and work in interdisciplinary teams to find common threads which can help preserve biodiversity and vital habitats. This dissertation showcases how improved molecular biology assays and data analysis approaches can help monitor the fitness of animal populations within changing ecosystems. Chapter 1 details the development of a universal telomere assay for vertebrates. Recent work has shown the utility of telomere assays in tracking animal health. Telomere lengths can predict extinction events in animal populations, life span, and fitness consequences of anthropogenic activity. Telomere length assays are an improvement over other methods of measuring animal stress, such as cortisol levels, since they are stable during capture and sampling of animals. This dissertation provides a telomere length assay which can be used for any vertebrate. The assay was developed using a quantitative polymerase chain reaction platform which requires low DNA input and is rapid. This dissertation also demonstrates how this assay improves on current telomere assays developed for mice and can be used in a vertebrate not previously assayed for telomere lengths, the American kestrel. This work has the potential to propel research in vertebrate systems forward as it alleviates the need to develop new reference primers for each species of interest. This improved assay has shown promise in studies in mouse cell line studies, American kestrels, golden eagles, five species of passerine birds, osprey, northern goshawks and bighorn sheep. Chapter 2 presents a machine learning analysis, using a topic model approach, to integrate big data from remote sensing, leaf area index surveys, metabolomics and metagenomics to analyze community composition in cross-disciplinary datasets. Topic models were applied to understand community organization across a range of distinct, but connected, biological scales within the sagebrush steppe. The sagebrush steppe is home to several threatened species, including the pygmy rabbit (<italic>Brachylagus idahoensis</italic>) and sage-grouse (<italic>Centrocercus urophasianus</italic>). It covers vast swaths of the western United States and is subject to habitat fragmentation and land use conversion for both farming and rangeland use. It is also threatened by increases in fire events which can dramatically alter the landscape. Restoration efforts have been hampered by a lack of resources and often by inadequate collaboration between stakeholders and scientists. This work brought together scientists from four disciplines: remote sensing, field ecology, metabolomics and metagenomics, to provide a framework for how studies can be designed and analyzed that integrate patterns of biodiversity from multiple scales, from the molecular to the landscape scale. A topic model approach was used which groups features (chemicals, bacterial and plant taxa, and light spectrum) into “communities” which in turn can be analyzed for their presence within individual samples and time points. Within the landscape, I found communities which contain encroaching plant species, such as juniper (<italic>Juniperus</italic> spp.) and cheatgrass (<italic>Bromus tectorum</italic>). Within plants, I found chemicals which are known toxins to herbivores. Within herbivores, I identified differences in bacterial taxonomical communities associated with changes in diet. This work will help to inform restoration efforts and provide a road map for designing interdisciplinary studies.","",https://doi.org/10.18122/td/1705/boisestate,"",,
rayyan-210749305,U-Infuse: Democratization of Customizable AI for Object Detection,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Summary Image data is one of the primary sources of ecological data used in biodiversity conservation and management worldwide. However, classifying and interpreting large numbers of images is time and resource expensive, particularly in the context of camera trapping. Deep learning models have been used to achieve this task but are often not suited to specific applications due to their inability to generalise to new environments and inconsistent performance. Models need to be developed for specific species cohorts and environments, but the technical skills required to achieve this are a key barrier to the accessibility of this technology to ecologists. There is a strong need to democratise access to deep learning technologies by providing an easy to use software application allowing non-technical users to custom train custom object detectors. U-Infuse addresses this issue by putting the power of AI into the hands of ecologists. U-Infuse provides ecologists with the ability to train customised models using publicly available images and/or their own camera trap images, without the constraints of annotating and pre-processing large numbers of images, or specific technical expertise. U-Infuse is a free and open-source software solution that supports both multiclass and single class training and inference, allowing ecologists to access state of the art AI on their own device, customised to their application without sharing IP or sensitive data. U-Infuse provides ecological practitioners with the ability to (i) easily achieve camera trap object detection within a user-friendly GUI, generating a species distribution report, and other useful statistics, (ii) custom train deep learning models using publicly available and custom training data, (iii) achieve supervised auto-annotation of images for further training, with the benefit of editing annotations to ensure quality datasets. Broad adoption of U-Infuse by ecological practitioners will improve camera trap image analysis and processing by allowing significantly more image data to be processed with minimal expenditure of time and resources. Ease of training and reliance on transfer learning means domain-specific models can be trained rapidly, and frequently updated without the need for computer science expertise, or data sharing, protecting intellectual property and privacy.","",https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.02.323329,"",,
rayyan-210749489,Assessing urban forest biodiversity through automatic taxonomic identification of street trees from citizen science applications and remote-sensing imagery,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"The positive impact of urban forests and trees on the well-being of urban residents worldwide is well known. Resistance to pests, diseases, and extreme weather events are among the most critical characteristics of resilient cities, closely related to species richness and, consequently, to the diversity of street trees. However, urban forest inventories are currently scarce worldwide. For this reason, urban trees' biodiversity and capacity to provide these ecosystem services are not developed enough. Three state-of-the-art species identification applications were tested, Plant.id, Pl@ntNet and Seek (iNaturalist) to identify a large number of tree families, genera, and species automatically. Two individual Google Street View images were queried for each tree in the study area, adjusting the Field of View and pitch parameters. The predictive capacity of the three apps was compared, and a biodiversity analysis was performed for different geospatial scales within the study area (i.e., at the whole study area, neighborhood, and street levels, respectively). Notably, our research contributes in an innovative way to the assessment and monitoring of the ecosystem services provided by street trees and sheds light on the great potential of combining remote sensing, citizen science and artificial intelligence for urban forest biodiversity assessments at multiple spatial and temporal scales.","",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jag.2024.103735,"",,
rayyan-210749585,"Predicting amphibian intraspecific diversity with machine learning: Challenges and prospects for integrating traits, geography, and genetic data",,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract The growing availability of genetic datasets, in combination with machine learning frameworks, offer great potential to answer long-standing questions in ecology and evolution. One such question has intrigued population geneticists, biogeographers, and conservation biologists: What determines intraspecific genetic diversity? This question is challenging to answer because many factors may influence genetic variation, including life history traits, historical influences, and geography, and the relative importance of these factors varies across taxonomic and geographic scales. Furthermore, interpreting the influence of numerous, potentially correlated variables is difficult with traditional statistical approaches. To address these challenges, we combined repurposed data with machine learning and investigated predictors of genetic diversity, focusing on Nearctic amphibians as a case study. We aggregated species traits, range characteristics, and &gt;42,000 genetic sequences for 299 species using open-access scripts and various databases. After identifying important predictors of nucleotide diversity with random forest regression, we conducted follow-up analyses to examine the roles of phylogenetic history, geography, and demographic processes on intraspecific diversity. Although life history traits were not important predictors for this dataset, we found significant phylogenetic signal in genetic diversity within amphibians. We also found that salamander species at northern latitudes contain lower genetic diversity. Data repurposing and machine learning provide valuable tools for detecting patterns with relevance for conservation, but concerted efforts are needed to compile meaningful datasets with greater utility for understanding global biodiversity.","",https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.03.073049,"",,
rayyan-210749782,Space technology: A powerful tool for safeguarding world heritage,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"The Convention Concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage (WHC), adopted by United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) on November 16, 1972, aims to ensure the identification, protection, conservation, presentation, and transmission to future generations of the world's cultural and natural heritage. The WHC works toward these goals by emphasizing the Outstanding Universal Value (OUV) of heritage sites and the unique contribution such places can make to conservation and human development agendas.1UNESCO, United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization. Operational Guidelines for the Implementation of the World Heritage Convention. Paris, France: UNESCO, 2021.Google Scholar As of the end of January 2023, the WHC has been signed by 194 state parties, covering 1,157 sites (including 900 cultural, 218 natural, and 39 mixed properties), 55 of which are considered to be in danger. These sites, totaling an area of more than 370 million hectares are designated as World Heritage (WH) sites (https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/). WH sites have played a significant role in the sustainable development of society globally and helped effectively maintain and preserve the cultural diversity and global biodiversity of the Earth.2Luo L. Wang X. Guo H. Contribution of UNESCO designated sites to the achievement of sustainable development goals.Innovation. 2022; 3100227Google Scholar However, WH sites around the world are experiencing significant impacts caused, in large part, by increasing anthropogenic threats (such as the rapid spread of urban sprawl, deforestation, resource overexploitation, air pollution, armed conflict, excessive tourism, and poor management).3Allan J.R. Venter O. Maxwell S. et al.Recent increases in human pressure and forest loss threaten many Natural World Heritage Sites.Biol. Conserv. 2017; 206: 47-55Crossref Scopus (104) Google Scholar There is also a range of overarching, long-term global challenges posed by climate change, extreme and severe weather events and geological hazards.4Vousdoukas M.I. Clarke J. Ranasinghe R. et al.African heritage sites threatened as sea-level rise accelerates.Nat. Clim. Chang. 2022; 12: 256-262Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar These threats, anthropogenic or otherwise, have put an unprecedented amount of pressure on the protection of both cultural and natural properties at the heritage sites. There is no conclusive solution to effectively protect heritage sties in the foreseeable future, and the public is becoming increasingly conscious about the negative impacts some anthropogenic activities have brought to heritage sites, exposing them to various risks for irreversible damage and loss. In light of this predicament, UNESCO, alongside its conservation partners, has been actively calling for the use of non-intrusive space technology (ST) to better evaluate and understand the detrimental factors surrounding WH sites and devise effective plans to mitigate negative impacts on OUV through the accurate identification, documentation, monitoring, and understanding of WH sites and their changes across large spatiotemporal scales. For this commentary, ST refers mainly to remote sensing (RS) based on Earth observation (EO) from space, as well as other geospatial information technologies such as geographic information systems (GIS) and global navigation satellite systems (GNSS). Even though ST was not developed intentionally for WH protection, it provides an advanced set of innovative and flexible tools that integrate scientific research into heritage science, which forms the evidential base to support measures for the protection of WH sites. ST also opens up paths of methodological innovation to facilitate future conservation of cultural and natural properties with new paradigms. On the basis of a half-century review of the applications of ST in the field of WH, we find that ST has effectively reshaped our means for WH conservation in four major domains of application: mapping, monitoring, modeling, and management of WH sites (Figure 1A). ST, as an objective and reliable ""eye"" from above for heritage experts, has enabled detailed mapping of heritages at various scales. This application commonly involves the acquisition and updatable analysis of multimodal datasets, combined with near real-time survey and investigation of WH sites and their contextual environments. ST is also an invaluable tool in identifying and designating potential new WH sites. The widespread integration of ST has played a crucial role in UNESCO's routine monitoring and emergency monitoring of cultural and natural heritages as a countermeasure to the challenges presented by global change. In particular, ST has made major contributions to fine-grained monitoring at very high resolutions in time and space and in assessing change caused by natural and/or anthropogenic processes. The combined application of RS, GIS, and augmented reality has facilitated the production of three-dimensional (3D) modeling of WH sites. In addition, photogrammetry and laser scanning can be used in WH surveys for generating 3D documentation of cultural and natural properties. Heritage information models of some popular WH sites have already been actively used in the fields of architecture study and digital ecology. The ability of ST to contribute to the conservation, planning, and management of WH sites has already been commonly used in the following domains: the definition of authenticity and integrity (AI), the mapping of OUV attributes of cultural and natural assets, the development and maintenance of heritage databases, 3D modeling and digital reconstruction, and informing WH management for sustainable development. The UNESCO WHC refers to its ""strategic objectives"" as the ""5 C's"": credibility, conservation, capacity building, communication, and communities.1UNESCO, United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization. Operational Guidelines for the Implementation of the World Heritage Convention. Paris, France: UNESCO, 2021.Google Scholar Here, we propose five key contributions (""5 D's"") of ST for conservation work involving WH sites (see Figure 1B): data, driver, discovery, digital transformation, and decision support. ST and the 5 D's, together with the WHC, constitute the ""turbine model"" for safeguarding WH that is proposed in this commentary and will assist in achieving the 5 C's over the next 50 years. By providing massive multi-source data, ST plays a crucial role in the WH governance chain. Archived data together with ongoing data acquisition record changes at WH sites and provide evidence for their conservation. The data collected through ST will, in turn, serve as an invaluable store of not only raw observations but also derivative products that can be extracted from imagery.5Levin N. Ali S. Crandall D. et al.World Heritage in danger: big data and remote sensing can help protect sites in conflict zones.Global Environ. Change. 2019; 55: 97-104Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar As a result of this data mechanism, ST will be able to mitigate the problem of lacunae in WH data by offering global coverage and consistency. ST is driving a revolution to become a new paradigm of WH protection. It provides advanced tools, such as RS data processing and GIS spatial analysis powered by machine learning, which can be used for dynamic monitoring and spatiotemporal analysis of changes that are occurring at WH sites. From this enhanced monitoring method, WH specialists and managers are empowered with the tools to monitor change over time and to assess whether conservation efforts to mitigate the impacts of natural and anthropogenic processes are contributing to positive outcomes toward sustainability. ST plays a key role in aiding frontier research across multiple disciplines related to heritage science. Scientific discoveries based on the use of new geospatial technologies and big EO data can be applied to the quantitative assessment of the state of WH protection. They can also be used to support deepened multidimensional interpretations of the OUV of WH sites, to guide the sustainable use of WH, and to improve accessibility so that all stakeholders may obtain unbiased and open information, thus increasing the credibility of WH as a global brand. ST provides a means of digital transformation that can be used for identifying, understanding, visualizing, presenting, and interpreting WH sites and their OUV in the digital space. In the future, ST will promote the transformation of WH protection through studies such as tangible heritage, digitalized heritage, or both. GIS-aided digital transformation will greatly improve the quality and efficiency of global communication and the dissemination of information related to WH sites, promoting public awareness of protection concepts and smoothing the implementation of actions. ST is becoming an invaluable tool to provide decision-making support along the entire chain of WH governance, from mapping to monitoring, modeling, and management. ST-based solutions could offer spatial intelligence to inform strategic decision making for multiple stakeholders, including local communities, WH sectors, institutions, and organizations. It offers an innovative path for capacity building and capacity enhancement in relation to the global governance of WH. These solutions are delivered in numerous ways, including databases, technologies, protocols, visualization platforms, and analytical systems. WH is under the influence of a wide array of anthropogenic and natural processes, giving the heritage bodies and national and international organizations promoting the preservation of WH sites an unprecedented opportunity to use science, technology, and innovation, including ST, to experiment innovative solutions and promote the role of WH in achieving sustainable development. Given that natural and anthropogenic challenges can present similar issues in various regions across the globe, it is evident that sharing knowledge and expertise, as well as developing collective strategies to leverage ST, while tailoring our methods to local circumstances, will be fundamental in developing a global approach for WH that is successful in the long run. The past 50 years of applications have resulted in continuous innovation in the development of ST to become powerful, cutting-edge tools for use in heritage documentation, monitoring, assessment and protection, and sustainable development. Although the progress is promising, we must underscore that relying solely on ST is insufficient; the greatest benefits are achieved by integrating ST with a variety of disciplines, such as management, economics, sustainability, sociology, education, ethics, politics, law, art, and aesthetics. Through closer and sustained engagement with a broader cross-section of society and local communities, ST can contribute to opening new horizons for WH protection over the course of the twenty-first century.

rayyan-210749851,Advancing terrestrial biodiversity monitoring with satellite remote sensing in the context of the Kunming-Montreal global biodiversity framework,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Satellite remote sensing (SRS) provides huge potential for tracking progress towards conservation targets and goals, but SRS products need to be tailored towards the requirements of ecological users and policymakers. In this viewpoint article, we propose to advance SRS products with a terrestrial biodiversity focus for tracking the goals and targets of the Kunming-Montreal global biodiversity framework (GBF). Of 371 GBF biodiversity indicators, we identified 58 unique indicators for tracking the state of terrestrial biodiversity, spanning 2 goals and 8 targets. Thirty-six shared enough information to analyse their underlying workflows and spatial information products. We used the concept of Essential Biodiversity Variables (EBV) to connect spatial information products to different dimensions of biodiversity (e.g. species populations, species traits, and ecosystem structure), and then counted EBV usage across GBF goals and targets. Combined with published scores on feasibility, accuracy, and immaturity of SRS products, we identified a priority list of terrestrial SRS products representing opportunities for scientific development in the next decade. From this list, we suggest two key directions for advancing SRS products and workflows in the GBF context using current instruments and technologies. First, existing terrestrial ecosystem distributions and live cover fraction SRS products (of above-ground biomass, ecosystem fragmentation, ecosystem structural variance, fraction of vegetation cover, plant area index profile, and land cover) need to be refined using a co-design approach to achieve harmonized ecosystem taxonomies, reference states and improved thematic detail. Second, new SRS products related to plant physiology and primary productivity (e.g. leaf area index, chlorophyll content & flux, foliar N/P/K content, and carbon cycle) need to be developed to better estimate plant functional traits, especially with deep learning techniques, radiative transfer models and multi-sensor frameworks. Advancements along these two routes could greatly improve the tracking of GBF target 2 ('improve connectivity of priority terrestrial ecosystems), target 3 ('ensure management of protected areas'), target 6 ('control the introduction and impact of invasive alien species'), target 8 ('minimize impact of climate change on biodiversity'), target 10 ('increase sustainable productivity of agricultural and forested ecosystems') and target 12 ('increase public urban green/blue spaces'). Such improvements can have secondary benefits for other EBVs, e.g. as predictor variables for modelling species distributions and population abundances (i.e. data that are required in several GBF indicators). We hope that our viewpoint stimulates the advancement of biodiversity monitoring from space and a stronger collaboration among ecologists, SRS scientists and policy experts.","",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2023.110773,"",,
rayyan-210750009,The Global Tree Assessment provides a multifaceted view on the future of tree diversity conservation,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Trees are of exceptional ecological importance, playing a major functional role in the world's ecosystems, while also supporting many other plants, animals and fungi. The conservation status of tree species is therefore of key importance to planning management strategies and prioritising actions. Through the Global Tree Assessment, we now have knowledge about the threat status for tree species globally. In this special issue of Plants, People, Planet, 13 articles provide a multi-faceted view of the impact of the Global Tree Assessment, how we might improve and accelerate future assessments, and how the information can be used to address issues facing ecosystem restoration. The publication of the State of the World's Trees (BGCI, 2021) has reinforced the growing recognition of the importance of trees and forests to Earth's environmental sustainability. Trees perform vital functions for human society, from basic carbon sequestration to making cities more livable. Trees create rich, multi-dimensional habitats for animals, fungi, and other plants. Essentially, human societies and economies rely on the health and diversity of our planet's trees (Rivers et al., 2022, this issue). With the publication of the Global Tree Assessment, we are gaining a comprehensive understanding of the threat status of trees, allowing us to prioritize conservation efforts and create more effective strategies. In this special issue of Plants, People, Planet, a compelling representation of the complex, multi-faceted, and rapidly changing issues addressed by the Global Tree Assessment is provided. The 13 articles include investigations from a number of different viewpoints and scales, from national assessments of highly diverse but relatively poorly known floras to a single protected area, from a taxonomic focus on a single important family to carefully selected but completely known groups of species, and even specific practical issues involved in the reintroduction and restoration of an endangered species. The paper by Barstow et al. (2022) focuses on the assessment of more than 90% of tree species that are endemic to Papua New Guinea. The study provides valuable information on the risk of extinction, major threats, and the conservation and research needs of the country's tree flora. The contribution by Chua et al. (2022) sheds light on the current state of knowledge regarding extinction risk to tree species in Malaysia (one of world's top megadiverse countries for tree species). The study highlights the extent and types of extinction risk faced by several keystone tree families, namely, Dipterocarpaceae, and tree genera of Myristicaceae and Sapotaceae, whose timbers remain highly valued. Linsky et al. (2022) compare the assessments and ex-situ data over time and examine the most recent information available for Magnoliaceae species to guide the development of national and international conservation strategies in the present era. Erkens et al. (2022) examine the impact of human-induced global change on the ecosystem of the globally distributed tropical plant group Annonaceae (Soursop family). The study utilizes distributional data and International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List assessments to better understand the effects of human activity on this plant group. On the other hand Verspagen and Erkens (2022) present a method to rapidly evaluate the conservation status of species with limited available data, which will accelerate the inclusion of species from large groups into the IUCN Red List. In their article, Rivers et al. (2022) discuss the scientists' warning to humanity on the extinction of tree species. They highlight how the loss of tree species will lead to the extinction of many other plants and animals, significantly altering the world's ecosystems. The article also emphasizes that tree extinction will have a negative impact on billions of people, resulting in the loss of livelihoods and benefits. The work highlights the urgent need for a series of actions to avert an ecological, cultural, and socio-economic catastrophe caused by the widespread extinction of tree species. Rønsted et al. (2022) conducted an assessment of the conservation status of tree flora in the Limahuli Valley of the Hawaiian Island of Kaua'I, and developed a restoration plan for 11 endangered tree species using the Global Tree Assessment framework. The article also offers suggestions for creating sustainable, long-term restoration initiatives. Hills et al. (2022) assessed the risk of extinction of six under-studied genera that have ethnobotanical uses, enabling the establishment of conservation priorities. Dhyani et al. (2022) endeavoured to reintroduce the Critically Endangered Buchanania barberi, a tree species that is endemic to the south Western Ghats (a UNESCO World Heritage site) in Kerala, India that has just two mature individuals remaining. In their study, Yang et al. (2022) presented a compelling case of how conservation techniques and research were employed to rescue the critically endangered tree species Acer yangbiense, resulting in it becoming one of the most successful conservation stories. The global relationship between tree species richness and the number of threatened species found in each country remains consistent, particularly among countries with high species richness (Figure 1a). Madagascar is an exceptional global outlier, with 1842 threatened species out of a total of 3129, while Brazil, the richest country in terms of plant species richness, falls within the predicted trend. Generally, many countries with 1000 plant species or fewer fall below the global trend. Most countries with higher than average threat levels compared with the global trend are island nations, such as Sri Lanka, Cuba, the Philippines, and Indonesia, except for Mexico, which Samain et al. (2022) discuss in their paper. The relationship between the proportions of endemic species versus threatened species is considerably more scattered, with island nations generally containing higher proportions of endemic species. However, many nations with higher and lower than average levels of threatened species are also evident. These broad global patterns of the relationships between threat and species richness can highlight outliers and interesting test cases to examine more closely to better understand the factors driving these outcomes. The articles in this special issue generally represent assessments and analyses of the better-known tree groups and geographic regions, highlighting the limited knowledge of tree species distribution and threat in many parts of the world. In Papua New Guinea, where 36% of species are threatened, a significant proportion of species are also data deficient (Barstow et al., 2022). In Mexico, the assessment excludes plant groups for which no monograph exists, resulting in the exclusion of a considerable amount of the overall plant diversity (Samain et al., 2022). Moreover, the most diverse floras often have a higher proportion of rare species. This makes it increasingly challenging to assess them when the geographic distribution data drops below fewer than five observations. On the other hand, in countries like the United States, where species richness is relatively low and collection records are dense, there are very few data deficient species (Carrero et al., 2022). Essentially, our knowledge of plant diversity tends to be most limited in areas where it is most important, highlighting a clear global inequity between temperate and tropical countries in terms of overall knowledge. In species rich countries, like Colombia (Lopez-Gallego & Morales-Morales, 2023), effective approaches are needed to provide rigorous methods to rapidly assess the threat status of trees in large diverse countries. These assessment efforts are still hampered by the substantial fraction of poorly known species, or even undiscovered species, in some of the world's most biodiverse countries. These countries require two key steps: (i) up-to-date comprehensive collections and (ii) monographic taxonomic treatments. However, achieving these steps is difficult and time-consuming. This limit to our knowledge must be accepted and incorporated into our assessments, as several articles in this special issue explore. Traditional and modern methods to accelerate the gathering and sharing of this fundamental knowledge about species distribution and taxonomy, such as specimen digitization, both in the herbarium and the field, collected by both professionals and community scientists, in addition to machine learning techniques for species identification and trait characterization, are needed. An effort to prioritize which elements of the dark matter of conservation can be most effectively addressed and which will remain obscure should be examined in the context of each country's capacity and resources. Challenging theoretical questions also remain around our definition of the currency for all of these assessments: ""how do we meaningfully measure diversity?"". Currently, assessments are conducted on taxonomically recognized species, treating each as a distinct conservation and evolutionary units. Emerging evidence from genomic studies indicates that interspecific gene flow is a major element of species evolution and adaptation and given the very rapid pace of global change and the emerging of novel ecosystems. This interspecific gene flow is expected to occur and likely increase due to human activities. Understanding and incorporating this natural process will help us in planning and coordinating ecological restoration to more effectively to include numerous species as part of a suite of co-evolving taxa, instead of isolated units. Invasive pests and diseases are some of the major threats to tree species across the temperate northern hemisphere, illustrating an interesting dimension of threat as well. In contrast, threats from land conversion and logging impact species based on their rarity and are often indirect, resulting from the destruction of their habitat during timber harvest or land conversion. On the other hand, pests and diseases directly affect the species and can pose a greater threat to common trees. This illustrates the challenges of assessing threats that are not linked to rarity and determine how to manage them. As discussed in several articles of this special issue, deforestation and land conversion into intensive human use remain the biggest threats to tree species globally. Anthropogenic change is driving this very rapid transition from the ecological and evolutionary processes that generated earth's remarkable plant diversity to the intensive and often wasteful production of goods and services. The factors determining these changes are determined by global economies and national governments, which change quickly and without necessarily putting environmental protection at the top of their agenda. We need to assess these threats according to our ability to influence the improvement of the environmental circumstances that can protect and restore tree diversity. In line with the goals of the United Nations Decade on Ecosystem Restoration (https://www.decadeonrestoration.org/), we need to develop comprehensive strategy that outlines crucial steps, such as collecting the plant material, propagation, translocation, and restoration of the species and ecosystems they create. Here, we outline a plant diversity conservation network (Figure 2), where the four primary activities are defined as (1) Document, (2) Grow, (3) Plant, and (4) Manage. We use these terms broadly, so that any activity that relates to documentation, for example, from collecting the plant material to analyzing its genetic material, is included under that activity. Central all of these activities is collaboration and dialogue with information technology and creating, refining, and adopting advanced technologies wherever they are appropriate. These internal activities are further framed by four major external factors: (1) Reality, (2) Funding, (3) Sharing, and (4) Mentorship. The first two impinge upon the conservation activities occurring within the ecosystem while the second two determine the future success and acceptance of the conservation activities. Again, each one of these terms can be substantially elaborated and constitute their own ecosystems. This framing of the plant diversity conservation network allows each participant to focus their efforts on the activities where they have the most influence and to identify the partners which have the most natural and effective means of creating a synergistic effect. The geological concept of the Anthropocene is a compelling mindset from which to examine these issues. Humans have so fundamentally altered the major and minor cycles of nutrients, water, ecologies, and diversity, at global and local scales, that we must accept responsibility for maintaining plant diversity across the entire landscape, from urban centers to the deepest forest. Additionally, we need to do more than simply count our losses, we must anticipate and predict the effect of rapid change on both current and future plant diversity. Given the likely unprecedented and unpredictable environments and ecosystems of the future, current diversity will be challenged to adapt and respond. We need to explore the major activities of the plant diversity conservation ecosystem outlined above in order to determine what will most effectively safeguard the future of plant diversity. We have considerable leverage in all four major activities, but much work and improvement remains to be accomplished. First, the documentation, collection, and analysis of existing diversity need to be accelerated. Much of tree diversity is poorly known, as evidenced here, and we should utilize the latest technologies and approaches to capture its variation, distribution, and history. We also need to utilize advanced modelling techniques, to understand species distributions and how environmental change affects them. This will help us to understand the maintenance of diversity, both genetic and functional, in populations. Second, the power and importance of our ability to grow plant diversity cannot be overstated. We learn a great deal about plant diversity when we grow and propagate it. We also need this plant diversity as stock for future plantings. Finally, this element of the conservation network is one that botanical gardens can most directly control: a real emphasis on ex-situ conservation and propagation is needed to produce the diverse living material for ecosystem restoration projects we envision. We can secure the tenure of our living collections and sustain plant populations given a relatively small number of individuals. Finally, we need to recognize what elements of the network we have little to no control over and engage with actors who do, if any exist. External factors ultimately determine the success of our plant diversity conservation activities and means of integrating and influencing these factors must be recognized from the outset. The recent Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (https://www.cbd.int/gbf/) has highlighted the need for urgent management actions to prevent human-induced extinction of threatened species, through in situ and ex situ conservation and sustainable management practices, and tree conservation ought to be placed at the forefront of these efforts.

rayyan-210750275,Modelling Animal Biodiversity Using Acoustic Monitoring and Deep Learning,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"For centuries researchers have used sound to monitor and study wildlife. Traditionally, conservationists have identified species by ear; however, it is now common to deploy audio recording technology to monitor animal and ecosystem sounds. Animals use sound for communication, mating, navigation and territorial defence. Animal sounds provide valuable information and help conservationists to quantify biodiversity. Acoustic monitoring has grown in popularity due to the availability of diverse sensor types which include camera traps, portable acoustic sensors, passive acoustic sensors, and even smartphones. Passive acoustic sensors are easy to deploy and can be left running for long durations to provide insights on habitat and the sounds made by animals and illegal activity. While this technology brings enormous benefits, the amount of data that is generated makes processing a time-consuming process for conservationists. Consequently, there is interest among conservationists to automatically process acoustic data to help speed up biodiversity assessments. Processing these large data sources and extracting relevant sounds from background noise introduces significant challenges. In this paper we outline an approach for achieving this using state of the art in machine learning to automatically extract features from time-series audio signals and modelling deep learning models to classify different bird species based on the sounds they make. The acquired bird songs are processed using mel-frequency cepstrum (MFC) to extract features which are later classified using a multilayer perceptron (MLP). Our proposed method achieved promising results with 0.74 sensitivity, 0.92 specificity and an accuracy of 0.74.","",https://doi.org/10.1109/ijcnn52387.2021.9534195,"",,

In contrast to NEON’s extensive use of automated instruments to collect environmental data, NEON’s biodiversity surveys are almost entirely conducted using traditional human‐centric field methods. We believe that the combination of instrumentation for remote data collection and machine learning models to process such data represents an important opportunity for NEON to expand the scope, scale, and usability of its biodiversity data collection while potentially reducing long‐term costs. In this manuscript, we first review the current status of instrument‐based biodiversity surveys within the NEON project and previous research at the intersection of biodiversity, instrumentation, and machine learning at NEON sites. We then survey methods that have been developed at other locations but could potentially be employed at NEON sites in future. Finally, we expand on these ideas in five case studies that we believe suggest particularly fruitful future paths for automated biodiversity measurement at NEON sites: acoustic recorders for sound‐producing taxa, camera traps for medium and large mammals, hydroacoustic and remote imagery for aquatic diversity, expanded remote and ground‐based measurements for plant biodiversity, and laboratory‐based imaging for physical specimens and samples in the NEON biorepository. Through its data science‐literate staff and user community, NEON has a unique role to play in supporting the growth of such automated biodiversity survey methods, as well as demonstrating their ability to help answer key ecological questions that cannot be answered at the more limited spatiotemporal scales of human‐driven surveys.","",https://doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.3795,"",,
rayyan-210750380,Optimising biodiversity protection through artificial intelligence,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract Over a million species face extinction, carrying with them untold options for food, medicine, fibre, shelter, ecological resilience, aesthetic and cultural values. There is therefore an urgent need to design conservation policies that maximise the protection of biodiversity and its contributions to people, within the constraints of limited budgets. Here we present a novel framework for spatial conservation prioritisation that combines simulation models, reinforcement learning and ground validation to identify optimal policies. Our methodology, CAPTAIN (Conservation Area Prioritisation Through Artificial Intelligence Networks), quantifies the trade-off between the costs and benefits of area and biodiversity protection, allowing the exploration of multiple biodiversity metrics. Under a fixed budget, our model protects substantially more species from extinction than the random or naively targeted protection of areas. CAPTAIN also outperforms the most widely used software for spatial conservation prioritisation (Marxan) in 97% of cases and reduces species loss by an average of 40% under simulations, besides yielding prioritisation maps at substantially higher spatial resolution using empirical data. We find that regular biodiversity monitoring, even if simple and with a degree of inaccuracy – characteristic of citizen science surveys – substantially improves biodiversity outcomes. Given the complexity of people–nature interactions and wealth of associated data, artificial intelligence holds great promise for improving the conservation of biological and ecosystem values in a rapidly changing and resource-limited world.","",https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.13.439752,"",,
rayyan-210750385,"Modelling Animal Biodiversity Using Acoustic Monitoring and Deep
  Learning",,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"For centuries researchers have used sound to monitor and study wildlife. Traditionally, conservationists have identified species by ear; however, it is now common to deploy audio recording technology to monitor animal and ecosystem sounds. Animals use sound for communication, mating, navigation and territorial defence. Animal sounds provide valuable information and help conservationists to quantify biodiversity. Acoustic monitoring has grown in popularity due to the availability of diverse sensor types which include camera traps, portable acoustic sensors, passive acoustic sensors, and even smartphones. Passive acoustic sensors are easy to deploy and can be left running for long durations to provide insights on habitat and the sounds made by animals and illegal activity. While this technology brings enormous benefits, the amount of data that is generated makes processing a time-consuming process for conservationists. Consequently, there is interest among conservationists to automatically process acoustic data to help speed up biodiversity assessments. Processing these large data sources and extracting relevant sounds from background noise introduces significant challenges. In this paper we outline an approach for achieving this using state of the art in machine learning to automatically extract features from time-series audio signals and modelling deep learning models to classify different bird species based on the sounds they make. The acquired bird songs are processed using mel-frequency cepstrum (MFC) to extract features which are later classified using a multilayer perceptron (MLP). Our proposed method achieved promising results with 0.74 sensitivity, 0.92 specificity and an accuracy of 0.74.","",,"",,
rayyan-210750417,Deep learning assessment of cultural ecosystem services from social media images,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"ABSTRACT Crowdsourced social media data has become popular in the assessment of cultural ecosystem services (CES). Advances in deep learning show great potential for the timely assessment of CES at large scales. Here, we describe a procedure for automating the assessment of image elements pertaining to CES from social media. We focus on a binary (natural, human) and a multiclass (posing, species, nature, landscape, human activities, human structures) classification of those elements using two Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs; VGG16 and ResNet152) with the weights from two large datasets - Places365 and ImageNet -, and our own dataset. We train those CNNs over Flickr and Wikiloc images from the Peneda-Gerês region (Portugal) and evaluate their transferability to wider areas, using Sierra Nevada (Spain) as test. CNNs trained for Peneda-Gerês performed well, with results for the binary classification (F1-score &gt; 80%) exceeding those for the multiclass classification (&gt; 60%). CNNs pre-trained with Places365 and ImageNet data performed significantly better than with our data. Model performance decreased when transferred to Sierra Nevada, but their performances were satisfactory (&gt; 60%). The combination of manual annotations, freely available CNNs and pre-trained local datasets thereby show great relevance to support automated CES assessments from social media.","",https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.23.449176,"",,
rayyan-210750577,DiversityScanner: Robotic discovery of small invertebrates with machine learning methods,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"ABSTRACT Invertebrate biodiversity remains poorly explored although it comprises much of the terrestrial animal biomass, more than 90% of the species-level diversity and supplies many ecosystem services. The main obstacle is specimen- and species-rich samples. Traditional sorting techniques require manual handling and are slow while molecular techniques based on metabarcoding struggle with obtaining reliable abundance information. Here we present a fully automated sorting robot, which detects each specimen, images and measures it before moving it from a mixed invertebrate sample to the well of a 96-well microplate in preparation for DNA barcoding. The images are then used by a newly trained convolutional neural network (CNN) to assign the specimens to 14 particularly common, usually family-level “classes” of insects in Malaise trap samples and an “other-class” (N=15). The average assignment precision for the classes is 91.4% (75-100%). In order to obtain biomass information, the specimen images are also used to measure specimen length and estimate body volume. We outline how the DiversityScanner robot can be a key component for tackling and monitoring invertebrate diversity. The robot generates large numbers of images that become training sets for CNNs once the images are labelled with identifications based on DNA barcodes. In addition, the robot allows for taxon-specific subsampling of large invertebrate samples by only removing the specimens that belong to one of the 14 classes. We conclude that a combination of automation, machine learning, and DNA barcoding has the potential to tackle invertebrate diversity at an unprecedented scale.","",https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.17.444523,"",,
rayyan-210750596,Integrating Multi-Sensors Data for Species Distribution Mapping Using Deep Learning and Envelope Models,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"The integration of ecological and atmospheric characteristics for biodiversity management is fundamental for long-term ecosystem conservation and drafting forest management strategies, especially in the current era of climate change. The explicit modelling of regional ecological responses and their impact on individual species is a significant prerequisite for any adaptation strategy. The present study focuses on predicting the regional distribution of Rhododendron arboreum, a medicinal plant species found in the Himalayan region. Advanced Species Distribution Models (SDM) based on the principle of predefined hypothesis, namely BIOCLIM, was used to model the potential distribution of Rhododendron arboreum. This hypothesis tends to vary with the change in locations, and thus, robust models are required to establish nonlinear complex relations between the input parameters. To address this nonlinear relation, a class of deep neural networks, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture is proposed, designed, and tested, which eventually gave much better accuracy than the BIOCLIM model. Both of the models were given 16 input parameters, including ecological and atmospheric variables, which were statistically resampled and were then utilized in establishing the linear and nonlinear relationship to better fit the occurrence scenarios of the species. The input parameters were mostly acquired from the recent satellite missions, including MODIS, Sentinel-2, Sentinel-5p, the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM), and ECOSTRESS. The performance across all the thresholds was evaluated using the value of the Area Under Curve (AUC) evaluation metrics. The AUC value was found to be 0.917 with CNN, whereas it was 0.68 with BIOCLIM, respectively. The performance evaluation metrics indicate the superiority of CNN for species distribution over BIOCLIM.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/rs13163284,"",,
rayyan-210750862,"Trees, society, and the path toward resilient ecosystems",,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Over 3 trillion trees occupy the Earth's land surface, mostly in tropical and subtropical forests. These trees provide vital ecosystem services, such as climate regulation, carbon sequestration, and habitat and food provision. Trees are also deeply interconnected with humans, offering social and cultural values. The interdependence between trees and humans underlines the urgency to understand and protect trees in both natural and urban ecosystems amid climate change and other environmental pressures, including deforestation, land degradation, and pollution. This virtual issue examines five critical themes of trees and forests and their societal impact. Over 3 trillion trees occupy the Earth's land surface, mostly in tropical and subtropical forests (~1.3 trillion) (Crowther et al., 2015). These trees provide vital ecosystem services, such as climate regulation, carbon sequestration, and habitat and food provision (Brockerhoff et al., 2017; Myers, 1997). Trees are also deeply interconnected with humans, offering social and cultural values (O'Brien, 2005). The interdependence between trees and humans underlines the urgency to understand and protect trees in both natural and urban ecosystems amid climate change and other environmental pressures, including deforestation, land degradation, and pollution (De Marco et al., 2022; Esperon-Rodriguez, Tjoelker, et al., 2022; Kumar et al., 2022; Lindner et al., 2010). This virtual issue examines five critical themes of trees and forests and their societal impact. Each theme provides insights into cultural significance, ecosystem contributions, resilience and restoration, and technological innovations in conservation. In 'Climate Resilience and Adaptive Strategies of Trees', researchers investigate how trees adapt to climate change through resilience and genetic diversity with studies on urban forest adaptation, genetic variation, and seasonal responses of tree species. 'Forest Restoration and Biodiversity Conservation' shows strategies that enhance biodiversity and climate mitigation with diverse reforestation practices. In 'Trees and Human Culture', the research explores the cultural value of trees, focusing on the historical and societal importance of native and commercial species and their role in local traditions and economies. The authors of work featured in 'Trees as Ecosystem Engineers' highlight how trees contribute to biodiversity and support livelihoods, with studies on societal perceptions, species interactions, and endemic conservation efforts. Lastly, 'Technological Advances in Forest Monitoring and Conservation' delves into tools like UAVs and genetic analyses that aid in monitoring and preserving forests. Together, these themes offer a comprehensive view of trees' essential roles across ecosystems, human culture, and emerging conservation efforts. As a response to climate change and urbanization, researchers highlight the need to enhance urban forest resilience. Urban forests, essential for decreasing urban heat and improving air quality and human well-being (Keeler et al., 2019), face risks from climate-induced stress. To secure the provision of these benefits to urban residents, Esperon-Rodriguez, Rymer, et al. (2022) emphasize the importance of selecting tree species suited to the projected climate conditions in cities along with other desirable characteristics, such as aesthetic value and biodiversity support. By assessing the risks to heat, drought, and pest outbreaks, urban planners can make informed decisions to increase the longevity of urban trees and secure the services they provide (Esperon-Rodriguez, Rymer, et al., 2022). Urban environments present unique challenges and opportunities for tree resilience. Sjöman et al. (2024) examined how genetic diversity within tree species (i.e., intraspecific variation) supports resilience to urban stresses, such as pollution and limited water availability. The authors suggest that by focusing on resilient tree varieties, urban forestry initiatives can improve biodiversity and ecosystem function within cities, fostering healthier urban landscapes that also contribute to climate resilience. Species, however, respond differently to local environmental conditions. For example, Goessen et al. (2022) explored how tree species have diverse adaptations driven by geographic conditions. Their study focused on Populus tremuloides, or Quaking aspen, a species native to North America, has developed divergent strategies in response to local environmental constraints, reflecting the role of genetic diversity in resilience. In Japan, Miyawaki-Kuwakado et al. (2024) investigated how warming temperatures affect the timing of seasonal events like bud dormancy. Their research on the iconic Yoshino cherry tree (Cerasus × yedoensis) showed that climate change may lead to mistimed flowering. Such shifts threaten species reliant on specific climatic triggers, raising concerns about the long-term viability of temperature-sensitive species in changing climates. Importantly, these changes can also have socio-economic disruptions, as the blossoming of cherries is an important tourism resource (Murata et al., 2012). Similar results were found in the Singapore Botanic Gardens, where Ho et al. (2024) conducted a long-term assessment of changes in leafing behavior of tropical trees in response to climate change. They found that tropical trees can adjust their leafing behavior over extended periods, showcasing their adaptive capacity. By focusing on adaptive capacity, genetic diversity, and optimal species selection, this research offers pathways to enhance forest resilience and sustain the ecological and social benefits that trees provide. Forest restoration plays a critical role in climate change mitigation and biodiversity conservation as global efforts aim to reverse deforestation and land degradation (Bastin et al., 2019). Andres et al. (2023) sought to define the term ""biodiverse reforestation"" and explained why this matters for climate change mitigation and biodiversity. The authors emphasize the importance of integrating biodiversity goals into reforestation efforts. By prioritizing species diversity, reforestation projects can sequester carbon more effectively while supporting ecosystem functions and species. This represents a more resilient and sustainable approach to forest restoration. Importantly, the authors consider the potential for improving scientific approaches to biodiverse reforestation with First Nations perspectives. The co-benefits of Indigenous knowledge and values have been recognized as vital to climate adaptation (Nursey-Bray et al., 2022). In restoration, ensuring water efficiency in seedlings is crucial, especially under climate stress. Krishnan et al. (2023) examined how organic nitrogen can enhance water-use efficiency in tropical tree seedlings. They showed that nutrient addition allowed seedlings to establish more effectively under dry conditions, suggesting practical strategies for forest restoration projects in arid regions. This has important repercussions not only for restoration but also for food production. For example, in regions where food security and forest health are closely linked, selecting appropriate tree species is essential. A study in Burkina Faso, West Africa, by Vinceti et al. (2022) explored how tree species contribute to both ecological restoration and local nutrition. By including species that provide food, like fruit-bearing trees, reforestation initiatives in Burkina Faso can address both environmental and community needs, creating landscapes that support biodiversity while improving food security. Local and small-scale efforts, such as home gardens, also play a significant role in supporting biodiversity and for conservation. Offord and Zimmer (2024) studied how home gardeners help preserve the critically endangered Wollemi Pine (Wollemia nobilis). This species native to Australia was described as new to science in 1994 and is represented by fewer than 100 individuals (Trueman et al., 2007). By cultivating Wollemi Pine in private gardens, individuals contribute to broader conservation goals, ensuring genetic diversity and supporting efforts to reintroduce the species into its natural habitat (Offord & Zimmer, 2024). This approach highlights the value of community-based conservation in supporting endangered species and enhancing biodiversity. Trees and forests have profound cultural and economic value, reflecting centuries of human interaction and local knowledge (O'Brien, 2005). Recent research investigates the cultural, economic, and social significance of tree species, focusing on the importance of identity, naming, and preservation of species. Dunbar-Wallis et al. (2023) highlight the significance of preserving historic North American apple (Malus domestica) varieties. Their study showed how naming and identifying these apples maintain cultural heritage and biodiversity. North American apples represent historical practices and tastes, underscoring the importance of preserving these genetic resources as part of local identity and resilience. Notably, M. domestica is one of the most cultivated fruits worldwide (ranked fourth) with an average annual production of over 85 million tons globally (FAOSTAT, 2020). For the wild apple (Malus sylvestris), Ruhsam et al. (2023) took the challenge of accurately identifying the nursery stock sold in nurseries from the United Kingdom. Wild apple species are vital for genetic diversity and resilience, and ensuring authenticity in nursery stock is crucial for conservation. This research highlights the importance of preserving genetic integrity and maintaining access to wild species, which are valuable for both biodiversity and cultural heritage. Studying a culturally significant species, the barnī date palm variety, a local elite variety of al-'Ulā oasis in Saudi Arabia, Gros-Balthazard et al. (2023) found that this variety is not only an economic staple but also a cultural icon in the region. Through its name and cultivation, the barnī date palm represents a rich heritage that has sustained communities for generations, illustrating how plant varieties can embody place-based knowledge and cultural ties. In a similar study, Gurung et al. (2024) explored the cultural and medicinal significance of Buddleja asiatica, a shrub native to the East Indies. In the Pan-Himalayan region, this species is integral to local healthcare practices, providing essential medicinal benefits to communities. Its use reflects a traditional knowledge system and highlights the symbiotic relationship between people and native plant species, demonstrating the role of trees in supporting cultural identity and local health. Trees as ecosystem engineers (i.e., organisms responsible for the creation and maintenance of habitats; Jones et al., 1996) can change the abiotic context upon which biotic interactions depend (Byers et al., 2006). Thus, community livelihoods rely on identifying threats and benefits provided by trees. Tsvuura et al. (2023) explored gender perspectives on the perceived benefits and threats of tree restoration in South Africa. They explored how communities view trees as valuable contributors to their livelihoods, recognizing the critical role trees play in providing resources such as timber, fruit, and medicinal products. However, this study also highlights concerns regarding threats to these benefits, such as climate change, deforestation, and urbanization. These threats challenge the sustainability of the services that communities depend on, underscoring the need for strategies that secure tree resources while balancing conservation and economic needs (Sivakumar et al., 2024). In Yemen, Maděra et al. (2024) studied 11 endemic frankincense tree (Boswellia) taxa in the Socotra Archipelago. These species are culturally and economically valuable to local communities. However, frankincense trees are also threatened by overharvesting, habitat loss, and climate change, threatening local biodiversity and the communities reliant on them for livelihood. Maděra et al.'s study provides a detailed ecological assessment identifying regions at most risk and offers insights into conservation strategies that balance sustainable use with the preservation of genetic diversity. The conservation of frankincense trees is critical not only for the ecosystem but also for supporting traditional practices and economic stability for people in the region. As hosts for other species, trees can develop complex interactions, such as the relationship between strangler figs and their host trees, studied by Mo et al. (2024). Strangler figs start life on host trees, gradually growing and often overtaking the host tree's structure. While this interaction may seem parasitic, it can enhance urban green spaces by adding unique biodiversity and aesthetic value. This study suggests that, when managed properly, strangler figs can enrich urban ecosystems by creating microhabitats for multiple species, supporting urban biodiversity, and improving the resilience of green spaces (Mo et al., 2024). This research highlights the dual ecological and cultural significance of these trees in urban landscapes. Modern technologies like AI, UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles), and genetic tools are shaping a new era in the conservation, management, and monitoring of forests worldwide. By combining UAV surveys, genetic analysis, advanced forestry tools, and ground-based monitoring, researchers and managers can make informed decisions about forest conservation and sustainable use. These technologies not only improve our understanding of forest ecosystems but also facilitate enforcing regulations, planning conservation strategies, and adapting to climate change impacts on forests. In Madagascar, Williams (2024) used UAVs to monitor deforestation in real-time. Madagascar harbors a unique biodiversity, but this is threatened by illegal logging (Ralimanana et al., 2022). UAVs enable rapid, cost-effective detection of deforestation, offering precise data on forest loss and allowing authorities to respond promptly to illegal activities (Williams, 2024). In a global review of emerging tools to support sustainable forestry, Bunney et al. (2023) focused on protecting sandalwood species (a variety of species in the family Santalaceae), which are culturally and economically valuable and threatened by overharvesting. This review examined different methods, including DNA barcoding, to verify the species of harvested wood and remote sensing for forest monitoring. Together, these studies demonstrate the importance of combining drones, remote sensing, and genetic tools for comprehensive forest conservation strategies. The role of genomics in understanding the resilience of tree species was studied by Kong et al. (2023). Prosopis alba, native to arid environments, possesses genetic traits that allow it to withstand extreme drought and saline conditions. By mapping the genome of P. alba, Kong et al. demonstrated species adaptability, which can inform breeding programs aimed at enhancing the resilience of trees in regions facing water scarcity and climate stress. Genomic tools enable targeted conservation of tree species that are vital to ecosystem stability in extreme climates (Isabel et al., 2020). Finally, in a study using ground-based data, Anderson-Teixeira et al. (2024) showed that effective forest carbon inventories require precise measurements of carbon stocks. Technologies such as remote sensing paired with field data can provide reliable estimates. This approach enhances the accuracy of reporting forest carbon, helping countries meet their climate goals and track the effectiveness of conservation efforts. Collectively, these studies show the essential roles that trees play in both natural and urban environments, particularly in the face of climate change and environmental pressures. They reveal how trees adapt to climate changes, underscoring the importance of genetic diversity and adaptive strategies to strengthen climate-resilient forestry. This knowledge supports informed species selection and management to foster resilient forests that benefit both ecosystems and communities. A multi-faceted approach to forest restoration, one that incorporates ecological, cultural, and social factors, emerges as crucial for sustaining biodiversity while meeting community needs. These studies highlight trees as cultural symbols and economic resources, essential for preserving cultural identity and biodiversity. Trees also serve as ecosystem engineers, offering ecosystem services that support biodiversity, air quality, and water regulation, while facing significant threats from human impact. Notably, technological advancements and emerging tools are transforming forest conservation and monitoring, providing researchers with tools to better protect and manage forest ecosystems. Together, these studies provide insights and innovations toward more sustainable and resilient ecosystems that benefit both the environment and society. MER wrote this article.

rayyan-210751050,Tree Species Mapping on Sentinel-2 Satellite Imagery with Weakly Supervised Classification and Object-Wise Sampling,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Information on forest composition, specifically tree types and their distribution, aids in timber stock calculation and can help to better understand the biodiversity in a particular region. Automatic satellite imagery analysis can significantly accelerate the process of tree type classification, which is traditionally carried out by ground-based observation. Although computer vision methods have proven their efficiency in remote sensing tasks, specific challenges arise in forestry applications. The forest inventory data often contain the tree type composition but do not describe their spatial distribution within each individual stand. Therefore, some pixels can be assigned a wrong label in the semantic segmentation task if we consider each stand to be homogeneously populated by its dominant species. Another challenge is the spatial distribution of individual stands within the study area. Classes are usually imbalanced and distributed nonuniformly that makes sampling choice more critical. This study aims to enhance tree species classification based on a neural network approach providing automatic markup adjustment and improving sampling technique. For forest species markup adjustment, we propose using a weakly supervised learning approach based on the knowledge of dominant species content within each stand. We also propose substituting the commonly used CNN sampling approach with the object-wise one to reduce the effect of the spatial distribution of forest stands. We consider four species commonly found in Russian boreal forests: birch, aspen, pine, and spruce. We use imagery from the Sentinel-2 satellite, which has multiple bands (in the visible and infrared spectra) and a spatial resolution of up to 10 meters. A data set of images for Leningrad Oblast of Russia is used to assess the methods. We demonstrate how to modify the training strategy to outperform a basic CNN approach from F1-score 0.68 to 0.76. This approach is promising for future studies to obtain more specific information about stands composition even using incomplete data.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/f12101413,"",,
rayyan-210751071,A comprehensive comparison on current deep learning approaches for plant image classification,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract Plant identification and classification play a key role in understanding, protecting and conserving biodiversity. Traditional plant taxonomy needs long time intensive training and experience, which limited others to identify plant categories. With the development of automated image-based classification, machine learning (ML) is becoming a popular tool. Image classification, especially plant images taxonomy, has achieved great improvement in these years by deep learning (DL) methods. In this study, we first reviewed current deep learning applications in the field of plant image classification, and then we tested six deep learning methods in four public plant image datasets. In order to test the classification power of DL methods at cultivar level, we prepared a Camellia sasanqua Thunb. dataset, which is called Camellia@clab, for assessing classification performance of the six DL methods. These DL models’ classification performance all exceeded 70% in the four public plant image datasets, and LeNet and DenseNet had stable good performance, with median prediction accuracy of the LeNet was over 87.29% and that of DenseNet was over 93.8% in the four public datasets at species level. At cultivar level, the lowest median prediction accuracy of those DL methods decreased to 62%, but LeNet and DenseNet still performed very well. The prediction accuracy of LeNet and DenseNet was 82.3% and 100% in the Camellia@clab dataset, respectively. DenseNet model showed a stable best classification performance among the five datasets. To our knowledge, this is the first study that provides a comprehensive review and comparison on applying current DL methods to plant image classification. This study will provide guidance for DL applications in plant image classification, and point out the protentional DL research direction for modeling improvement.","",https://doi.org/10.1088/1742-6596/1873/1/012002,"",,
rayyan-210751233,AI-based Identification of Plant Photographs from Herbarium Specimens,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Automated plant identification has recently improved significantly due to advances in deep learning and the availability of large amounts of field photos. As an illustration, the classification accuracy of 10K species measured in the LifeCLEF challenge (Goëau et al. 2018) reached 90%, very close to that of human experts. However, the profusion of field images only concerns a few tens of thousands of species, mainly located in North America and Western Europe. Conversely, the richest regions in terms of biodiversity, such as tropical countries, suffer from a shortage of training data (Pitman 2021). Consequently, the identification performance of the most advanced models on the flora of these regions is much lower (Goëau et al. 2019). Nevertheless, for several centuries, botanists have systematically collected, catalogued, and stored plant specimens in herbaria. Considerable recent efforts by the biodiversity informatics community, such as DiSSCo (Addink et al. 2018) and iDigBio (Matsunaga et al. 2013), have made millions of digitized specimens from these collections available online. A key question is therefore whether these digitized specimens could be used to improve the identification performance of species for which we have very few (if any) photos. However, this is a very difficult problem from a machine learning point of view. The visual appearance of a herbarium specimen is actually very different from a field photograph because the specimens are dried and crushed on a herbarium sheet before being digitized (Fig. 1). To advance research on this topic, we built a large dataset that we shared as one of the challenges of the LifeCLEF 2020 (Goëau et al. 2020) and 2021 evaluation campaigns (Goëau et al. 2021). It includes more than 320K herbarium specimens collected mostly from the Guiana Shield and the Northern Amazon Rainforest, focusing on about 1K plant species of the French Guiana flora. A valuable asset of this collection is that some of the specimens are accompanied by a few photos of the same specimen, allowing for more precise machine learning. In addition to this training data, we also built a test set for model evaluation, composed of 3,186 field photos collected by two of the best experts on Guyanese flora. Based on this dataset, about ten research teams have developed deep learning methods to address the challenge (including the authors of this abstract as the organizing team). A detailed description of these methods can be found in the technical notes written by the participating teams (Goëau et al. 2020, Goëau et al. 2021). The methods can be divided into two categories: those based on classical convolutional neural networks (CNN) trained simply by mixing digitized specimens and photos and those based on advanced domain adaptation techniques with the objective of learning a joint representation space between field and herbarium representations. those based on classical convolutional neural networks (CNN) trained simply by mixing digitized specimens and photos and those based on advanced domain adaptation techniques with the objective of learning a joint representation space between field and herbarium representations. The domain adaptation methods themselves were of two types, those based on adversarial regularization (Motiian et al. 2017) to force herbarium specimens and photos to have the same representations, metric learning to maximize inter-species distances and minimize intra-species distances in the representation space adversarial regularization (Motiian et al. 2017) to force herbarium specimens and photos to have the same representations, metric learning to maximize inter-species distances and minimize intra-species distances in the representation space In Table 1, we report the results achieved by the different methods evaluated during the 2020 edition of the challenge. The evaluation metric used is the mean reciprocal rank (MRR), i.e., the average of the inverse of the rank of the correct species in the list of the predicted species. In addition to this main score, a second MRR score is computed on a subset of the test set composed of the most difficult species, i.e., the ones that are the least frequently photographed in the field. The main outcomes we can derive from these results are the following: Classical deep learning models fail to identify plant photos from digitized herbarium specimens. The best classical CNN trained on the provided data resulted in a very low MRR score (0.011). Even with the of use additional training data (e.g. photos and digitized herbarium from GBIF) the MRR score remains very low (0.039). Domain adaptation methods provide significant improvement but the task remains challenging. The best MRR score (0.180) was achieved by using adversarial regularization (FSDA Motiian et al. 2017). This is much better than the classical CNN models but there is still a lot of progress to be made to reach the performance of a truly functional identification system (the MRR score on classical plant identification tasks can be up to 0.9). No method fits all. As shown in Table 1, the metric learning method has a significantly better MRR score on the most difficult species (0.107). However, the performance of this method on the species with more photos is much lower than the adversarial technique. In 2021, the challenge was run again but with additional information provided to train the models, i.e., species traits (plant life form, woodiness and plant growth form). The use of the species traits allowed slight performance improvement of the best adversarial adaptation method (with a MRR equal to 0.198). In conclusion, the results of the experiments conducted are promising and demonstrate the potential interest of digitized herbarium data for automated plant identification. However, progress is still needed before integrating this type of approach into production applications.","",https://doi.org/10.3897/biss.5.73751,"",,
rayyan-210751353,Image-based taxonomic classification of bulk biodiversity samples using deep learning and domain adaptation,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"ABSTRACT Complex bulk samples of invertebrates from biodiversity surveys present a great challenge for taxonomic identification, especially if obtained from unexplored ecosystems. High-throughput imaging combined with machine learning for rapid classification could overcome this bottleneck. Developing such procedures requires that taxonomic labels from an existing source data set are used for model training and prediction of an unknown target sample. Yet the feasibility of transfer learning for the classification of unknown samples remains to be tested. Here, we assess the efficiency of deep learning and domain transfer algorithms for family-level classification of below-ground bulk samples of Coleoptera from understudied forests of Cyprus. We trained neural network models with images from local surveys versus global databases of above-ground samples from tropical forests and evaluated how prediction accuracy was affected by: (a) the quality and resolution of images, (b) the size and complexity of the training set and (c) the transferability of identifications across very disparate source-target pairs that do not share any species or genera. Within-dataset classification accuracy reached 98% and depended on the number and quality of training images and on dataset complexity. The accuracy of between-datasets predictions was reduced to a maximum of 82% and depended greatly on the standardisation of the imaging procedure. When the source and target images were of similar quality and resolution, albeit from different faunas, the reduction of accuracy was minimal. Application of algorithms for domain adaptation significantly improved the prediction performance of models trained by non-standardised, low-quality images. Our findings demonstrate that existing databases can be used to train models and successfully classify images from unexplored biota, when the imaging conditions and classification algorithms are carefully considered. Also, our results provide guidelines for data acquisition and algorithmic development for high-throughput image-based biodiversity surveys.","",https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.12.22.473797,"",,
rayyan-210751369,An Integrated Spectral–Structural Workflow for Invasive Vegetation Mapping in an Arid Region Using Drones,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Mapping invasive vegetation species in arid regions is a critical task for managing water resources and understanding threats to ecosystem services. Traditional remote sensing platforms, such as Landsat and MODIS, are ill-suited for distinguishing native and non-native vegetation species in arid regions due to their large pixels compared to plant sizes. Unmanned aircraft systems, or UAS, offer the potential to capture the high spatial resolution imagery needed to differentiate species. However, in order to extract the most benefits from these platforms, there is a need to develop more efficient and effective workflows. This paper presents an integrated spectral–structural workflow for classifying invasive vegetation species in the Lower Salt River region of Arizona, which has been the site of fires and flooding, leading to a proliferation of invasive vegetation species. Visible (RGB) and multispectral images were captured and processed following a typical structure from motion workflow, and the derived datasets were used as inputs in two machine learning classifications—one incorporating only spectral information and one utilizing both spectral data and structural layers (e.g., digital terrain model (DTM) and canopy height model (CHM)). Results show that including structural layers in the classification improved overall accuracy from 80% to 93% compared to the spectral-only model. The most important features for classification were the CHM and DTM, with the blue band and two spectral indices (normalized difference water index (NDWI) and normalized difference salinity index (NDSI)) contributing important spectral information to both models.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/drones5010019,"",,

To overcome these confounding factors, many biodiversity models employ species distribution models (SDMs) to predict the full extent of where a species lives, using observations of where a species has been found, correlated with environmental variables. Most SDMs use bioclimatic environmental variables as the dependent variable to predict a species’ range, but these approaches often rely on biased pseudo-absence generation methods and model species using coarse-grained bioclimatic variables with a useful resolution floor of 1 km-pixel.

Lack of species data can be overcome with remote sensing because it covers extended geographic areas and generates recurring data. We developed a Deep Learning (DL) framework using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) products and modeled potential species richness by stacking species distribution models (S-SDMs) to ask, “What are the spatial patterns of potential plant species richness across the Korean Peninsula, including inaccessible North Korea, where survey data are limited?” First, we estimated plant species richness in South Korea by combining the probability-based SDM results of 1574 species and used independent plant surveys to validate our potential species richness maps. Next, DL-based species richness models were fitted to the species richness results in South Korea, and a time-series of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and leaf area index (LAI) from MODIS. The individually developed models from South Korea were statistically tested using datasets that were not used in model training and obtained high accuracy outcomes (0.98, Pearson correlation). Finally, the proposed models were combined to estimate the richness patterns across the Korean Peninsula at a higher spatial resolution than the species survey data. From the statistical feature importance tests overall, growing season NDVI-related features were more important than LAI features for quantifying biodiversity from remote sensing time-series data.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/rs13132490,"",,
rayyan-210751786,Assessment of plant species distribution and diversity along a climatic gradient from Mediterranean woodlands to semi-arid shrublands,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Climate and land-use change profoundly affect plant species distribution (SD) and composition, and the impact of these processes is expected to increase in the coming years. As a proxy of global changes, knowledge of SD and diversity along climatic gradients is essential to determine the efforts needed for species conservation. Plant spectral diversity is an emerging approach used as a proxy for species diversity based on remote sensing. Thus, the research aim was to develop a comprehensive methodology based on spectral diversity for SD and richness mapping and to study their relations with environmental and human-derived factors, demonstrated along Mediterranean to semi-arid climatic gradient. The study addresses two main knowledge gaps regarding spectral diversity: (1) improving the accuracy of woody species classification by features extraction and selection, and by using texture analysis in an ecosystem characterized by high spatial variability and relatively small-sized and sparse woody vegetation; and (2) developing a better estimate of the local species ‎richness and their response to environmental and human-derived factors (i.e. climate, topography, substrate, and land cover factors) across a transition zone between Mediterranean woodlands and semi-arid dwarf shrublands. A hyperspectral image was acquired for a 43-km strip along the study area using an airborne flight of AISA-FENIX (380–2500 nm, 420 bands) at the end of the 2017 rainy season. The dominant species were surveyed, with a total number of 247 trees and shrubs, to train a machine learning support vector machine (SVM) classification for species distribution mapping, which yielded an overall accuracy of 86.1%. A feature extraction and selection methodology was developed, combining principal component analysis and neighborhood component analysis techniques, facilitating the identification of 33 spectral diagnostic bands out of 330 spectral bands. The classification accuracy was decreased by about 2% to 84.2% using only 33 spectral bands. The classification accuracy improved by about 7.1% for the seven large crown species (93.3%) by adding texture information. Later, the local species richness was calculated by utilizing the alpha diversity index (i.e. the Shannon Index) for 30-m grid cells and was tested in response to environmental (i.e. climate, substrate, and topography) and human-derived factors (i.e. land cover). The highest sensitivity to alpha diversity factors was mean annual precipitation, slope, and land surface temperature. The alpha diversity showed higher richness in the natural Mediterranean shrubland and the guarrigue located in the northern part of the climate gradient. We suggest that the approach presented here significantly improves the estimation of woody species distribution and diversity in areas characterized by high spatial heterogeneity along steep climatic gradients.","",https://doi.org/10.1080/15481603.2021.1953770,"",,
rayyan-210751839,TaxoNERD: deep neural models for the recognition of taxonomic entities in the ecological and evolutionary literature,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Given the biodiversity crisis, we more than ever need to access information on multiple taxa (e.g. distribution, traits, diet) in the scientific literature to understand, map and predict all-inclusive biodiversity. Tools are needed to automatically extract useful information from the ever-growing corpus of ecological texts and feed this information to open data repositories. A prerequisite is the ability to recognise mentions of taxa in text, a special case of named entity recognition (NER). In recent years, deep learning-based NER systems have become ubiquitous, yielding state-of-the-art results in the general and biomedical domains. However, no such tool is available to ecologists wishing to extract information from the biodiversity literature. We propose a new tool called TaxoNERD that provides two deep neural network (DNN) models to recognise taxon mentions in ecological documents. To achieve high performance, DNN-based NER models usually need to be trained on a large corpus of manually annotated text. Creating such a gold standard corpus (GSC) is a laborious and costly process, with the result that GSCs in the ecological domain tend to be too small to learn an accurate DNN model from scratch. To address this issue, we leverage existing DNN models pretrained on large biomedical corpora using transfer learning. The performance of our models is evaluated on four GSCs and compared to the most popular taxonomic NER tools. Our experiments suggest that existing taxonomic NER tools are not suited to the extraction of ecological information from text as they performed poorly on ecologically-oriented corpora, either because they do not take account of the variability of taxon naming practices, or because they do not generalise well to the ecological domain. Conversely, a domain-specific DNN-based tool like TaxoNERD outperformed the other approaches on an ecological information extraction task. Efforts are needed in order to raise ecological information extraction to the same level of performance as its biomedical counterpart. One promising direction is to leverage the huge corpus of unlabelled ecological texts to learn a language representation model that could benefit downstream tasks. These efforts could be highly beneficial to ecologists on the long term.","",https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.08.444426,"",,
rayyan-210751856,Customized e-floras: How to develop your own project on the Pl@ntNet platform,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Pl@ntnet is a citizen observatory that relies on artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to help people identify plants with their smartphones (Joly 2014). Over the past few years, Pl@ntNet has become one of the largest plant biodiversity observatories in the world with several million contributors (Bonnet 2020b). Based on user demands, a set of tools and services following the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) principles (Wilkinson 2016) were implemented to allow the development of e-floras. After a short description of the platform (see Joly (2015) and Joly (2016) for details), we present three complementary services dedicated to the customization of e-floras. The general workflow of Pl@ntNet can be divided into three main components. First, the Pl@ntNet mobile Android and iOS apps, dedicated to plant identification, allow both anonymous and authenticated users to take a picture of a plant, and to send it to a server for recognition at the species level. This recognition, which is performed by a convolutional neural network (Affouard 2017), allows the user to get a list of candidate species, each associated with a confidence score. The second component of Pl@ntNet's workflow is the enrichment of the database to improve the observation quality of the data collected. Because of the huge volume of data (over four million observations shared in 2020, Pl@ntNet statistics), this enrichment cannot be done solely by expert botanists. This is why various crowdsourcing mechanisms have been put in place allowing the collaborative curation of the data. The third part of the Pl@ntNet workflow is the exploitation of the database, which is made available for the needs of stakeholders such as researchers. For example, the recent sharing of Pl@ntNet data on GBIF's (Global Biodiversity Information Facility) platform, through two complementary datasets, has increased the benefit to the scientific community (examples are available here). To support the development of customized e-floras, three complementary concepts have been developed: micro-projects, groups, and monitoring work spaces, whose services are detailed below: (a) Micro-project s allow full adaptation of all the interfaces of the Pl@ntNet apps to a species list of interest. This e-flora can be linked to a specific geographical area, which allows it to be automatically selected according to the user's location. When several specific geographical areas overlap for a given geolocation, the smallest one is automatically selected. This adaptation increases the accuracy of the identification, as the number of potential species for a given identification request is reduced to the checklist of the micro-project (e.g., Bonnet (2020a)). Up to now, 12 micro-projects adapted to European, African or Asian contexts are running on the platform. A full description of this service is provided in Bonnet (2020c). The API (Application Programming Interface) for the identification service of each e-flora is available on My-Pl@ntNet. (b) Group s allow any user to create a private or public space on the platform (https://identify.plantnet.org/groups), to permit everyone to aggregate a part or all of their observations in the group. A group is ""observation-centered"" as opposed to a micro-project, which is species-centered. If the group is public, any authenticated user can join and contribute to it; if it is private, only users validated by the group's moderators can become members. When a group is restricted to a specific geographical zone (such as a school, city, or natural area), only observations found in that area are displayed in the group, contrary the micro-project. As all the group's observations can be downloaded (as tabbed or comma separated values) by any of the group's members, group features can be used to conduct statistical analyses on the data in order to study plant plots, plant phenology or user profiles. These groups are used by people who want to structure the activity of a group of people interested in monitoring the biodiversity of a given area, a taxonomical group, or a type of plant habitat. Over 260 groups have already been created by e.g., professional land managers, educators, and plant enthusiasts. (c) Monitoring work space s allows a given stakeholder to access all the observations and identification requests of a given species list in a particular area. Micro-projects and Groups only allow exploration of plant observations explicitly shared by the authenticated users. However, Pl@ntNet's database contains hundreds of millions of plant identification requests submitted by anonymous users. Monitoring work spaces was set up to allow access by land managers to this rich and important material. These work spaces provide the maps, the list of plant observations, and identification requests (with a very high confidence score on the species identification), for all the species of interest to a given partner. For example, this service has been mobilized to follow the recent development of an invasive species (i.e., Hakea sericea Schrad. &amp;amp; J.C. Wendl.) in and around a natural reserve on the Mediterranean coast. All of these on-demand e-floras and monitoring services accelerate the use of daily-produced data, and inform land managers and scientists of the changes in the floristic composition of monitoring areas.","",https://doi.org/10.3897/biss.5.73857,"",,

Threats to ecosystems can go undetected for years or decades as a result. Real-time data can help solve this issue but significant technical barriers exist. For example, automated camera traps are widely used for ecosystem monitoring but it is challenging to transmit images for real-time analysis where there is no reliable cellular or WiFi connectivity. Here, we present our design for a camera trap with integrated artificial intelligence that can send real-time information from anywhere in the world to end-users. We modified an off-the-shelf camera trap (Bushnell™) and customised existing open-source hardware to rapidly create a ‘smart’ camera trap system. Images captured by the camera trap are instantly labelled by an artificial intelligence model and an ‘alert’ containing the image label and other metadata is then delivered to the end-user within minutes over the Iridium satellite network. We present results from testing in the Netherlands, Europe, and from a pilot test in a closed-canopy forest in Gabon, Central Africa. Results show the system can operate for a minimum of three months without intervention when capturing a median of 17.23 images per day. The median time-difference between image capture and receiving an alert was 7.35 minutes. We show that simple approaches such as excluding ‘uncertain’ labels and labelling consecutive series of images with the most frequent class (vote counting) can be used to improve accuracy and interpretation of alerts. We anticipate significant developments in this field over the next five years and hope that the solutions presented here, and the lessons learned, can be used to inform future advances. New artificial intelligence models and the addition of other sensors such as microphones will expand the system’s potential for other, real-time use cases. Potential applications include, but are not limited to, wildlife tourism, real-time biodiversity monitoring, wild resource management and detecting illegal human activities in protected areas.","",https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.11.10.468078,"",,

In Kenya, Arid and Semi-arid Lands (ASAL) occupy 80% of the landscape and are critical for the livelihoods of millions of pastoralists. However, they have been invaded by Invasive Plant Species (IPS) thereby compromising their ecosystem functionality. Opuntia stricta, a well-known IPS, has invaded the ASAL in Kenya and poses a threat to pastoralism, leading to livestock mortality and land degradation. Thus, identification and detailed estimation of its cover is essential for drawing an effective management strategy. The study aimed at utilizing the Sentinel-2 multispectral sensor to detect Opuntia stricta in a heterogeneous ASAL in Laikipia County, using ensemble machine learning classifiers. To illustrate the potential of Sentinel-2, the detection of Opuntia stricta was based on only the spectral bands as well as in combination with vegetation and topographic indices using Extreme Gradient Boost (XGBoost) and Random Forest (RF) classifiers to detect the abundance. Study results showed that the overall accuracies of Sentinel 2 spectral bands were 80% and 84.4%, while that of combined spectral bands, vegetation, and topographic indices was 89.2% and 92.4% for XGBoost and RF classifiers, respectively. The inclusion of topographic indices that enhance characterization of biological processes, and vegetation indices that minimize the influence of soil and the effects of atmosphere, contributed by improving the accuracy of the classification. Qualitatively, Opuntia stricta spatially was found along river banks, flood plains, and near settlements but limited in forested areas. Our results demonstrated the potential of Sentinel-2 multispectral sensors to effectively detect and map Opuntia stricta in a complex heterogeneous ASAL, which can support conservation and rangeland management policies that aim to map and list threatened areas, and conserve the biodiversity and productivity of rangeland ecosystems.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/rs13081494,"",,

Based on an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Approach in Boreal Forests,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"European aspen (Populus tremula L.) is a keystone species for biodiversity of boreal forests. Large-diameter aspens maintain the diversity of hundreds of species, many of which are threatened in Fennoscandia. Due to a low economic value and relatively sparse and scattered occurrence of aspen in boreal forests, there is a lack of information of the spatial and temporal distribution of aspen, which hampers efficient planning and implementation of sustainable forest management practices and conservation efforts. Our objective was to assess identification of European aspen at the individual tree level in a southern boreal forest using high-resolution photogrammetric point cloud (PPC) and multispectral (MSP) orthomosaics acquired with an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The structure-from-motion approach was applied to generate RGB imagery-based PPC to be used for individual tree-crown delineation. Multispectral data were collected using two UAV cameras: Parrot Sequoia and MicaSense RedEdge-M. Tree-crown outlines were obtained from watershed segmentation of PPC data and intersected with multispectral mosaics to extract and calculate spectral metrics for individual trees. We assessed the role of spectral data features extracted from PPC and multispectral mosaics and a combination of it, using a machine learning classifier—Support Vector Machine (SVM) to perform two different classifications: discrimination of aspen from the other species combined into one class and classification of all four species (aspen, birch, pine, spruce) simultaneously. In the first scenario, the highest classification accuracy of 84% (F1-score) for aspen and overall accuracy of 90.1% was achieved using only RGB features from PPC, whereas in the second scenario, the highest classification accuracy of 86 % (F1-score) for aspen and overall accuracy of 83.3% was achieved using the combination of RGB and MSP features. The proposed method provides a new possibility for the rapid assessment of aspen occurrence to enable more efficient forest management as well as contribute to biodiversity monitoring and conservation efforts in boreal forests.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/rs13091723,"",,
rayyan-210752067,U-Infuse: Democratization of Customizable Deep Learning for Object Detection,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Image data is one of the primary sources of ecological data used in biodiversity conservation and management worldwide. However, classifying and interpreting large numbers of images is time and resource expensive, particularly in the context of camera trapping. Deep learning models have been used to achieve this task but are often not suited to specific applications due to their inability to generalise to new environments and inconsistent performance. Models need to be developed for specific species cohorts and environments, but the technical skills required to achieve this are a key barrier to the accessibility of this technology to ecologists. Thus, there is a strong need to democratize access to deep learning technologies by providing an easy-to-use software application allowing non-technical users to train custom object detectors. U-Infuse addresses this issue by providing ecologists with the ability to train customised models using publicly available images and/or their own images without specific technical expertise. Auto-annotation and annotation editing functionalities minimize the constraints of manually annotating and pre-processing large numbers of images. U-Infuse is a free and open-source software solution that supports both multiclass and single class training and object detection, allowing ecologists to access deep learning technologies usually only available to computer scientists, on their own device, customised for their application, without sharing intellectual property or sensitive data. It provides ecological practitioners with the ability to (i) easily achieve object detection within a user-friendly GUI, generating a species distribution report, and other useful statistics, (ii) custom train deep learning models using publicly available and custom training data, (iii) achieve supervised auto-annotation of images for further training, with the benefit of editing annotations to ensure quality datasets. Broad adoption of U-Infuse by ecological practitioners will improve ecological image analysis and processing by allowing significantly more image data to be processed with minimal expenditure of time and resources, particularly for camera trap images. Ease of training and use of transfer learning means domain-specific models can be trained rapidly, and frequently updated without the need for computer science expertise, or data sharing, protecting intellectual property and privacy.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/s21082611,"",,
rayyan-210752078,Camtrap DP: A frictionless data exchange format for camera trapping data,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Camera trapping is one of the most important technologies in conservation and ecological research and a well-established, non-invasive method of collecting field data on animal abundance, distribution, behaviour, temporal activity, and space use (Wearn and Glover-Kapfer 2019). Collectively, camera trapping projects are generating a massive and continuous flow of data, consisting of images and videos (with and without animal observations) and associated identifications (Scotson et al. 2017, Kays et al. 2020). In recent years, significant progress has been made by the global camera trapping community to resolve the challenges this brings, from the development of specialized data management tools and analytical packages, to the application of cloud computing and artificial intelligence to automate species recognition (Tabak et al. 2018). However, to effectively exchange camera trap data between infrastructures and to (automatically) harmonize data into large-scale wildlife datasets, there is a need for a common data exchange format—one that captures the essential information about a camera trap study, allows expression of different study and identification approaches, and aligns well with existing biodiversity standards such as Darwin Core (Wieczorek et al. 2012). Here we present Camera Trap Data Package (Camtrap DP), a data exchange format for camera trap data. It is managed by the Machine Observations Interest Group of Biodiversity Information Standards (TDWG) and developed publicly, soliciting community feedback for every change. Camtrap DP is built on Frictionless Standards, a set of generic specifications to describe and package (tabular) data and metadata. Camtrap DP extends these with specific requirements and constraints for camera trap data. By building on an existing framework, users can employ existing open source software to read and validate Camtrap DP formatted data. Validation especially is useful to automatically check if provided data meets the requirements set forth by Camtrap DP, before analysis or integration. Supported by the major camera trap data management systems e.g. Agouti, TRAPPER, eMammal, and Wildlife Insights, Camtrap DP is reaching its first stable version. The first Camtrap DP dataset was published on Zenodo (Cartuyvels et al. 2021b). This dataset was also published to the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) (Cartuyvels et al. 2021a), demonstrating the ability and limitations of transforming the data to the Darwin Core standard.","",https://doi.org/10.3897/biss.5.73188,"",,
rayyan-210752615,New trends in bioassessment of aquatic ecosystems: from organisms to DNA-based metrics,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Traditionally, the biological quality of aquatic ecosystems is assessed using selected groups of organisms that can be identified morphologically. Recent advances in high-throughput genomic approaches offered new opportunities to monitor biodiversity and assess ecological status using DNA barcoding and metabarcoding. The DNA-based tools have been used in three different ways: (1) to replace morphological identification of biological quality elements in existing biotic indices, (2) to develop new molecular indices based on morphologically inconspicuous groups of potential environmental indicators, and (3) to predict biotic indices from environmental DNA datasets using machine learning methods (Pawlowski et al. 2018). The next steps need to take advantages and challenges of these different approaches into account in view of their future application in routine bioassessment.The Working Group 2 of DNAqua-Net, Biotic Indices &amp;amp; Metrics, has worked with several task forces tackling different organism groups (fish, macroinvertebrates, diatoms, bacteria, protists, meiofauna), because challenges have been shown to be quite different dependent on the target organisms Kahlert et al. 2019. For the fish the eDNA-metabarcoding methods are well developed and give very good results in terms of species detection. The important question is to see if the semi-quantitative data retrieved from the metabarcoding (proportion in eDNA sequences) could be translated to proportions in biomass/numbers that are now used in many indices. The fish researchers are trying to fit these data in, but some correction factors might be needed to correct for differences between molecular and conventional methodsRegarding the macroinvertebrates, much discussion regarding index development was focusing on the importance of abundance measurements, and it was tested how existing indices would perform if barcoding data would be used instead of morphological data. Still discussion is ongoing on several technical issues, including the use of preservative for DNA extraction from bulk samples, the choice of primers for PCR amplification and the incompleteness of reference databases which impedes the correct assignment of eDNA sequences. Also minimum standards for routine operation are still missing.The diatom group has worked much on practical issues, starting a large initiative to compare diatom metabarcoding protocols used in routine freshwater biomonitoring for standardization (Bailet et al. 2019, Keck et al. 2018, Vasselon et al. 2017). With diatoms, all three approaches to develop molecular indices have been tested and seem promising, i.e. using existing indices with taxa names derived by matching sequences with reference databases, developing new indices based on molecular data only with traditional fixed scores, and using machine-learning techniques (Bailet et al. 2020, Vasselon et al. 2018, Tapolczai et al. 2019, Keck et al. 2018) The micro- and meiobiota group has worked towards an inclusion of microorganisms into aquatic assessment, because the microbial community dynamics are a missing link important for our understanding of rapid changes in the structure and function of aquatic ecosystems, and should be addressed in the future environmental monitoring of freshwater ecosystems (Sagova-Mareckova et al. 2021). Another focus was on how sediment DNA analysis can be integrated into stated goals of routine monitoring applications.

Machine learning approaches offer the tools to process, analyse and interpret large data sets, giving insights into trends and guiding evidence‐based allocation of limited resources to maximise positive biodiversity outcomes. Here we describe how data acquired from remote sensing, citizen science and other monitoring approaches could feed in near‐real time into an early warning system for biodiversity that integrates automated red‐listing of species with the identification of priority areas for conservation. Summary Application of machine learning approaches is aiding biodiversity conservation and research at a time of rapid global change. Two emerging topics and their data requirements are presented. First, to identify areas of priority protection for preventing biodiversity loss, reinforcement learning is used by training models that take into account human disturbance and climate change under recurrent monitoring schemes. Second, neural networks are used to approximate classification of species into Red List categories of the International Union for Conservation of Nature, offering the possibility of real‐time re‐classification after events such as widespread fires and deforestation. We discuss how the identification of areas and species most at risk could be integrated into an ‘early warning system’ based on climatic monitoring, remotely sensed land‐use changes and near‐real time biological and threat data from citizen science initiatives. Such system would help guide actions to prevent biodiversity loss at the speed required for effective conservation.","",https://doi.org/10.1002/ppp3.10337,"",,

However, fixed identification models only trained with standard datasets before their application will quickly reach their limits, especially for long-term monitoring with changing environmental conditions, varying visual appearances of individuals over time that differ a lot from those in the training data, and new occurring individuals that have not been observed before. Hence, we believe that active learning with human-in-the-loop and continuous lifelong learning is important to tackle these challenges and to obtain high-performance recognition systems when dealing with huge amounts of additional data that become available during the application. Our general approach with image features from deep neural networks and decoupled decision models can be applied to many different mammalian species and is perfectly suited for continuous improvements of the recognition systems via lifelong learning. In our identification experiments, we consider four different taxa, namely two elephant species: African forest elephants and Asian elephants, as well as two species of great apes: gorillas and chimpanzees. Going beyond classical re-identification, our decoupled approach can also be used for predicting attributes of individuals such as gender or age using classification or regression methods. Although applicable for small datasets of individuals as well, we argue that even better recognition performance will be achieved by improving decision models gradually via lifelong learning to exploit huge datasets and continuous recordings from long-term applications. We highlight that algorithms for deploying lifelong learning in real observational studies exist and are ready for use. Hence, lifelong learning might become a valuable concept that supports practitioners when analyzing large-scale image data during long-term monitoring of mammals.","",https://doi.org/10.1007/s42991-022-00224-8,"",,

The magnitude and diversity of these services are governed by tree species richness and structural complexity as essential regulators of forest biodiversity. Sound conservation and sustainable management strategies rely on information from biodiversity indicators that is conventionally derived by field-based, periodical inventory campaigns. However, these data are usually site-specific and not spatially explicit, hampering their use for large-scale monitoring applications. Therefore, the main objective of our study was to build a robust method for spatially explicit modeling of biodiversity variables across temperate forest types using open-access satellite data and deep learning models. Field data were obtained from the Biodiversity Exploratories, a research infrastructure platform that supports ecological research in Germany. A total of 150 forest plots were sampled between 2014 and 2018, covering a broad range of environmental and forest management gradients across Germany. From field data, we derived key indicators of tree species diversity (Shannon Wiener Index) and structural heterogeneity (standard deviation of tree diameter) as proxies of forest biodiversity. Deep neural networks were used to predict the selected biodiversity variables based on Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 images from 2017. Predictions of tree diameter variation achieved good accuracy (r2 = 0.51) using Sentinel-1 winter-based backscatter data. The best models of species diversity used a set of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 features but achieved lower accuracies (r2 = 0.25). Our results demonstrate the potential of deep learning and satellite remote sensing to predict forest parameters across a broad range of environmental and management gradients at the landscape scale, in contrast to most studies that focus on very homogeneous settings. These highly generalizable and spatially continuous models can be used for monitoring ecosystem status and functions, contributing to sustainable management practices, and answering complex ecological questions.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/rs14071631,"",,

They can not only beautify the urban environment but also help protect biodiversity and maintain ecological balance. Effective urban forest management is a basic requirement to ensure sustainable development. Traditional urban forest management usually requires the investment of a lot of materials and labor to conduct field research. RGB high-resolution aerial images have emerged as an efficient source of data for use in the detection and mapping of individual trees in urban areas. In recent years, there has been impressive progress in the field of deep learning methods for use in object detection. Semi-supervised learning is an effective way to deal with the problem that deep learning requires a large amount of labeled data. In this paper, we proposed an improved faster region-based convolutional neural network (Faster R-CNN) with Swin transformer method. Based on existing datasets, the model was trained and then transferred to new datasets. The method was evaluated within three distinct urban areas: a green space, a residential area and a suburban area. The experimental results indicate that our method achieved higher performance than other Faster R-CNN models. This method provides a reference in automated individual tree detection based on high-resolution images in urban areas for urban forestry managers.","",https://doi.org/10.1109/access.2022.3171585,"",,

Airborne and spaceborne platforms are the primary data sources for large-scale forest mapping, but visual interpretation for individual species determination is labour-intensive. Hence, various studies focusing on forests have investigated the benefits of multiple sensors for automated tree species classification. However, transferable deep learning approaches for large-scale applications are still lacking. This gap motivated us to create a novel dataset for tree species classification in Central Europe based on multi-sensor data from aerial, Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 imagery. In this paper, we introduce the TreeSatAI Benchmark Archive, which contains labels of 20 European tree species (i.e., 15 tree genera) derived from forest administration data of the federal state of Lower Saxony, Germany. We propose models and guidelines for the application of the latest machine learning techniques for the task of tree species classification with multi-label data. Finally, we provide various benchmark experiments showcasing the information which can be derived from the different sensors including artificial neural networks and tree-based machine learning methods. We found that residual neural networks (ResNet) perform sufficiently well with weighted precision scores up to 79 % only by using the RGB bands of aerial imagery. This result indicates that the spatial content present within the 0.2 m resolution data is very informative for tree species classification. With the incorporation of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 imagery, performance improved marginally. However, the sole use of Sentinel-2 still allows for weighted precision scores of up to 74 % using either multi-layer perceptron (MLP) or Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) models. Since the dataset is derived from real-world reference data, it contains high class imbalances. We found that this dataset attribute negatively affects the models' performances for many of the underrepresented classes (i.e., scarce tree species). However, the class-wise precision of the best performing late fusion model still reached values ranging from 54 % (Acer) to 88 % (Pinus). Based on our results, we conclude that deep learning techniques using aerial imagery could considerably support forestry administration in the provision of large-scale tree species maps at a very high resolution to plan for challenges driven by global environmental change.

This provides a huge opportunity in biodiversity and ecological research, but also creates challenges for efficient data handling and processing. Recreational and small-scale fisheries is one of the fields that could be revolutionised by efficient, widely accessible and machine learning-based processing of georeferenced images. Most non-commercial inland and coastal fisheries are considered data poor and are rarely assessed, yet they provide multiple societal benefits and can have substantial ecological impacts. Given that large quantities of georeferenced fish images are being collected by fishers every day, artificial intelligence (AI) and computer vision applications offer a great opportunity to automate their analyses by providing species identification, and potentially also fish size estimation. This would deliver data needed for fisheries management and fisher engagement. To date, however, many AI image analysis applications in fisheries are focused on the commercial sector, limited to specific species or settings, and are not publicly available. In addition, using AI and computer vision tools often requires a strong background in programming. In this study, we aim to facilitate broader use of computer vision tools in fisheries and ecological research by compiling an open-source user friendly and modular framework for large-scale image storage, handling, annotation and automatic classification, using cost- and labour-efficient methodologies. The tool is based on TensorFlow Lite Model Maker library, and includes data augmentation and transfer learning techniques applied to different convolutional neural network models. We demonstrate the potential application of this framework using a small example dataset of fish images taken through a recreational fishing smartphone application. The framework presented here can be used to develop region-specific species identification models, which could potentially be combined into a larger hierarchical model.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/su142114324,"",,

Indeed, the analysis of eDNA in conjunction with the collection of multidisciplinary optoacoustic and environmental data, can provide a more comprehensive monitoring of deep-sea biodiversity. Here, we describe the potential for acquiring eDNA as a core component for the expanding ecological monitoring capabilities through cabled observatories and their docked Internet Operated Vehicles (IOVs), such as crawlers.

Meadows of this endemic seagrass species represent the largest carbon storage among seagrasses around the world, largely contributing to global blue carbon stocks. Yet, the slow growth of this temperate species and the extreme projected temperature and sea-level rise due to climate change increase the risk of reduction and loss of these services. Currently, there are knowledge gaps in its basin-wide spatially explicit extent and relevant accounting, therefore accurate and efficient mapping of its distribution and trajectories of change is needed. Here, we leveraged contemporary advances in Earth Observation—cloud computing, open satellite data, and machine learning—with field observations through a cloud-native geoprocessing framework to account the spatially explicit ecosystem extent of P. oceanica seagrass across its full bioregional scale. Employing 279,186 Sentinel-2 satellite images between 2015 and 2019, and a human-labeled training dataset of 62,928 pixels, we mapped 19,020 km 2 of P. oceanica meadows up to 25 m of depth in 22 Mediterranean countries, across a total seabed area of 56,783 km 2 . Using 2,480 independent, field-based points, we observe an overall accuracy of 72%. We include and discuss global and region-specific seagrass blue carbon stocks using our bioregional seagrass extent estimate. As reference data collections, remote sensing technology and biophysical modelling improve and coalesce, such spatial ecosystem extent accounts could further support physical and monetary accounting of seagrass condition and ecosystem services, like blue carbon and coastal biodiversity. We envisage that effective policy uptake of these holistic seagrass accounts in national climate strategies and financing could accelerate transparent natural climate solutions and coastal resilience, far beyond the physical location of seagrass beds.","",https://doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2022.871799,"",,

The automation of taxonomic identification using CNNs leads naturally to the use of such technology for rapidly generating large organismal datasets in order to study the evolutionary and ecological dynamics of biological communities across time and space. While CNNs have been used to train machine learning classifiers that can identify organisms to the species level for several groups, this vision of automated community ecology has yet to be thoroughly tested or fulfilled. Here, we present a case study of automated community ecology using a large dataset of Atlantic planktonic foraminifera for which the generation of species labels and morphometric measurements was completely automated. We compare standard community diversity metrics between the fully automated dataset and a “traditional” dataset with human-identified specimens. We show that there is high congruence between the results, and that machine classifications help avoid biases that can result in the inference of misleading biodiversity patterns. Our study demonstrates the viability and potential of fully automated community ecology and sets the stage for a new era of ecological and evolutionary inquiry driven by artificial intelligence.","",https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.10.31.514514,"",,

Natural history collections are increasingly important for such research and can provide ecological information across broad spatial and temporal scales. Here, we describe novel approaches that integrate museum specimens from insect and plant collections with field observations to quantify pollen networks over large spatial and temporal gradients. We present methodological strategies for evaluating insect-pollen network parameters based on pollen collected from museum insect specimens. These methods provide insight into spatial and temporal variation in pollen-insect interactions and complement other approaches to studying pollination, such as pollinator observation networks and flower enclosure experiments. We present example data from butterfly pollen networks over the past century in the Great Basin Desert and Sierra Nevada Mountains, United States. Complementary to these approaches, we describe rapid pollen identification methods that can increase speed and accuracy of taxonomic determinations, using pollen grains collected from herbarium specimens. As an example, we describe a convolutional neural network (CNN) to automate identification of pollen. We extracted images of pollen grains from 21 common species from herbarium specimens at the University of Nevada Reno (RENO). The CNN model achieved exceptional accuracy of identification, with a correct classification rate of 98.8%. These and similar approaches can transform the way we estimate pollination network parameters and greatly change inferences from existing networks, which have exploded over the past few decades. These techniques also allow us to address critical ecological questions related to mutualistic networks, community ecology, and conservation biology.

These systems occur at fine scales, can be highly complex and therefore offer the opportunity to test mechanisms of ecological patterns and processes. The capacity to confidently characterize urban gardens and their land uses is still lacking, while it could provide the basis for assessing ecosystem service provision. Land classifications from remote sensing platforms are common at the landscape scale, but imagery often lacks the resolution required to map differences in land use of fine-scale systems such as urban gardens. Here, we present a workflow to model and map land use in urban gardens using imagery from an unoccupied aerial vehicle (UAV) and machine learning. Due to high resolutions (&amp;lt;5 cm) from image acquisition at low altitudes, UAV remote sensing is better suited to characterize urban land use. We mapped six common land uses in 10 urban community gardens, exhibiting distinct spatial arrangements. Our models had good predictive performance, reaching 80% overall prediction accuracy in independent validation and up to 95% when assessing model performance per cover class. Extracting spatial metrics from these land use classifications, we found that at the garden and plot scale, plant species richness can be estimated by the total area and patchiness of crops. Land use classifications like these can offer an accessible tool to assess complex urban habitats and justify the importance of urban agriculture as a service-providing system, contributing to the sustainability and livability of cities.","",https://doi.org/10.1093/jue/juac008,"",,

Coastal ecosystem rehabilitation is particularly important, as these ecosystems sequester large quantities of carbon (known in marine ecosystems as “blue carbon”) thereby mitigating climate change effects while also providing ecosystem services and biodiversity benefits. The recent formal accreditation of blue carbon services is producing a proliferation of rehabilitation projects, which must be monitored and quantified over time and space to assess on-ground outcomes. Consequently, remote sensing techniques such as drone surveys, and machine learning techniques such as image classification, are increasingly being employed to monitor wetlands. However, few projects, if any, have tracked blue carbon restoration across temporal and spatial scales at an accuracy that could be used to adequately map species establishment with low-cost methods. This study presents an open-source, user-friendly workflow, using object-based image classification and a random forest classifier in Google Earth Engine, to accurately classify 4 years of multispectral and photogrammetrically derived digital elevation model drone data at a saltmarsh rehabilitation site on the east coast of Australia (Hunter River estuary, NSW). High classification accuracies were achieved, with &amp;gt;90% accuracy at 0.1 m resolution. At the study site, saltmarsh colonised most suitable areas, increasing by 142% and resulting in 56 tonnes of carbon sequestered, within a 4-year period, providing insight into blue carbon regeneration trajectories. Saltmarsh growth patterns were species-specific, influenced by species’ reproductive and dispersal strategies. Our findings suggested that biotic factors and interactions were important in influencing species’ distributions and succession trajectories. This work can help improve the efficiency and effectiveness of restoration planning and monitoring at coastal wetlands and similar ecosystems worldwide, with the potential to apply this approach to other types of remote sensing imagery and to calculate other rehabilitation co-benefits. Importantly, the method can be used to calculate blue carbon habitat creation following tidal restoration of coastal wetlands.","",https://doi.org/10.3389/fenvs.2022.924221,"",,

Nevertheless, many monitoring programs may seek to transition to alternative methods because emerging technologies can improve trend tracking and expand the number of target populations, increase spatial scale, and reduce long-term costs. Integrated models strengthen the capacity to adapt long-term monitoring programs to next generation methods. Here we present a case study of northern spotted owl ( Strix occidentalis caurina ) population monitoring that is under transition. The first monitoring phase focused on territory occupancy and mark-resighting individual owls. Owing to rapidly declining populations and increasing costs, traditional methods are less viable for long-term monitoring. A non-invasive approach, passive acoustic monitoring, is effective for detecting spotted owl presence, estimating occupancy rates, distinguishing sex, detecting trends in populations, and monitoring many additional species. A key component to support transition to passive acoustic monitoring was the development of machine learning models to automate species detections that enable rapid and effective data processing and analysis workflows. Coupling passive acoustic monitoring networks with Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) and gradient nearest neighbor (GNN) datasets provide powerful tools for predicting forest change impacts on wildlife populations and identify winners and losers in dynamic landscapes. The second monitoring phase will leverage new technologies, expand the scope of inference, link forest inventory and remote sensing datasets, and transition the program to broad biodiversity monitoring that assists managers as they face myriad challenges in dynamic landscapes.","",https://doi.org/10.3389/ffgc.2022.966978,"",,

Moose (Alces alces) in Northeast China is on the southernmost edge of the geographical range of Eurasian moose, the distribution of this population is retreating, and population number has been declining for the last several decades. However, little is known about its habitat suitability over a large spatial scale, which hinders further effective conservation of the moose in China. It is critical to explore the moose-habitat relationships and habitat suitability to understand moose habitat requirements, potential land use impacts, and effective management. In this paper, we combined remote sensing-derived predictors and machine learning methods (down-sampling random forests) to explore the moose-habitat associations and map moose habitat suitability. Results showed that our model performed well to excellently in terms of three evaluation metrics (AUCROC, AUCPR, CBI), which indicates the advantages of the combination of remote sensing and machine learning methods in predicting moose habitat. We identified the main factors driving moose distribution in Northeast China are the human footprint index, the mean monthly maximum temperature of the late spring, the percentage of coniferous forest, the minimum dynamic habitat index, the minimum temperature of the coldest month, and the distance from town. Moose responds to these variables nonlinearly. Generally, variables related to human disturbance and heat stress are the main drivers of moose occurrence and are negatively associated with moose occurrence probability. High suitability areas are mainly distributed in eastern and northern Greater Khingan Mountains. Highly suitable habitat covers only a small proportion of the study area.

The distribution and abundance of shorebirds will strongly depend on their prey and on landscape and sediment features such as mud and surface water content, topography, and the presence of ecosystem engineers. An understanding of shorebird distribution and ecology thus requires knowledge of the various habitat types which may be distinguished in intertidal areas. Here, we combine Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 imagery and a digital elevation model (DEM), using machine learning techniques to map intertidal habitat types of importance to migratory shorebirds and their benthic prey. We do this on the third most important non-breeding area for migratory shorebirds in the East Atlantic Flyway, in the Bijagós Archipelago in West Africa. Using pixel-level random forests, we successfully mapped rocks, shell beds, and macroalgae and distinguished between areas of bare sediment and areas occupied by fiddler crabs, an ecosystem engineer that promotes significant bioturbation on intertidal flats. We also classified two sediment types (sandy and mixed) within the bare sediment and fiddler crab areas, according to their mud content. The overall classification accuracy was 82%, and the Kappa Coefficient was 73%. The most important predictors were elevation, the Sentinel-2-derived water and moisture indexes, and Sentinel-1 VH band. The association of Sentinel-2 with Sentinel-1 and a DEM produced the best results compared to the models without these variables. This map provides an overall picture of the composition of the intertidal habitats in a site of international importance for migratory shorebirds. Most of the intertidal flats of the Bijagós Archipelago are covered by bare sandy sediments (59%), and ca. 22% is occupied by fiddler crabs. This likely has significant implications for the spatial arrangement of the shorebird and benthic invertebrate communities due to the ecosystem engineering by the fiddler crabs, which promotes two vastly different intertidal species assemblages. This large-scale mapping provides an important product for the future monitoring of this high biodiversity area, particularly for ecological research related to the distribution and feeding ecology of the shorebirds and their prey. Such information is key from a conservation and management perspective. By delivering a successful and comprehensive mapping workflow, we contribute to the filling of the current knowledge gap on the application of remote sensing and machine learning techniques within intertidal areas, which are among the most challenging environments to map using remote sensing techniques.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/rs14143260,"",,

Recent technological advancements offer potential solutions to achieve this through: (i) increasingly affordable high throughput recording hardware, which can collect rich multidimensional data, and (ii) increasingly accessible artificial intelligence approaches, which are able to extract ecological knowledge from large datasets. However, automating the monitoring of facets of ecological populations and communities via such technologies is still in its infancy, being primarily achieved at low spatiotemporal resolutions within specific stages of the monitoring workflow. Here, we review existing technologies for data recording and processing that enable automated monitoring of ecological communities. We then present novel frameworks that combine such technologies, forming fully automated pipelines to detect, track, classify, and count multiple species, and even record behavioural and morphological traits, at resolutions which have previously been impossible to achieve.

Here, we used machine learning (random forests, extreme gradient boosting, neural networks) and conventional statistical methods (generalised linear models, generalised additive models) to model species richness and phylogenetic richness of vascular plants worldwide based on 830 regional plant inventories including c. 300,000 species and predictors of past and present environmental conditions. Machine learning showed an outstanding performance, explaining up to 80.9% of species richness and 83.3% of phylogenetic richness. Current climate and environmental heterogeneity emerged as the primary drivers, while past environmental conditions left only small but detectable imprints on plant diversity. Finally, we combined predictions from multiple modelling techniques (ensemble predictions) to reveal global patterns and centres of plant diversity at multiple resolutions down to 7,774 km 2 . Our predictive maps provide the most accurate estimates of global plant diversity available to date at grain sizes relevant for conservation and macroecology.","",https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.04.08.487610,"",,
rayyan-210753879,How Do Taxonomic and Functional Diversity Metrics Change Along an Aridity Gradient in a Tropical Dry Forest?,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Ecological indicators based on biodiversity metrics are valuable and cost-effective tools to quantify, track and understand the effects of climate change on ecosystems. Studying changes in these indicators along climatic gradients in space is a common approach to infer about potential impacts of climate change over time, overcoming the limitations of lack of sufficiently long time-series data. Here, we studied the response of complementary biodiversity metrics in plants: taxonomic diversity (species richness and Simpson index) and functional diversity (diversity and redundancy) in 113 sampling sites along a spatial aridity gradient (from 0.27 to 0.69 of aridity index-AI) of 700 km in a Tropical dry forest. We found different responses of taxonomic and functional diversity metrics to aridity. Species diversity showed a hump-shaped curve peaking at intermediate levels of aridity between 0.38 and 0.52 AI as an ecotone, probably because it is where most species, from both drier and more mesic environments, still find conditions to co-exist. Functional diversity showed a positive linear relation with increasing aridity, suggesting higher aridity favors drought-adapted species with diverse functional traits. In contrast, redundancy showed a negative linear relation with increasing aridity, indicating that drier sites have few species sharing the same functional traits and resource acquisition strategies. Thus, despite the increase in functional diversity toward drier sites, these communities are less resilient since they are composed of a small number of plant species with unique functions, increasing the chances that the loss of one of such ""key species"" could lead to the loss of key ecosystem functions. These findings show that the integration of complementary taxonomic and functional diversity metrics, beyond the individual response of each one, is essential for reliably tracking the impacts of climate change on ecosystems. This work also provides support to the use of these biodiversity metrics as ecological indicators of the potential impact of climate change on drylands over time.","",https://doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2022.923219,"",,
rayyan-210753997,Machine learning model ensemble based on multi-scale predictors confirms ecological segregation and accurately predicts the occurrence of net-spinning caddisfly larvae species groups (Trichoptera: Hydropsychidae) at catchment-scale,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"In riverine ecosystems the species distribution, determined primarily by their environment often shows zonation patterns that are also typical in the case of net-spinning caddisfly larvae (Trichoptera: Hydropsychidae). In the present research, we aimed to build an ensemble of base learner machine learning (ML) models based on the most important environmental parameters shaping the sequential distribution of ten Central European species of the genus Hydropsyche in the North Hungarian catchment area of Tisza, one of the major rivers of Central and Eastern Europe. The model could explain and effectively predict the occurrence of species and/or groups of them with similar niche preferences. Variable selection revealed the importance of predictors, measured at various spatial scales and with gradient-like characteristics, such as elevation, annual means of discharge, water temperature or the composition of habitat substrates as well as those related to the ecological quality of water or anthropogenic impacts, like annual means of dissolved oxygen and orthophosphate-phosphorous content. Trained on the predictions of different base learner models a final ensemble model predicted the presence and absence of three individual species and three species-groups with significantly improved overall accuracy. High group-wise balanced accuracies of the final model shows that longitudinal, catchment-scale distribution models in stream ecosystems are best built on predictors with variable spatial scales, several of which are routinely measured or recorded in environmental monitoring programmes. Accurate species distribution models (SDMs), capable of adequately predicting presence and absence of bio-indicator taxa, such as Hydropsyche species, can be applied to support environmental management or conservation measures regarding streams and rivers, that are among the most vulnerable of anthropogenic pollution, hydrologic alteration, climate change and biodiversity loss.","",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2022.109769,"",,

Restoring these forests is essential to help avoid the worst impacts of climate change. Yet monitoring tropical forest recovery is challenging. We track the abundance of early-successional species in a forest restoration concession in Indonesia. If the species are carefully chosen, they can be used as an indicator of restoration progress. We present SLIC-UAV, a new pipeline for processing Unoccupied Aerial Vehicle (UAV) imagery using simple linear iterative clustering (SLIC)to map early-successional species in tropical forests. The pipeline comprises: (a) a field verified approach for manually labeling species; (b) automatic segmentation of imagery into “superpixels” and (c) machine learning classification of species based on both spectral and textural features. Creating superpixels massively reduces the dataset's dimensionality and enables the use of textural features, which improve classification accuracy. In addition, this approach is flexible with regards to the spatial distribution of training data. This allowed us to be flexible in the field and collect high-quality training data with the help of local experts. The accuracy ranged from 74.3% for a four-species classification task to 91.7% when focusing only on the key early-succesional species. We then extended these models across 100 hectares of forest, mapping species dominance and forest condition across the entire restoration project.","",https://doi.org/10.3389/ffgc.2022.876448,"",,
rayyan-210754007,Evidence‐based guidelines for automated conservation assessments of plant species,,1,1,,,,,,,,es,,,"Assessing species' extinction risk is vital to setting conservation priorities. However, assessment endeavors, such as those used to produce the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, have significant gaps in taxonomic coverage. Automated assessment (AA) methods are gaining popularity to fill these gaps. Choices made in developing, using, and reporting results of AA methods could hinder their successful adoption or lead to poor allocation of conservation resources. We explored how choice of data cleaning type and level, taxonomic group, training sample, and automation method affect performance of threat status predictions for plant species. We used occurrences from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) to generate assessments for species in 3 taxonomic groups based on 6 different occurrence-based AA methods. We measured each method's performance and coverage following increasingly stringent occurrence cleaning. Automatically cleaned data from GBIF performed comparably to occurrence records cleaned manually by experts. However, all types of data cleaning limited the coverage of AAs. Overall, machine-learning-based methods performed well across taxa, even with minimal data cleaning. Results suggest a machine-learning-based method applied to minimally cleaned data offers the best compromise between performance and species coverage. However, optimal data cleaning, training sample, and automation methods depend on the study group, intended applications, and expertise.La valoración del riesgo de extinción de las especies es vital para el establecimiento de prioridades de conservación. Sin embargo, los esfuerzos de valoración, como los que se usan para generar la Lista Roja de Especies Amenazadas de la UICN, tienen brechas importantes en la cobertura taxonómica. Los métodos de valoración automatizada (VA) están ganando popularidad como reductores de estas brechas. Las elecciones realizadas en el desarrollo, uso y reporte de resultados de los métodos de VA podrían obstaculizar su adopción exitosa o derivar en una asignación deficiente de recursos para la conservación. Exploramos cómo la selección del tipo de limpieza de datos y el nivel, grupo taxonómico, muestra de entrenamiento y el método de automatización afectan el desempeño de las predicciones del estado de amenaza de las especies de plantas. Usamos los registros de la Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) para generar las valoraciones de las especies de tres grupos taxonómicos con base en seis métodos diferentes de VA basados en la presencia de las especies. Medimos el desempeño de cada método y cobertura después de una limpieza de presencia cada vez más estricta. La información de la GBIF limpiada automáticamente tuvo un desempeño comparable con los registros de presencia limpiados manualmente por expertos. Sin embargo, todos los tipos de limpieza de datos limitaron la cobertura de las valoraciones automatizadas. En general, los métodos basados en el aprendizaje automático tuvieron un buen desempeño en todos los taxones, incluso con una limpieza mínima de datos. Los resultados sugieren que un método basado en el aprendizaje automático aplicado a información con la mínima limpieza ofrece el mejor equilibrio entre el desempeño y la cobertura de la especie. A pesar de esto, la limpieza óptima de datos, la muestra de entrenamiento y los métodos de automatización dependen del grupo de estudio, las aplicaciones deseadas y la experiencia.","",https://doi.org/10.1111/cobi.13992,"",,
rayyan-210754126,Is there an accurate and generalisable way to use soundscapes to monitor biodiversity?,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract Acoustic monitoring has the potential to deliver biodiversity insight on vast scales. Whilst autonomous recording networks are being deployed across the world, existing analytical techniques struggle with generalisability. This limits the insight that can be derived from audio recordings in regions without ground-truth calibration data. By calculating 128 learned features and 60 soundscape indices of audio recorded during 8,023 avifaunal point counts from diverse ecosystems, we investigated the generalisability of soundscape approaches to biodiversity monitoring. Within each dataset, we found univariate correlations between several acoustic features and avian species richness, but features behaved unpredictably across datasets. Training a machine learning model on compound indices, we could predict species richness within datasets. However, models were uninformative when applied to datasets not used for training. We found that changes in soundscape features were correlated with changes in avian communities across all datasets. However, there were cases where avian communities changed without an associated shift in soundscapes. Our results suggest that there are no common hallmarks of biodiverse soundscapes across ecosystems. Therefore, soundscape monitoring should only be used when high quality ground-truth data exists for the region of interest, and in conjunction with more targeted and accurate in-person ecological surveys. By better understanding how to use interpret data reliably, we hope to unlock the scale at which acoustic monitoring can be used to deliver true impact for land managers and scientists monitoring biodiversity around the world. Summary Whilst eco-acoustic monitoring has the potential to deliver biodiversity insight on vast scales, existing analytical approaches behave unpredictably across studies. We collated 8,023 audio recordings with paired manual avifaunal point counts to investigate whether soundscapes could be used to monitor biodiversity across diverse ecosystems. We found that neither univariate indices nor machine learning models were predictive of species richness across datasets, but soundscape change was consistently indicative of community change. Our findings indicate that there are no common features of biodiverse soundscapes, and that soundscape monitoring should be used cautiously and in conjunction with more reliable in-person ecological surveys.","",https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.12.19.521085,"",,
rayyan-210754202,"The Marine Biodiversity Observation Network Plankton Workshops: Plankton Ecosystem Function, Biodiversity, and Forecasting—Research Requirements and Applications",,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Plankton is a massive and phylogenetically diverse group of thousands of prokaryotes, protists (unicellular eukaryotic organisms), and metazoans (multicellular eukaryotic organisms; Fig. 1). Plankton functional diversity is at the core of various ecological processes, including productivity, carbon cycling and sequestration, nutrient cycling (Falkowski 2012), interspecies interactions, and food web dynamics and structure (D'Alelio et al. 2016). Through these functions, plankton play a critical role in the health of the coastal and open ocean and provide essential ecosystem services. Yet, at present, our understanding of plankton dynamics is insufficient to project how climate change and other human-driven impacts affect the functional diversity of plankton. That limits our ability to predict how critical ecosystem services will change in the future and develop strategies to adapt to these changes. The Marine Biodiversity Observation Network (MBON; https://geobon.org/bons/thematic-bon/mbon/, last accessed date: 22 Dec 2021), with the support of the Modelling Different Components of Marine Plankton Biodiversity team (MODIV; https://modiv.w.uib.no/, last accessed date: 22 Dec 2021), organized four virtual workshops (first in November 2020, second and third in October 2021, and fourth in November 2021) titled: “Plankton ecosystem functions, biodiversity, and forecasting—research requirements and applications” (https://eqmh.github.io/MBON-Plankton/index.html, last accessed date: 22 Dec 2021). The first workshop held in November 2020 was an initiative of the US-MBON and MODIV teams to bring together members of the ocean sciences community involved in plankton observing and modeling to meet, build rapport, and exchange expertise. The following workshops were organized to accommodate time differences: one for South, Central, and North America in October 2021; one for Africa, Europe, the Middle East, and India in October 2021; and one for East Asia and Oceania in November 2021. Each workshop was held for two consecutive days, and participation was limited to 20–25 participants per workshop to enable interactive discussions. In total, 80 participants from 26 countries attended at least one of the workshops (Fig. 2). A detailed list of participants can be found in the workshops' website (https://eqmh.github.io/MBON-Plankton/participants.html, last accessed date: 22 Dec 2021). The United States of America and Australia were the countries with the most participants, followed by Canada, Germany, China, the United Kingdom, and Argentina. The objectives of the workshops were to: (1) identify requirements with respect to the definition of essential ocean variables (EOVs) and associated measurements, as well as compile the data needed to address critical knowledge gaps related to the role of plankton biodiversity functions to provide ecosystem services; (2) discuss ways to better link empirical observations to theoretical concepts of plankton biodiversity and ecosystem dynamics; and (3) suggest methods to better communicate the value of plankton to peers and non-scientific audiences. Participants discussed possible actions to overcome these challenges and limitations. There was agreement that observations in natural ocean habitats are fundamental to the formulation and testing of new hypotheses and conceptual models. More active communication between data providers and users will benefit the data collection, interpretation and analysis, and usability. For example, data that allow quantifying relationships among species traits (e.g., size, stoichiometry) will help inform understanding of species responses to environmental conditions. Although participants agreed that there is a lack of standardization of methods, data formatting, and distribution methods, in addition to a paucity of information on data quality and uncertainty, they also recognized the challenges of establishing a global protocol for field practices considering the regional environmental differences. For example, a net with a smaller mesh size is needed in tropical regions because plankton body size generally declines with warming (Campbell et al. 2021), in contrast a net with a larger mesh size which is towed faster is needed if the target is euphausiids rather than copepods. As a solution, participants suggested the use, further expansion, and explanation of existing protocols as best practices, and the set of minimum data and measurements required for data synthesis be laid out. Additionally, the creation of a community-driven unit conversion policy will help to normalize datasets and allow for a better understanding of variability and uncertainty. These approaches can help develop and validate models and minimize the uncertainty in data-driven meta-analysis studies. It was also agreed that, as a community, we need to build capacity at three levels: taxonomic ability, data science, and data management. We need to highlight the fundamental role of taxonomists in providing high-quality data, and of data scientists for data-driven meta-analysis and synthesis. Databases should follow Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reuse principles, to credit and recognize the original data providers. Sufficient funds for the curation and archiving of project data should be included in future funding proposals at the national and international levels. Participants identified the ideal scenario for data users is interlinked data repositories, standardized conversion tables, interoperable data collection protocols, and documented uncertainty levels. Each is a rather challenging task. As a first step, participants recommend an inventory of plankton databases with a summary of their holdings such as the geographic area covered, time covered, types of plankton data included, and information on data format and access (e.g., GOOS Biology and Ecosystems Panel, https://www.goosocean.org/index.php?option=com_oe&task=viewGroupRecord&groupID=339, last accessed date: 28 Jan 2022). The value of plankton is mainly invisible and difficult to quantify, mostly because the public is aware of the ultimate ecosystem service delivered, but not the underlying ecosystem functions of organisms that deliver that service (e.g., the connection of plankton to fish and fisheries). That is, plankton are valuable through their provisioning of ecological and biogeochemical services that enhance the cultural and economic value of the marine environment. They are responsible for approximately half of the Earth's oxygen production and photosynthetic carbon fixation (Field et al. 1998), and play the fundamental “bio” role in biogeochemical cycling of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and many other elements. They are linked through the food web to higher trophic levels and generate economic and recreational benefits for humans. Plankton are involved in feedback processes that affect the evolution and survival of all marine species (Falkowski 2012), and promote marine biodiversity such as fish, benthic organisms, marine and even terrestrial birds, and mammals. Many participants highlighted that although public awareness of the value of the services provided by plankton are often unrecognized, plankton is usually known for negative reasons, such as blooms of pathogenic bacteria, harmful algae, or jellyfish. The value of plankton to policy makers and the public can be highlighted by quantifying in economic terms and illustrating the link between plankton biodiversity and things we value (e.g., iconic species, recreational activities, water quality, carbon storage, nature conservation). Citizen science, education, science-art projects, and outreach activities are important ways to raise this awareness. There are many plankton-related outreach activities for all ages, but as outreach is commonly the least-funded component of scientific projects, it is imperative that we find ways to advance them. Models, virtual reality, and artificial intelligence could also be further developed as heuristic educational tools. One way to improve awareness is to integrate social scientists and those involved with science advice and policy into the development of research grants, approach mass media communication, and also consider opportunities presented by the Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development (2021–2030) as proclaimed by the United Nations (https://en.unesco.org/ocean-decade, last accessed date: 22 Dec 2021).

These methods are powerful because they can rapidly and automatically extract rich contextual and spatial information from images, a process that has historically required a large amount of manual labor. The potential of image-based machine learning methods to change how researchers study the ocean has been demonstrated through a diverse range of recent applications. However, despite their promise, machine learning tools are still under-exploited in many domains including species and environmental monitoring, biodiversity surveys, fisheries abundance and size estimation, rare event and species detection, the study of wild animal behavior, and citizen science. Our objective in this article is to provide an approachable, application-oriented guide to help researchers apply image-based machine learning methods effectively to their own research problems. Using a case study, we describe how to prepare data, train and deploy models, and avoid common pitfalls that can cause models to underperform. Importantly, we discuss how to diagnose problems that can cause poor model performance on new imagery to build robust tools that can vastly accelerate data acquisition in the marine realm.

The rapidly decreasing cost of DNA sequencing now enables unprecedented insights into biological diversity, species and ecosystem conservation, human and animal health, agriculture, food production, and biotechnology. However, environmental degradation and anthropogenic decimation of natural populations increasingly make biological collection more costly and less environmentally acceptable. Changing environmental regulations and complex permitting processes also complicate collecting practices and add to their cost. As a result, the rising cost and difficulty of sampling now frequently exceed sequencing costs as obstacles to biological research.These considerations are particularly important for marine environments. The World Register of Marine Species1 names >239,000 accepted marine species, however, estimates suggest that >90% of the ocean's species remain unnamed, undiscovered, undescribed, and poorly understood.2 Although the ocean contains fewer named species than terrestrial environments, its deep phylogenetic biodiversity is evident at higher taxonomic levels where much of the fundamental biochemical diversity of life is found.For example, two-thirds of all animal phyla are mainly or exclusively marine, whereas only about a quarter are commonly represented on land. Only one animal phylum has no known marine representatives. Thus, to fully understand the diversity of life, the vast biodiversity of marine life must be addressed. The marine realm is also substantially larger in area and volume than the terrestrial world and is often more difficult and dangerous to access. Marine sampling requires specialized knowledge, skills, and equipment, and often poses significant health risks to collectors.The Ocean Genome Legacy Center (OGL) of Northeastern University was created to address these issues. OGL is a nonprofit open-access marine biorepository and research laboratory dedicated to collecting, preserving, and sharing genomic resources—primarily preserved DNA and tissue samples—from diverse marine taxa. OGL's mission is to acquire, authenticate, study, preserve, develop, and distribute marine genomic materials, biological specimens, information, technology, and standards needed to advance basic and applied research.OGL operates under policies that ensure legal, equitable, and ethical use of genomic resources in compliance with existing laws and the principles established by the Nagoya Protocol (https://www.cbd.int/abs/). OGL operates as a collaborative research collection and welcomes sample contributions and requests from individuals and institutions. Its primary goal is to accelerate research that can protect marine ecosystems and improve the human condition by (a) facilitating open sample sharing, (b) enabling easy access to rare and hard-to-find materials, (c) allowing multiple uses of collected materials, (d) mitigating the costs and hazards of marine sampling, (e) reducing the need for destructive sampling in sensitive environments, and (f) facilitating dissemination of contextual, taxonomic, and biogeographic data.OGL's collection (Fig. 1) is located at Northeastern University's Marine Science Center in Nahant, MA, in a secure cryostorage facility that includes mechanical (−80°C) and liquid nitrogen (−186°C) freezer units with backup power, controlled entry, and temperature surveillance provided around-the-clock, monitored both by security personnel and electronic security systems.FIG. 1.

Color images are available online.OGL's collection policy may be viewed at https://bit.ly/OGLCollectionPolicy. In brief, OGL accepts legally collected biological materials from all marine taxa. Samples are vetted for provenance and permits, and taxonomic names are verified against the World Register of Marine Species (www.marinespecies.org).3 Physical voucher materials are held at OGL or other public collections, with appropriate accession numbers provided upon submission. Digital vouchers may include photo, video, audio, and/or diagnostic molecular sequence files. OGL operates in compliance with best practices established by the International Society for Biological and Environmental Repositories (www.isber.org).4Taxonomic, contextual, collection, storage, and biogeographic data, as well as associated documents and permits are maintained in a database using Darwin Core controlled vocabulary.5 OGL is a core member of the Global Genome Biodiversity Network (www.ggbn.org)6 and shares biogeographic occurrence data through the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (www.gbif.org) and the Ocean Biodiversity Information System (www.obis.org). There is no charge for samples deposited to or received from the OGL collection, however, modest cost recovery fees are typically charged for sample requests to cover sample processing, shipping, handling, and any additional services requested.Materials are distributed under Material Transfer Agreements (https://bit.ly/OGLDistributionMTA), which govern their noncommercial use. Commercial use requires appropriate licensing agreements formed directly with the nations, depositors, and other stakeholders owning rights to those materials. OGL is not typically a party to such licensing agreements and claims no commercial rights to materials deposited to its collections.Instructions for sample deposits and requests may be found at https://bit.ly/OGLDepositSamples and https://bit.ly/OGLRequestSamples. OGL facilitates sample deposit by providing depositor kits that contain labeled tubes, appropriate preservatives, and an electronic spreadsheet for data deposition. Upon receipt of biological materials, DNA is extracted and purified according to taxon- and tissue-specific protocols. Extracted DNA and residual tissues are preserved at ultralow temperatures (−80°C to −186°C) to ensure their long-term viability. Quality control checks are performed as needed by gel electrophoresis, spectrophotometry, and other appropriate methods.In addition to preservation and distribution of biological materials, OGL offers consultation, assistance in locating and procuring materials not held in the OGL collection, and DNA barcoding for species identification. Examples of OGL use cases include the following: 1.Storage, documentation, and sharing of biological materials for researchers and institutions.2.Collection planning for retirement: OGL works with researchers to ensure proper documentation, preservation, and secure maintenance of their collections beyond retirement. Past retirement rescues have included valuable collections of Antarctic fishes, deep-sea hydrothermal vent and cold seep invertebrates, and polyclad flatworms.3.Specimen and permit management for common, rare, and endangered species: OGL facilitates sample storage, import, export, and compliance with CITES, Marine Mammal Protection Act, and Endangered Species Act.4.Specimens for medical research: OGL samples have been used for discovery of antibiotic7,8 and antiparasitic9 drug lead candidates.5.Research consultation: OGL provided taxonomic guidance and >500 marine fish samples for a survey of DNA methylation across the animal kingdom.6.Species identification: OGL performed DNA barcode analysis on 286 supermarket fish samples for the New York Attorney General's office10 and routinely identifies marine samples for government and commercial entities, researchers, and private citizens.For more information, please see https://ogl.northeastern.edu/ or contact OGL at oglinfo@northeastern.edu.Authors' ContributionsAll persons who meet authorship criteria are listed as authors, and all authors certify that they have participated sufficiently in the study to take public responsibility for the content, including participation in the concept, design, analysis, writing, or revision of the article.AcknowledgmentsWe dedicate this article to the memory of OGL founder Dr. Donald G.

rayyan-210754371,When Specimens Become Environmental Traits: Automating data extraction in aerobiology,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"The identity of a biological specimen can be considered the most basic type of trait: the species (or higher taxon) the specimen belongs to, one of the three most fundamental data elements (along with location and time) that configure the primary biodiversity data record whose quantification may underpin biological monitoring programs. A general image containing specimens (for example, a photo from a surveillance camera), where individual organisms are to be identified, is akin to an image of a single organism where traits are to be recognized: the individual, often distinct organisms in the image, become the traits of the image. In many cases, automated segmentation and classification/identification and counting of individuals captured within general images containing multiple organisms is most desirable—provided precision and recall exceed a reasonable threshold: that which minimizes the false-positive error rate, as compared to human identification in images. When this occurs, quantitative monitoring data are amenable to good automation, saving much time and human effort. One particularly well-suited case is that of airborne pollen and spore monitoring, hitherto done manually in most of the world. However, systems are being developed that can recognize atmospheric pollen content from images. Two main approaches are possible: either fully automated systems, or recognition from captured field images. In both cases, some instance of artificial intelligence, most often a convolutional neural network, is tasked with the recognition of pollen and spore types, after proper training, from microscopic images. Several problems exist for the wider adoption of such approaches. Among them, the workflow order of segmentation and identification, the portability of the neural network training for different locations, the differences in performance for distinct particle types, and the generation and archival of images: field images vs. individual (segmented) detected specimens, which call for wholly different approaches to metadata. In this presentation we review the general outlook of automated airborne pollen and spore monitoring data, and compare performance data in some specific deep learning settings and workflows, based on actual monitoring work, training and tests with real images.","",https://doi.org/10.3897/biss.6.94914,"",,
rayyan-210754441,Benchmarking Invasive Alien Species Image Recognition Models for a Citizen Science Based Spatial Distribution Monitoring,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract. Recent developments in image recognition technology including artificial intelligence and machine learning led to an intensified research in computer vision models. This progress also allows advances for the collection of spatio-temporal data on Invasive Alien Species (IAS), in order to understand their geographical distribution and impact on the biodiversity loss. Citizen Science (CS) approaches already show successful solutions how the public can be involved in collecting spatio-temporal data on IAS, e.g. by using mobile applications for monitoring. Our work analyzes recently developed image-based species recognition models suitable for the monitoring of IAS in CS applications. We demonstrate how computer vision models can be benchmarked for such a use case and how their accuracy can be evaluated by testing them with IAS of European Union concern. We found out that available models have different strengths. Depending on which criteria (e.g. high species coverage, costs, maintenance, high accuracies) are considered as most important, it needs to be decided individually which model fits best. Using only one model alone may not necessarily be the best solution, thus combining multiple models or developing a new custom model can be desirable. Generally, cooperation with the model providers can be advantageous.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/agile-giss-3-10-2022,"",,

rayyan-210754495,Adaptive Representations of Sound for Automatic Insect Recognition,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Insects are an integral part of our ecosystem. These often small and evasive animals have a big impact on their surroundings, providing a large part of the present biodiversity and pollination duties, forming the foundation of the food chain and many biological and ecological processes. Due to factors of human influence, population numbers and biodiversity have been rapidly declining with time. Monitoring this decline has become increasingly important for conservation measures to be effectively implemented. But monitoring methods are often invasive, time and resource intense, and prone to various biases. Many insect species produce characteristic mating sounds that can easily be detected and recorded without large cost or effort. Using deep learning methods, insect sounds from field recordings could be automatically detected and classified to monitor biodiversity and species distribution ranges. In this project, I implement this using existing datasets of insect sounds (Orthoptera and Cicadidae) and machine learning methods and evaluate their potential for acoustic insect monitoring. I compare the performance of the conventional spectrogram-based deep learning method against the new adaptive and waveform-based approach LEAF. The waveform-based frontend achieved significantly better classification performance than the Mel-spectrogram frontend by adapting its feature extraction parameters during training. This result is encouraging for future implementations of deep learning technology for automatic insect sound recognition, especially if larger datasets become available.","",https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2211.09503,"",,
rayyan-210754503,TreeSp2Vec: a method for developing tree species embeddings using deep neural networks,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract 1. In recent years, Representation Learning (RL), a subdiscipline of artificial intelligence, has proved a valuable resource in many research fields for mapping abstract categories into numeric scales as a means to boost varied quantitative modeling tasks. Despite the up-and-coming advantages that RL could imply for managing categorical data in ecological modeling, applications in ecology are still lacking. In this study, we proposed a new method for applying RL to forest ecology, labeled TreeSp2Vec, for developing tree species numeric representations (embeddings).2. Our approach entailed a supervised species classification of individual trees using as input a set of phytocentric (morphometrics and composition) and geocentric (climate, soil, and physiography) variables derived from National Forest Inventory data and environmental cartography. Species classification was carried out using deep neural networks with several fully connected layers, an intermediate embedding layer of up to 32 dimensions, and an output layer with softmax activations.3. Among the tested neural network architectures, a multi-layer perceptron with two hidden layers of 1024 units and an embedding layer of 16 units provided the best apparent and test classification performances (Matthew’s Correlation Coefficient = 0.89). Additionally, the developed latent representations (W), or embeddings, were evaluated intrinsically by estimating their correlations with supplementary species descriptors that were not included in the training dataset. The evaluation analysis revealed some significant associations that proved the generality of the embedding model. For instance, some latent dimensions (e.g., W6 and W16) helped differentiate species general features, such as conifers vs. broad-leaved species, while other dimensions (e.g., W2 and W5) were related to forest ecosystem characteristics such as competition intensity (relative spacing index) and biodiversity (Simpson index).4. We concluded that the developed embeddings provided accurate and generalizable numeric representations of the considered tree species, which can be used as a ground for further cutting-edge forest ecology modeling approaches. Moreover, our approach is easily extendable to other ecological research areas, opening a new range of artificial intelligence applications in ecology.","",https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-957638/v4,"",,

Soil degradation, extreme drought and flooding events, shifting climatic patterns and other challenges have prompted many disciplines within plant science to pivot to find solutions. Accordingly, root research has expanded from fundamental studies on roots, as providers of physical support, water and essential nutrients uptake, towards identification of beneficial traits for stress adaptation and control of key biological soil processes. Advances in trait identification, data acquisition, management and modelling are enabling root researchers to develop predictive models to support ecosystems in these changing environments. Through technical presentations, posters, industry exhibits and a root phenotyping workshop, the international, jointly presented, completely virtual International Society of Root Research (ISRR)11/Rooting2021 meeting provided a unique platform for researchers across disciplines to share recent advances in root biology, from molecular to ecosystem-level scales, in agricultural and natural ecosystems, addressing critical questions in response to climate change and its impact on crop productivity and ecosystem services. In this report, the 2021 ISRR Ambassador cohort provides an overview of the current root research landscape and reflection on the importance of frontier research for a more sustainable future. ISRR11 and Rooting2021: A joint, virtual meeting In response to global travel restrictions imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic, the 11th Symposium of the International Society of Root Research (ISRR11, https://www.rootresearch.org/) and the 9th International Symposium on Root Development (Rooting2021) merged into a single online event co-organised by the Interdisciplinary Plant Group at the University of Missouri (Columbia, MO, USA) and the University of Nottingham (UK). Over 700 participants representing academia, government and industry from more than 53 countries (Supporting Information Fig. S1) joined the virtual event held 24–28 May 2021. The schedule ran almost uninterrupted across international time zones, featuring 74 talks (10 plenaries, 16 keynotes, and 48 invited) and c. 300 posters, spanning a broad range of disciplines. In addition, the 2021 ISRR Lifetime Achievement Award was presented to Wendy Silk, Emeritus Professor at the University of California-Davis (USA). The Ambassador Program ISRR11/Rooting2021 hosted the 3rd ISRR Ambassador Program, a unique platform for early-career root researchers. The virtual ISRR11/Rooting2021 Ambassador Program provided networking activities, experience with conference organisation, interaction with professionals in diverse career areas, and opportunities to discuss advances in the field with a broadly multidisciplinary cohort (Notes S1). Ambassador tasks at the ISRR11/Rooting 2021 meeting included session note-taking, the production of this Meeting report, and a set of recommendations for diversity and inclusion in future scientific events (Notes S2). Root phenotyping workshop The ISRR11/Rooting2021 meeting concluded with a root phenotyping workshop with virtual tours of major root phenotyping facilities and demonstrations of methods. Organised by Larry York (Oak Ridge National Laboratory, TN, USA) and Darren Wells (University of Nottingham, UK), in collaboration with other experts and the ISRR Ambassadors, the workshop with a Q&A format was used to discuss the latest advances in root phenotyping techniques. The potential complementarity of image analysis software tools emerged as a key topic as depicted in Fig. S2. The availability of standardised protocols for root collection and trait measurement was also highlighted by the participants of the online survey, organised by the Ambassadors in addition to the Symposium (Delory et al., 2022) and the workshop as an important issue for future research. The Root Ecology Handbook recently published in New Phytologist provides a comprehensive guide on root sampling, processing and measuring for a wide variety of traits in a standardised manner (Freschet et al., 2021). Stress-resilient crops as a root phenotyping target Root phenotyping for traits related to crop performance or ecosystem services has been a main focus in the field of root biology since the 1970s (Hurd, 1974). However, quantitative analysis of plant phenotypes and their linkages to plant functions remains a major bottleneck. ISRR11/Rooting2021 highlighted the current emphasis on phenotyping root traits that will provide resilience to changing environmental conditions (Fig. 1), including traits related to root–microbial interactions (Kawasaki et al., 2021). Rhizosphere processes related to root stress responses are key for sustainable food production systems, as they impact soil functioning and resource use efficiency. Fig. 1Open in figure viewerPowerPoint Schematic overview of root phenotyping targets and methodological approaches discussed at the ISRR11/Rooting2021. The scheme highlights root system traits of interest for plant adaptation to stress, agricultural production and ecosystem services. Relevant methodological approaches to identify root traits are highlighted, including imaging techniques, rhizobiome analysis and rhizosphere metabolomics. Comprehensive collections of root image analysis and modelling tools are currently available (Lobet, 2017). Further phenotyping approaches such as the measurement of ion uptake rates and mechanical measurements were also discussed throughout the meeting. A detailed list can be found in the results of the phenotyping survey (Delory et al., 2022). [Colour figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com] The impact of drought and limited nutrient supply on plants under global climate change, and the mechanisms of root response from molecular to field scales, have prompted focussed advances on well established areas in the field of root research. Therefore, the role of auxin and cytokinin in molecular crosstalk has prompted the rise of the 'hormonics' to explore their functions in root development under drought stress (Rodriguez-Alonso et al., 2018), and to identify signalling pathways that link nutrient availability to root developmental parameters (Shahzad & Amtmann, 2017). Hormonal signalling also underlies 'nutritropism', an extension of 'chemotropism' (Newcombe & Rhodes, 1904), which can now be explored with advanced imaging and microscopy technology (T. Fujiwara, University of Tokyo, Japan). Root-related strategies to mitigate drought stress related to root hydraulic architecture and water transport were also discussed (Maurel & Nacry, 2020). Root-system-level traits linked with water and nutrient use efficiency such as wheat root axial conductance (Hendel et al., 2021), architectural traits in rice (Ruangsiri et al., 2021) and maize (Kistler et al., 2018) have been identified with a combination of shovelomics, phenotyping, functional genomics and modelling. The long-standing challenges of grafting for the introduction of root traits related to stress tolerance have been partially overcome by recent progress on our understanding of graft compatibility and cell-to-cell adhesion (Notaguchi et al., 2020). Advancing our understanding of grafting mechanisms will certainly provide new avenues to understand the effects of specific root genotypes and/or traits on other parts of the plant body (J. Cantillo, Donald Danforth Plant Science Center, MO, USA). Current trends in root research seek to integrate stress responses inside the root system with a better understanding of these root–soil–microbe interactions. ISRR11/Rooting2021 highlighted the role of the rhizosphere microbiome in nutrient homeostasis, for example, in root diffusion (Salas-González et al., 2021), or during nitrogen acquisition (Arsova et al., 2012). Root exudates were introduced as potential targets for rhizosphere engineering to promote beneficial microbiome functionalities (Kawasaki et al., 2021) or to control harmful species. Novel studies looking into root–microbiome interactions have become possible due to precision genome editing, production of knocked-down lines and reconstruction of biosynthetic metabolic pathways (Huang et al., 2019), and advanced imaging techniques such as positron emission tomography (Schmidt et al., 2020). Roadmap to high-throughput root phenotyping Recent advances in imaging techniques and image analysis (Fig. 1) can support high-throughput root phenotyping of relevant structural features within the root architecture (Fig. 2). Detailed image-based root phenotyping techniques such as X-ray computed tomography (CT) scanning can improve our interpretation of in-field studies (C. Topp, Donald Danforth Plant Science Center, MO, USA). Current advances allow high-resolution and/or high-throughput phenotyping studies, even in mature crops and under field conditions (Gore et al., 2020; Rich et al., 2020), although methodological challenges remain (Delory et al., 2022). For example, root phenotyping of rooting depth and its significance for deep water or nitrate uptake is being addressed with large-scale field experiments using minirhizotrons or soil coring on maize (A. Leakey, University of Illinois, USA), wheat (J. Christopher, University of Queensland, Australia) and potatoes (O. Popovic, Copenhagen University, Denmark). Automated, high-resolution minirhizotrons are also used for visualising the dynamics of roots and fungi interaction in experimentally warmed peatlands (C. Iversen, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, TN, USA; Defrenne et al., 2020). These imaging advances are complemented by the development of free, open source and high-performance image analysis software (Fig. S2).

[Colour figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com] Pairing 3D imaging techniques (e.g. X-ray CT) with mathematical modelling is a powerful way to study plant–soil interactions on different scales, from soil pores to growing root systems (Roose et al., 2016). This hybrid approach has resulted in key milestones by allowing the elucidation of how root architecture and exudation jointly affect P mobilisation and uptake (McKay Fletcher et al., 2020), and to quantify the extent to which the dissolution of N fertiliser granules affects soil microbial activity (Ruiz et al., 2020). Imaging techniques can also be used for traits related to root–microbe interactions (Fig. 1), complementing other multidisciplinary approaches that seek to better understand the complex dialogue between roots, the associated microbiome and soil processes. Unleashing the power of mathematical modelling Mathematical modelling complements phenotyping advances by overcoming the challenges of experimental approaches and benefits from the emerging field of functional phenomics (York, 2019). Highlights from the diversity of modelling approaches presented at ISRR/Rooting2021, in both spatial and temporal scales, include: a micro-hydrological model that describes a new symplastic water pumping mechanism (Couvreur et al., 2021); the dynamics and regulation of a fast brassinosteroid response pathway in Arabidopsis root tips (Großeholz et al., 2021); functional–structural plant (FSP) models to identify optimal root phenotypes for nutrient capture in contrasting environments (Rangarajan, 2021); and field-scale simulations of plant populations and communities (Postma et al., 2017; Schnepf et al., 2018; Faverjon et al., 2019). Future mathematical models will draw on larger, more complex, datasets incorporating novel imaging technology, high-throughput phenotyping and availability of relevant environmental data. The positive feedback cycles between these models and continued advances in phenotyping are what will surely advance the field of root science. Concluding remarks and perspectives To meet the challenges imposed by the global COVID-19 pandemic, online communication has provided new opportunities for international multidisciplinary cooperation. The ISRR11/Rooting2021 online event brought the root research community together to share knowledge on the latest developments in root and rhizosphere research, present new technological advances and identify pressing research questions that still require answers. The adoption of a holistic approach to root research, that is, one that takes into account all categories of root traits, from anatomy to root morphology, physiology and architecture, as well as interactions with the rhizosphere microbiota, was emphasised as a crucial step in facing the challenges posed by global change. We encourage root researchers to actively take advantage of the plethora of online resources currently available for plant phenotyping (https://quantitative-plant.org/), and to join the ISRR (https://www.rootresearch.org/). Collaborations to share knowledge, along with new technological advances, will help us further understand roots and rhizosphere processes.

rayyan-210754613,Towards automatic detection of wildlife trade using machine vision models,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Unsustainable trade in wildlife is one of the major threats affecting the global biodiversity crisis. An important part of the trade now occurs on the internet, especially on digital marketplaces and social media. Automated methods to identify trade posts are needed as resources for conservation are limited. Here, we developed machine vision models based on Deep Neural Networks with the aim to automatically identify images of exotic pet animals for sale. A new training dataset representing exotic pet animals advertised for sale on the web was generated for this purpose. We trained 24 neural-net models spanning a combination of five different architectures, three methods of training and two types of datasets. Specifically, model generalisation improved after setting a portion of the training images to represent negative features. Models were evaluated on both within and out of distribution data to test wider model applicability. The top performing models achieved an f-score of over 0.95 on within distribution evaluation and between 0.75 to 0.87 on the two out of distribution datasets. Notably, feature visualisation indicated that models performed well in detecting the surrounding context (e.g. a cage) in which an animal was located, therefore helping to automatically detect images of animals in non-natural environments. The proposed methods can help investigate the online wildlife trade, but can also be adapted to study other types of people-nature interactions from digital platforms. Future studies can use these findings to build robust machine learning models and new data collection pipelines for more taxonomic groups.","",https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2205.11324,"",,
rayyan-210754670,Semantic Indexing of Open Scientific Literature to Help Users Discover and Navigate through Publications Networks,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"In recent years, several evolutions have drastically transformed the way researchers as well as scientific and technical information (STI) services interact with scientific literature. The amount and pace of publications are skyrocketing, whether in journals and conferences or through pre-publication repositories (e.g., arxiv.org), such that it is increasingly difficult to keep up, find and make sense of relevant articles. Furthermore, the specialization of research communities makes it difficult to discover cross-disciplinary knowledge, which is essential to meet the growing demand of funding agencies for interdisciplinary projects. Scientific open archives are central in this landscape, however the keyword-based search services that they usually provide fail to grasp the semantic relationships between articles. Therefore, it is necessary to develop new tools that allow users to find their way in this mass of knowledge. In this talk, we wish to present the methods, tools and services implemented in the ISSA*2 project to address these needs, and discuss how they could fit and be deployed in the biodiversity area. Guided by the open science goals and embracing the FAIR*1 principles, the project aims to: provide a generic, transferable and extensible pipeline for the analysis and processing of the articles of an open scientific archive; turn the processing results into a semantic index stored and published as a public RDF knowledge graph; develop innovative search and visualization services that leverage this semantic index to allow researchers, decision makers or STI professionals to explore thematic association rules, networks of co-publications, articles with co-occurring topics, etc. provide a generic, transferable and extensible pipeline for the analysis and processing of the articles of an open scientific archive; turn the processing results into a semantic index stored and published as a public RDF knowledge graph; develop innovative search and visualization services that leverage this semantic index to allow researchers, decision makers or STI professionals to explore thematic association rules, networks of co-publications, articles with co-occurring topics, etc. The semantic index construction process involves several artificial intelligence techniques: natural language processing, knowledge engineering and Semantic Web. These techniques are used to process the publications’ metadata and text to automatically extract thematic descriptors and named entities. These descriptors and named entities are linked to knowledge bases such as Wikidata, DBpedia and GeoNames, or domain-specific terminological resources suited to the archive's domain. The semantic index linked with the third-party resources serves as a keystone to support the development of rich search and visualization tools aimed at researchers and/or STI professionals. We demonstrated the effectiveness of this solution in the use case of Agritrop, an institutional archive of 110,000+ resources among which are 12,000 open access articles, specialized in the fields of agronomy, biodiversity and sustainable development. In this context, the Agrovoc multilingual thesaurus was used as a domain-specific reference vocabulary. Fig. 1 illustrates how the concepts mentioned in the articles of the archive can be used to discover and visualize association rules. In this example, articles mentioning concepts COVID-19 and food security (a) frequently mention concept pandemics (b). Fig. 2 shows how other visualization techniques can help users search articles mentioning concept health or any of its sub-concepts (a and b), discover that it is often co-mentioned with climate change (c), and get the list of related publications (d) and their time distribution (e). Being designed as a generic, transferable solution, the pipeline and visualization tools delivered by ISSA could be easily adapted to open archives of biodiversity literature. Typically, terminological references such as Darwin Core Terms, Access to Biological Collection Data (ABCD), open Digital Specimens (openDS), Audubon Core Metadata Schema as well as various taxonomic registries, could be considered for the description of an article's metadata or the linking of thematic descriptors and named entities. From there, the proposed visualization techniques could easily be reconfigured to explore the articles from a biodiversity open archive to answer various competency questions, for instance: what are the articles that mention a taxon or any of its child taxa? What are the museums/institutions that are more frequently mentioned together with certain taxonomic groups? What are the research topics that frequently co-occur with climate change, and how do these topics evolve through the years? What public policies frequently occur in articles that mention endangered species? Furthermore, the pipeline could be extended by including existing third-party tools to carry out e.g., the extraction of relationships between entities or the reconciliation of authors' names.","",https://doi.org/10.3897/biss.6.93640,"",,
rayyan-210754698,Comparing global Sentinel-2 land cover maps for regional species distribution modelling,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Mapping the spatial and temporal dynamics of species distributions is necessary for biodiversity conservation land-use planning decisions. Recent advances in remote sensing and machine learning have allowed for high resolution species distribution modelling that can inform landscape-level decision making. Here we compare the performance of three popular Sentinel-2 (10m) land cover maps including Dynamic World (DW), European land cover (ELC10) and World Cover (WC), in predicting wild bee species richness over southern Norway. The proportion of grassland habitat within 250m (derived from the land cover maps), along with temperature and distance to sandy soils, were used as predictors in both Bayesian Regularized Neural Network and Random Forest models. Models using grassland habitat from DW performed best (RMSE = 2.85; averaged across models), followed by WC (RMSE = 2.86) and ELC10 (RMSE = 2.89). All satellite-derived maps outperformed a manually mapped Norwegian land cover dataset called AR5 (RMSE = 3.02). When validating the model predictions of bee species richness against citizen science data on solitary bee occurrences using generalized linear models, we found that ELC10 performed best (AIC = 2800), followed by WC (AIC = 2939), and DW (AIC = 2973). While the differences in RMSE we observed between models were small, they may be significant when such models are used to prioritize grassland patches within a landscape for conservation subsidies or management policies. Partial dependencies in our models showed that increasing the proportion of grassland habitat is positively associated with wild bee species richness, thereby justifying bee conservation schemes that aim to enhance semi-natural grassland habitat. Our results confirm the utility of satellite-derived land cover maps in supporting high resolution species distribution modelling and suggest there is scope to monitor changes in species distributions over time given the dense time series provided by products like DW.","",https://doi.org/10.22541/au.166870026.66567319/v1,"",,
rayyan-210754730,Drivers of mangrove vulnerability and resilience to tropical cyclones in the North Atlantic Basin,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract The North Atlantic Basin (NAB) is seeing a significant increase in the frequency and intensity of tropical cyclones since the 1980s, with record-breaking seasons such as 2017 and 2020. However, little is known about how coastal ecosystems, particularly mangroves in the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean, are responding to these new “climate normals” at regional and subregional scales. Wind speed, rainfall, pre-cyclone forest structure, and hydro-geomorphology are known to influence mangrove damage and recovery following cyclones in the NAB. However, these studies have focused on site-specific responses and individual cyclonic events. Here, we analyze 25 years (1996-2020) of mangrove vulnerability (damage after a cyclone) and short-term resilience (recovery after damage) for the entire NAB and its subregions, using multi-annual, remote sensing-derived databases. We applied machine learning to characterize the influence of 22 potential drivers that include previously researched variables and new ones such as human development and long-term climate trends. The characteristics of the cyclones mainly drive vulnerability at the regional level, while resilience is largely driven by site-specific conditions. These include long-term climate conditions, such as air temperature and drought trends, pre-cyclone habitat conditions, such as canopy cover and height and soil organic carbon stock, and human interventions on the land. Rates and drivers of mangrove vulnerability and resilience vary across subregions in the NAB, and hotspots for restoration and conservation actions are highlighted within subregions. The impacts of increasing cyclone activity need to be framed in the context of climate change compound effects and heavy human influences in the region. There is an urgent need to value the restoration and conservation of mangroves as fundamental Nature-based Solutions against cyclone impacts in the NAB.","",https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.11.22.517275,"",,
rayyan-210754793,Advancing terrestrial biodiversity monitoring with satellite remote sensing in the context of the Kunming-Montreal global biodiversity framework,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract Satellite remote sensing (SRS) provides huge potential for tracking progress towards conservation targets and goals, but SRS products need to be tailored towards the requirements of ecological users and policymakers. In this viewpoint article, we propose to advance SRS products with a terrestrial biodiversity focus for tracking the goals and targets of the Kunming-Montreal global biodiversity framework (GBF). Of 371 GBF biodiversity indicators, we identified 58 unique indicators for tracking the state of terrestrial biodiversity, spanning 2 goals and 8 targets. Thirty-six shared enough information to analyse their underlying workflows and spatial information products. We used the concept of Essential Biodiversity Variables (EBV) to connect spatial information products to different dimensions of biodiversity (e.g. species populations, species traits, and ecosystem structure), and then counted EBV usage across GBF goals and targets. Combined with published scores on feasibility, accuracy, and immaturity of SRS products, we identified a priority list of terrestrial SRS products representing opportunities for scientific development in the next decade. From this list, we suggest two key directions for advancing SRS products and workflows in the GBF context using current instruments and technologies. First, existing terrestrial ecosystem distributions and live cover fraction SRS products (of above-ground biomass, ecosystem fragmentation, ecosystem structural variance, fraction of vegetation cover, plant area index profile, and land cover) need to be refined using a co-design approach to achieve harmonized ecosystem taxonomies, reference states and improved thematic detail. Second, new SRS products related to plant physiology and primary productivity (e.g. leaf area index, chlorophyll content &amp; flux, foliar N/P/K content, and carbon cycle) need to be developed to better estimate plant functional traits, especially with deep learning techniques, radiative transfer models and multi-sensor frameworks. Advancements along these two routes could greatly improve the tracking of GBF target 2 (‘improve connectivity of priority terrestrial ecosystems), target 3 (‘ensure management of protected areas’), target 6 (‘control the introduction and impact of invasive alien species’), target 8 (‘minimize impact of climate change on biodiversity’), target 10 (‘increase sustainable productivity of agricultural and forested ecosystems’) and target 12 (‘increase public urban green/blue spaces’). Such improvements can have secondary benefits for other EBVs, e.g. as predictor variables for modelling species distributions and population abundances (i.e. data that are required in several GBF indicators). We hope that our viewpoint stimulates the advancement of biodiversity monitoring from space and a stronger collaboration among ecologists, SRS scientists and policy experts.","",https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.04.25.489356,"",,
rayyan-210754830,Developing and Maintaining a National Biodiversity Data Infrastructure – An example from Norway,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Biodiversity data infrastructures are fundamental to halting the ongoing loss of species and habitats. Here we provide an overview of the national biodiversity data infrastructure developed and implemented in Norway by The Norwegian Biodiversity Information Centre (NBIC). Key elements and properties of this infrastructure are highlighted and directions for future development are outlined. The overarching objective for the infrastructure is to make data on habitats and species in Norway available for policy and decision makers, researchers and the general public. Here we will focus on data on species and their distribution. The infrastructure is built as a modular system but with a high level of integration between the components. NBIC has the main responsibility for developing and managing the infrastructure in collaboration with natural history museums, research organizations, private companies and non-governmental organizations (NGOs), including the Norwegian node of the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF). The infrastructure includes a citizen science portal that gives both amateurs and professionals the possibility to report species sightings. The data from this portal together with data from natural history museums and other data providers are then made available though the Species Map Service website. The infrastructure also includes the Norwegian taxonomic backbone database and a trait bank that is under development. The trait bank is planned to contain both ecological traits but also other information about species such as Red List status. The infrastructure builds on a few simple principles. The exchange of data is based on the Darwin Core Standard and its extensions, or other open data standards. Each data owner is responsible for quality control, secure storage and management of their own data. The data owners publish the data using the Integrated Publishing Toolkit (IPT) developed by GBIF. NBIC then harvests all observations with spatial coordinates that fall within Norway and adds information about, for example, status on the Norwegian Red List before the data are made available in the map. The core parts of the infrastructure only handle data that are open and adhere to the FAIR principles, i.e. that the data are Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and available for Reuse. An important exception to this principle is observations of threatened species that are particularly vulnerable to human disturbance. Sensitive data are managed in a separate, secure system and with a restricted access portal for data viewing. Data in the Species Map Service are also available through a public API, which can be used to harvest and import the data or subsets of it into other systems and services. To give an example, the forestry industry integrates data on Red Listed species into their planning systems tools and has even an option to display a subset of species occurrences on their forestry machine computers. NBIC has in cooperation with NGOs established a system in which experts validate observations that are reported through the citizen science portal. As it is not possible to validate all observations, species of particular interest for environmental management and conservation are given priority. A future solution could be to develop a system that can identify observations with a low likelihood of being correct using, for example, statistical models that describe the likelihood of an occurrence in a given space and environment. If photos are available, image recognition based on machine learning can be used to spot species that are likely to be misidentified. It is also possible/conceivable to use a more heuristic approach based on an ontology for organisms and ecological traits (for example, ""this is a fish, fish are always aquatic organisms, this observation was made on dry land and is thus unlikely to be true""). The development of improved tools and systems to improve data quality is a major task for future development of the infrastructure. In Norway, spatial planning processes and decisions are required to integrate information made available through the infrastructure. If new information about the occurrence of Red Listed species or other species of special interest for environmental management and conservation are discovered through the planning process, the developer is responsible for archiving these observations in a publicly available database. Key factors for the success of the biodiversity data infrastructure described here are: (i) the close cooperation between NBIC, data providers, NGO's and data users, (ii) the modularity of the infrastructure, (iii) the use of open and flexible standards for data exchange, and (iv) the integration of the infrastructure in the legal framework for spatial planning requiring that data from e.g., environmental impact assessments are made available through the infrastructure.","",https://doi.org/10.3897/biss.6.94078,"",,
rayyan-210754831,Wildlife Insights: How Camera Trap Data Can Foster Global Biodiversity Conservation,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Human activities are driving environmental and climatic changes, affecting the distribution and diversity of species worldwide. Limiting the negative impacts of these activities on wildlife requirestimely knowledge of status and trends in populations over large scales. Camera trapping providesopportunities to simultaneously collect information on several species over large spatio-temporalscales. However, the time required to process large collections of images, the statistical andprogrammatic skills needed to analyze large sets of data, and a general lack of homogeneity in metadata standards hinder the use of camera trapping for local and global conservation. WildlifeInsights (http://wildlifeinsights.org/; WI) is a web platform that promotes and supports the use andsharing of camera-trap data for species conservation and promotes the mobilization of records thatotherwise might be permanently siloed in private data-storage units or lost over time. WI speeds upthe processing of images via an AI model trained to classify >700 species, and automates commonstatistical analysis through a standardized, accessible user interface. It also provides tools to addresscommon issues faced by camera trappers, such as the need of hiding locations of sensitive speciesand removing images of humans, and has a transparent infrastructure to request, share and citedatasets. Although only recently open to the public, the platform already hosts tens of millionsrecords, most of which publicly accessible, from more than 50 countries and 1000 species. Using datashared in WI, we assessed whether information collected using camera traps improved the spatial,temporal, taxonomical, and ecological coverage of many species compared to records available inmore traditional open-access repositories such as GBIF. Birds and mammals, and countries with ahigh proportion of remote areas and biodiversity had the largest increases in coverage.

rayyan-210754851,On multiple drivers predicting ecosystem functioning in a tropical forest,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Understand the relative contribution of different factors that can determine the structure and diversity of forest communities along environmental gradients and secondary succession time has been a relevant theme in contemporary ecology. Recently the impact of these environmental factors (e.g., soils, topography, and climate) on biodiversity-ecosystem function relationship has gained importance in understanding tropical forests. Topographic and edaphic gradients together with climate can influence the distribution of functional traits, and consequently, ecosystem functioning. The study of the secondary succession of tropical forests with an approach based on the relation of functional traits and environmental factors has allowed elucidating emerging patterns of the ecosystem processes, mainly of the production and storage of biomass. Thus, the community weighted mean (CWM) are the diversity metrics to test effects on aboveground biomass. This research will assess how abiotic factors and biotic factors affect the assembly of tree communities and the ecosystem functioning of the forest Atlantic in southeastern Brazil. For this, we will analyze how species richness, composition and dominance can change through edaphic-topographic-climatic gradients and time of succession in permanent plots. For this, the following hypotheses will be tested: (1) The edaphic-topographic factors and the time of succession affect the richness, composition and dominance of the species in terms of their contribution to an ecosystem process (2) the variability climate over time of succession has implications for the classification of leaf phenology groups of tree communities. Finally, (3) we propose that AGB increases with time of succession, but changes depending on environmental variability (soil and topography), and that the variation in biomass can be explained by the functional traits of the species through functional dominance (CWM) in secondary forest communities. To answer these questions, we selected three areas with different topographic conditions located in a fragment in the secondary regeneration stage in Viçosa, MG, Brazil. Each area has permanent plots of 1 ha covering a topographic gradient from the valleys to the plateau. Each permanent plot has 100 subplots of 10m x 10m. Totaling two hectares of forest and 200 subplots. In each subplot, all individuals of the living arboreal species with stem circumference showed a height of 10 cm or greater and a height of 130 cm. For each subplot, three topographic variables (elevation, slope and convexity) were measured and calculated using a total station with the aid of an engineer and surface soil samples with a depth of 0 to 10 cm to determine physical and chemical parameters. The aboveground biomass was calculated for each tree individual sampled in the subplots by an allometric equation. We selected different types of functional traits such as leaf phenology, wood density and tree diameter. Multivariate regression analyzes were performed to classify habitat types according to topographic variables and species composition. In addition, we constructed a series of models to explain the effect of potential predictor variables on the response of species richness, species composition, and ecosystem functioning. We also used machine learning to classify leaf phenology groups under the effect of environmental variables. Our study demonstrated that topographic variability, mainly elevation and convexity, determine soil fertility. These results advance our understanding that context-dependent conditions based on topography and soil properties have a high variability at a fine-scale. Furthermore, we found that different topographic conditions and successional timing affect community composition, richness, abundance and proportion of carbon-dominant species over time. We found that different topographic conditions and stand age change community composition, richness, abundance, and carbon dominant species along the late-secondary stage. This study advances our understanding of the mechanisms that drive carbon stock in tropical forests and supports the ‘mass ratio’ hypothesis. We observe that evergreen species show higher richness; meanwhile the deciduous species has a greater contribution to aboveground carbon stock. Thus, the leaf phenology groups can affect the relationships between species richness and aboveground carbon stock. For example, deciduous species are key to maintaining higher carbon stock with smaller numbers of species; meanwhile evergreen species are important to maintain a higher species richness. Thus, we presumed that the leaf phenology group's distribution could be responsible for the cobenefits (positive aboveground carbon stock and species richness relationship) in tropical forests. Using random forest, it was observed that the most influential predictor in the classification of functional groups was topography and soil properties. We emphasize that the information generated in this research can be important for the planning of forest restoration activities (passive and active) based on the high variability of environmental variables on a local scale. We also emphasize the relevance of the functional traits approach to understanding the functioning, conservation and management of tropical forests. Keywords: Biotic and abiotic factors. Cobenefits.

rayyan-210754964,Social media and deep learning reveal specific cultural preferences for biodiversity,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract Social media has created new opportunities to map cultural ecosystem services (CES) related to biodiversity at large scales. However, using these novel data to understand people's preferences in relation to these CES remains a challenge. To address this, we trained a deep learning model to capture people's interactions with selected flora and fauna on Flickr as a cultural service related to biodiversity and compared this with citizen science data on iNaturalist, with photos of individual species considered as human–species interactions. After mapping the distribution of people's interactions in Great Britain on Flickr and iNaturalist, we find significant spatial differences in people's preferences on the two platforms. Using a second, pretrained deep learning model, we were also able to identify different preferences for species groups such as birds on social media versus citizen science. To better understand people's preferences, we also compared people's interactions with species richness and abundance for a group of 36 bird species, sometimes finding large differences between people's interactions and these ecological measures. Our findings demonstrate that social media can be used to include a wider range of preferences in CES assessments along‐side citizen science data.

rayyan-210754973,Image‐based taxonomic classification of bulk insect biodiversity samples using deep learning and domain adaptation,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract Complex bulk samples of insects from biodiversity surveys present a challenge for taxonomic identification, which could be overcome by high‐throughput imaging combined with machine learning for rapid classification of specimens. These procedures require that taxonomic labels from an existing source data set are used for model training and prediction of an unknown target sample. However, such transfer learning may be problematic for the study of new samples not previously encountered in an image set, for example, from unexplored ecosystems, and require methods of domain adaptation that reduce the differences in the feature distribution of the source and target domains (training and test sets). We assessed the efficiency of domain adaptation for family‐level classification of bulk samples of Coleoptera, as a critical first step in the characterization of biodiversity samples. Neural network models trained with images from a global database of Coleoptera were applied to a biodiversity sample from understudied forests in Cyprus as the target. Within‐dataset classification accuracy reached 98% and depended on the number and quality of training images, and on dataset complexity. The accuracy of between‐datasets predictions (across disparate source–target pairs that do not share any species or genera) was at most 82% and depended greatly on the standardization of the imaging procedure. An algorithm for domain adaptation, domain adversarial training of neural networks (DANN), significantly improved the prediction performance of models trained by non‐standardized, low‐quality images. Our findings demonstrate that existing databases can be used to train models and successfully classify images from unexplored biota, but the imaging conditions and classification algorithms need careful consideration.","",https://doi.org/10.1111/syen.12583,"",,

They are an important habitat for many animal and plant species and offer a variety of ecological functions. Diverse plant communities have evolved over time depending on environmental and management factors in grasslands. These different plant communities offer multiple ecosystem services and also have an effect on the forage value of fodder for domestic livestock. However, with increasing intensification in agriculture and the loss of SNGs, the biodiversity of grasslands continues to decline. In this paper, we present a method to spatially classify plant communities in grasslands in order to identify and map plant communities and weed species that occur in a semi-natural meadow. For this, high-resolution multispectral remote sensing data were captured by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) in regular intervals and classified by a convolutional neural network (CNN). As the study area, a heterogeneous semi-natural hay meadow with first- and second-growth vegetation was chosen. Botanical relevés of fixed plots were used as ground truth and independent test data. Accuracies up to 88% on these independent test data were achieved, showing the great potential of the usage of CNNs for plant community mapping in high-resolution UAV data for ecological and agricultural applications.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/rs15071945,"",,
rayyan-210755273,Using ChatGPT with Confidence for Biodiversity-Related Information Tasks,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Recent advancements in conversational Artificial Intelligence (AI), such as OpenAI's Chat Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (ChatGPT), present the possibility of using large language models (LLMs) as tools for retrieving, analyzing, and transforming scientific information. We have found that ChatGPT (GPT 3.5) can provide accurate biodiversity knowledge in response to questions about species descriptions, occurrences, and taxonomy, as well as structure information according to data sharing standards such as Darwin Core. A rigorous evaluation of ChatGPT's capabilities in biodiversity-related tasks may help to inform viable use cases for today's LLMs in research and information workflows. In this work, we test the extent of ChatGPT's biodiversity knowledge, characterize its mistakes, and suggest how LLM-based systems might be designed to complete knowledge-based tasks with confidence. To test ChatGPT's biodiversity knowledge, we compiled a question-and-answer test set derived from Darwin Core records available in Integrated Digitized Biocollections (iDigBio). Each question focuses on one or more Darwin Core terms to test the model’s ability to recall species occurrence information and its understanding of the standard. The test set covers a range of locations, taxonomic groups, and both common and rare species (defined by the number of records in iDigBio). The results of the tests will be presented. We also tested ChatGPT on generative tasks, such as creating species occurrence maps. A visual comparison of the maps with iDigBio data shows that for some species, ChatGPT can generate fairly accurate representationsof their geographic ranges (Fig. 1). ChatGPT's incorrect responses in our tests show several patterns of mistakes. First, responses can be self-conflicting. For example, when asked ""Does Acer saccharum naturally occur in Benton, Oregon?"", ChatGPT responded ""YES, Acer saccharum DOES NOT naturally occur in Benton, Oregon"". ChatGPT can also be misled by semantics in species names. For Rafinesquia neomexicana , the word ""neomexicana"" leads ChatGPT to believe that the species primarily occurs in New Mexico, USA. ChatGPT may also confuse species, such as when attempting to describe a lesser-known species (e.g., a rare bee) within the same genus as a better-known species. Other causes of mistakes include hallucination (Ji et al. 2023), memorization (Chang and Bergen 2023), and user deception (Li et al. 2023). Some mistakes may be avoided by prompt engineering, e.g., few-shot prompting (Chang and Bergen 2023) and chain-of-thought prompting (Wei et al. 2022). These techniques assist Large Language Models (LLMs) by clarifying expectations or by guiding recollection. However, such methods cannot help when LLMs lack required knowledge. In these cases, alternative approaches are needed. A desired reliability can be theoretically guaranteed if responses that contain mistakes are discarded or corrected. This requires either detecting or predicting mistakes. Sometimes mistakes can be ruled out by verifying responses with a trusted source. For example, a trusted specimen record might be found that corroborates the response. The difficulty, however, is finding such records programmatically; e.g., using iDigBio and Global Biodiversity Information Facility's (GBIF) search Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) requires specifying indexed terms that might not appear in an LLM's response. This presents a secondary problem for which LLMs may be well suited. Note that with presence-only data, it can be difficult to disprove presence claims or prove absence claims. Besides verification, mistakes may be predicted using probabilistic methods. Formulating mistake probabilities often relies on heuristics. For example, variability in a model’s responses to a repeated query can be a sign of hallucination (Manakul et al. 2023). In practice, both probabilistic and verification methods may be needed to reach a desired reliability. LLM outputs that can be verified may be directly accepted (or discarded), while others are judged by estimating mistake probabilities. We will consider a set of heuristics and verification methods, and report empirical assessments of their impact on ChatGPT’s reliability.","",https://doi.org/10.3897/biss.7.112926,"",,

Environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding is a rapidly expanding scientific method for determining species' existence in the environment. It includes sequencing DNA from environmental samples. This work investigates how machine learning (ML) could be used in eDNA metabarcoding to enhance biodiversity estimates. Reviewing current work on the use of ML in eDNA metabarcoding, this paper focuses on the various ML algorithms utilized, the varied kinds of data inputs, and the advances in biodiversity assessment that occur. In 23 investigations, machine learning (ML) was used for Environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding. In terms of increasing the precision and effectiveness of eDNA metabarcoding for biodiversity assessments, ML has shown encouraging outcomes. In addition to accurately classifying and predicting species from eDNA sequences, ML algorithms may uncover uncommon or invasive species often overlooked by conventional techniques. According to the research we looked at, compared to conventional approaches, there was an average increase of 20% in detection sensitivity and 14% in species richness. Adding ML to eDNA metabarcoding has enormous promise for enhancing ecological monitoring and biodiversity assessments. Nonetheless, it is essential to choose suitable ML algorithms, ensure there are enough training datasets, and assess the accuracy of the predictions made by ML. This research underscores the need for more investigation to fully fulfill ML's potential for ecological monitoring and conservation while providing a thorough review of its possible uses in eDNA metabarcoding.","",https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-2823060/v1,"",,
rayyan-210755591,Combining environmental DNA with remote sensing variables to map fish species distributions along a large river,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract Biodiversity loss in river ecosystems is much faster and more severe than in terrestrial systems, and spatial conservation and restoration plans are needed to halt this erosion. Reliable and highly resolved data on the state of and change in biodiversity and species distributions are critical for effective measures. However, high‐resolution maps of fish distribution remain limited for large riverine systems. Coupling data from global satellite sensors with broad‐scale environmental DNA (eDNA) and machine learning could enable rapid and precise mapping of the distribution of river organisms. Here, we investigated the potential for combining these methods using a fish eDNA dataset from 110 sites sampled along the full length of the Rhone River in Switzerland and France. Using Sentinel 2 and Landsat 8 images, we generated a set of ecological variables describing both the aquatic and the terrestrial habitats surrounding the river corridor. We combined these variables with eDNA‐based presence and absence data on 29 fish species and used three machine‐learning models to assess environmental suitability for these species. Most models showed good performance, indicating that ecological variables derived from remote sensing can approximate the ecological determinants of fish species distributions, but water‐derived variables had stronger associations than the terrestrial variables surrounding the river. The species range mapping indicated a significant transition in the species occupancy along the Rhone, from its source in the Swiss Alps to outlet into the Mediterranean Sea in southern France. Our study demonstrates the feasibility of combining remote sensing and eDNA to map species distributions in a large river.

Realizing this vision depends on effectively monitoring progress toward the GBF's goals and targets. However, the GBF's current monitoring framework (Convention on Biological Diversity, 2022) has fundamental gaps. Of its 27 goals and targets, only nine have a complete set of headline indicators, while most goals either have no indicators to track their achievement or have at least one indicator that is only conceptual. Of particular concern is the lack of indicators to track human attitudes toward species, biomes, and biodiversity more broadly. Monitoring human attitudes and behavior is critical to achieve several key GBF targets. For example, Targets 4 and 6 aim to resolve human–wildlife conflict and manage invasive species, respectively (Convention on Biological Diversity, 2022). These threat processes are inherently linked to human dimensions, so any monitoring focused solely on ecological measurement—and ignoring human behaviors and attitudes—will be at best incomplete. In the context of human–wildlife conflict, large-scale assessments have predicted conflict zones for species across continental scales using data on species ranges as well as human population densities, assuming an overlap in species range and human population leads to increased conflict risk. This assumption may hold at global scales, but conservation policy often unfolds at national-local scales, where highly heterogenous human behaviors and attitudes are the key factor influencing conflict risk. For instance, conflicts do not always correlate with physical damage or loss, with some societies and cultures being more tolerant to the presence of substantial damage and others retaining a high level of conflict even when species cause only negligible loss. Ultimately, our ability to understand and predict human-mediated threats such as human–wildlife conflict is contingent upon capturing this heterogeneity in behaviors and attitudes. The same is true for threats such as biological invasion. In this context, our ability to successfully conserve species will depend not only on our ability to detect and map threats such as biological invasions but also on understanding public attitudes toward these threats. This approach of integrating social indicators into ecological indicators offers unprecedented insight and conservation potential. For instance, social indicators may reveal an increased interest in people purchasing invasive tropical plants for their garden, which could be used as an early-warning signal to assess and forecast the ecological risk of the impact. Under high risk, we should mobilize to promote behavioral change and awareness of impacts to mitigate risks. This approach shifts conservation from reactive to proactive, halting declines in their tracks. Such approaches are already being researched with online digital data (Jarić et al., 2021). Improved monitoring of people's attitudes and behaviors can also help capture the willingness of societies to mobilize support for biodiversity conservation. In many contexts, political actors as well as businesses will take into account potential reputational damage when making a decision, so demonstrating public support can be a way to influence decision-making. These indicators can also help to engage the public in conservation practice and questions pertaining to conservation ethics. For instance, conservationists can employ and endorse a controversial array of conservation approaches from lethal control to rewilding. These approaches can often be defended on conservation grounds but can evoke strong reactions from the public. Social indicators can track this public awareness of conservation topics and ideally engage an informed public in conservation decision-making. Ultimately, readily available and up-to-date social indicators can help design conservation practices that are not only effective but also just, equitable, and ethically permissible—key criteria of GBF target 22. When the previous GBF targets were established in Aichi, Japan, collecting data on global-scale human–nature interactions in a cost-effective manner was largely unattainable. Consequently, only about 10 countries had comparative data available to evaluate progress toward Aichi Target 1, which focused on awareness of the value of biodiversity and steps to conserve it (Secretariat of the Convention on Biological Diversity, 2020). Arguably, this target was most directly linked with human dimensions. With increased access to the internet, now at 66% globally (International Telecommunication Union, 2022), alongside greater access to data sources such as social media platforms, and advances in machine learning, cloud computing, and natural language processing, new kinds of social science analyses are now available (Fink et al., 2020). It is now possible to understand how attitudes and behaviors toward different elements of biodiversity vary in real time at local, national, and global scales (Fink et al., 2020; Johnson et al., 2023)—a key requirement of the GBF. Such insights can in turn inform policy in a more responsive and cost-effective manner (Caetano et al., 2023). For example, using sentiment analysis and named entity recognition, it is possible to use digital mass media websites to map human–wildlife conflict between elephants and humans across time and space in near real-time. It is also possible to leverage computer vision alongside photos posted on social media to detect when an invasive species is documented in a new location, which can highlight the need for conservation action early on, making eradication easier. Despite the promising potential of expanding internet access at the global scale, it is important to highlight that significant disparities still exist in various areas. These disparities are evident when considering factors such as gender, income, and urban or rural settings (International Telecommunication Union, 2022). While these gaps have been gradually shrinking (International Telecommunication Union, 2022), it is apparent that in many cases, obtaining insights relevant to the current decade will require a combination of online and offline data collection methods to ensure the creation of nationally representative datasets. Other challenges to reaching a truly global representation include the challenges in translating content across multiple languages, a process that can lead to loss of meaning. This process has recently become easier with the aid of Artificial Intelligence and Large Language models. However, these methods have their own challenges, namely, around their embedded cultural and social biases, since they mostly originate from Western languages with their particular linguistic features. There is much to be done in developing the current GBF monitoring framework. Integrating social indicators is a critical next step. Social indicators can offer unprecedented insight into how attitudes and behaviors drive threats, reveal early-warning signals of biodiversity declines, and promote a transformation in conservation practice. Ultimately, social indicators offer the potential to avert declines and bend the biodiversity curve toward recovery.","",https://doi.org/10.1111/conl.12991,"",,

In this study, three different diversity indices (Simpson (λ), Shannon (H'), and Pielou (J')), were tested to characterize forest tree species diversity using individual monthly and multi-temporal Sentinel-1 and -2 images during 2021. The performance of three different machine learning models, Random Forest (RF), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), and Deep Neural Network (DNN) were tested. A collection of 1,020 plot measurements (comprising 47 tree species and 28,122 trees), randomly collected in a mixed broadleaf-conifer forest area in northeast China, was used to train (n = 816) and validate (n = 204) the models. The models dependent on multi-temporal Sentinel-1/2 imagery were found to outperform the models based on individual monthly data, in predicting forest tree species diversity, with average accuracies of 78% for H', 77% for λ and 77% for J'. The use of DNN performed marginally better than the XGB and RF models, with accuracies of 81% for H', 80% for λ and 79% for J', respectively. Finally, a boosted regression model, involving environmental variable predictors and the DNN-based estimated tree species diversity, showed that on average 63 ± 4% of the spatial variations of tree species diversity was explained by environmental variables, including annual temperature (29.30%), followed by soil fertility (27.03%), snow cover (13.63%) and a digital elevation model (12.33%). Our results highlight that an empirical approach based on machine learning and multi-temporal Sentinel-1/2 data can adequately predict forest tree species diversity and we further show the important roles of air temperature and soil fertility in governing the spatial variability of tree species diversity in a mixed broadleaf-conifer forest setting.","",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.srs.2023.100094,"",,
rayyan-210755686,Using photographs and deep neural networks to understand flowering phenology and diversity in mountain meadows,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"ABSTRACT Mountain meadows are an essential part of the alpine-subalpine ecosystem; they provide ecosystem services like pollination and are home to diverse plant communities. Changes in climate affect meadow ecology on multiple levels, for example by altering growing season dynamics. Tracking the effects of climate change on meadow diversity through the impacts on individual species and overall growing season dynamics is critical to conservation efforts. Here, we explore how to combine crowd sourced camera images with machine learning to quantify flowering species richness across a range of elevations in alpine meadows located in Mt Rainier National Park, Washington, USA. We employed three machine learning techniques (Mask R-CNN, RetinaNet and YOLOv5) to detect wildflower species in images taken during two flowering seasons. We demonstrate that deep learning techniques can detect multiple species, providing information on flowering richness in photographed meadows. The results indicate higher richness just above the tree line for most of the species, which is comparable with patterns found using field studies. We found that the two-stage detector Mask R-CNN was more accurate than single-stage detectors like RetinaNet and YOLO, with the Mask R-CNN network performing best overall with mean average precision (mAP) of 0.67 followed by RetinaNet (0.5) and YOLO (0.4). We found that across the methods using anchor box variations in multiples of 16 led to enhanced accuracy. We also show that detection is possible even when pictures are interspersed with complex backgrounds and are not in focus. We found differential detection rates depending on species abundance, with additional challenges related to similarity in flower characteristics, labeling errors, and occlusion issues. Despite these potential biases and limitations in capturing flowering abundance and location-specific quantification, accuracy was notable considering the complexity of flower types and picture angles in this data set. We therefore expect that this approach can be used to address many ecological questions that benefit from automated flower detection, including studies of flowering phenology and floral resources, and that this approach can therefore complement a wide range of ecological approaches (e.g., field observations, experiments, community science, etc.). In all, our study suggests that ecological metrics like floral richness can be efficiently monitored by combining machine learning with easily accessible publicly curated datasets (e.g., Flickr, iNaturalist).","",https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.03.28.533305,"",,
rayyan-210755703,Insect Detect: An open-source DIY camera trap for automated insect monitoring,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract Insect monitoring is essential to design effective conservation strategies, which are indispensable to mitigate worldwide declines and biodiversity loss. For this purpose, traditional monitoring methods are widely established and can provide data with a high taxonomic resolution. However, processing of captured insect samples is often time-consuming and expensive, which limits the number of potential replicates. Automated monitoring methods can facilitate data collection at a higher spatiotemporal resolution with a comparatively lower effort and cost. Here, we present the Insect Detect DIY (do-it-yourself) camera trap for non-invasive automated monitoring of flower-visiting insects, which is based on low-cost off-the-shelf hardware components combined with open-source software. Custom trained deep learning models detect and track insects landing on an artificial flower platform in real time on-device and subsequently classify the cropped detections on a local computer. Field deployment of the solar-powered camera trap confirmed its resistance to high temperatures and humidity, which enables autonomous deployment during a whole season. On-device detection and tracking reliably estimated insect activity/abundance after metadata post-processing. Our insect classification model achieved a high top-1 accuracy on the test dataset and generalized well on a real-world dataset with captured insect images. The camera trap design and open-source software are highly customizable and can be adapted to different use cases. With custom trained detection and classification models, as well as accessible software programming, many possible applications surpassing our proposed deployment method can be realized.","",https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.12.05.570242,"",,
rayyan-210755864,Soundscape components inform acoustic index patterns and refine estimates of bird species richness,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Ecoacoustic monitoring has proliferated as autonomous recording units (ARU) have become more accessible. ARUs provide a non-invasive, passive method to assess ecosystem dynamics related to vocalizing animal behavior and human activity. With the ever-increasing volume of acoustic data, the field has grappled with summarizing ecologically meaningful patterns in recordings. Almost 70 acoustic indices have been developed that offer summarized measurements of bioacoustic activity and ecosystem conditions. However, their systematic relationships to ecologically meaningful patterns in varying sonic conditions are inconsistent and lead to non-trivial interpretations. We used an acoustic dataset of over 725,000 min of recordings across 1,195 sites in Sonoma County, California, to evaluate the relationship between 15 established acoustic indices and sonic conditions summarized using five soundscape components classified using a convolutional neural network: anthropophony (anthropogenic sounds), biophony (biotic sounds), geophony (wind and rain), quiet (lack of emergent sound), and interference (ARU feedback). We used generalized additive models to assess acoustic indices and biophony as ecoacoustic indicators of avian diversity. Models that included soundscape components explained acoustic indices with varying degrees of performance (avg. adj-R 2 = 0.61 ± 0.16; n = 1,195). For example, we found the normalized difference soundscape index was the most sensitive index to biophony while being less influenced by ambient sound. However, all indices were affected by non-biotic sound sources to varying degrees. We found that biophony and acoustic indices combined were highly predictive in modeling bird species richness (deviance = 65.8%; RMSE = 3.9 species; n = 1,185 sites) for targeted, morning-only recording periods. Our analyses demonstrate the confounding effects of non-biotic soundscape components on acoustic indices, and we recommend that applications be based on anticipated sonic environments. For instance, in the presence of extensive rain and wind, we suggest using an index minimally affected by geophony. Furthermore, we provide evidence that a measure of biodiversity (bird species richness) is related to the aggregate biotic acoustic activity (biophony). This established relationship adds to recent work that identifies biophony as a reliable and generalizable ecoacoustic measure of biodiversity.","",https://doi.org/10.3389/frsen.2023.1156837,"",,
rayyan-210755941,Plant species classification of coastal wetlands based on UAV images and object- oriented deep learning,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Aims: Under the influence of high intensity human activities, e.g.urban expansion, offshore pollutant discharge and marine resources over-exploitation, various ecological problems have been caused in recent years, especially plant species decrease, productivity decline and ecological function degradation in coastal wetland.In this context, a quick and accurate understanding of types and distribution of plant species is of great significance to coastal wetland biodiversity conservation and ecological sustainable development.Due to cloud cover in coastal zones, it is difficult to obtain effective data by using optical satellite remote-sensed images.However, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) remote sensing technology can overcome weather constraints and provide intelligent and flexible data acquisition for a feasible technique for plant species monitoring in coastal zones.Compared with pixel-based classification methods, object-oriented classification method can effectively avoid the salt-pepper phenomenon with better classification performance.However, only the low-level features are applied to the object-oriented classification method.Because of this, it is difficult to improve the classification accuracy for complex regions with many plant species.High-level classification features are used by a deep learning method to identify land cover types to achieve higher classification accuracy.In this study, combing UAV remote sensing technology and object-oriented deep learning method, plant species information of coastal wetlands was identified and classified.Methods: A representative coastal wetland area, located in Minjiang River estuary of South China, was chosen as the research site.High-resolution visible-light images of Minjiang River estuary wetland were obtained by UAV, and field sampling sites were collected by GPS.By the correction, splicing, and clipping of the UAV images, the digital orthophoto map and digital surface model were obtained.Then, on the basis of object-oriented multiresolution segmentation, the optimal segmentation scale of UAV images was determined by the scale parameter estimation model.The optimal feature combination was selected from spectral, texture, shape and height features based on separability analysis.The U-net deep learning method was used to extract the plant species information of coastal wetlands, and its classification accuracy was compared with four machine learning methods: K-nearest neighbor (KNN), decision tree (DT), random forest (RF) and Bayes.Results: Combing object-oriented method and the U-net classification method, the classification results had the better integrity with less mixing and misclassification than other classification.The object-oriented U-net method could effectively avoid the salt-pepper phenomenon with overall accuracy (OA) 95.67% and the Kappa coefficient 0.91.The OA and Kappa coefficient of each classification were in descending order: U-net > Bayes > RF > DT > KNN.There were significant differences between the producer accuracy and user accuracy of a single plant species in different classification methods.Kandelia candel, Phragmites australis and Ipomoea pescaprae had higher identification accuracy, while Scirpus mariqueter and Cyperus malaccensis had lower identification accuracy. Conclusion:The object-oriented U-net deep learning method has a favorable classification performance, and its accuracy is significantly higher than other methods in our study.The selection of optimal feature combination is the key to improving the extraction efficiency of coastal wetland plant species information.Our study could provide references for fine classification of coastal wetland plant species, as well as monitoring and biodiversity conservation management of coastal wetlands.","",https://doi.org/10.17520/biods.2022411,"",,
rayyan-210755965,Turning observations into biodiversity data: Broadscale spatial biases in community science,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract Biodiversity community science projects are growing rapidly in popularity. The enormous amounts of data generated by these programs are transforming how we conduct ecological research and conservation management. However, as with other biodiversity surveys, community science datasets suffer from biases in time and locations of observations. To better use these data, we modeled the spatial biases present in the popular community science platform, iNaturalist. iNaturalist uses crowdsourcing to collect georeferenced and time‐stamped observations of all taxa worldwide. With its wealth of biodiversity data, iNaturalist is now being used to answer a broad range of questions in ecology and conservation, but little is known about the platform's spatial biases. We focus on the more than 1.75 million iNaturalist observations available (as of December 2021) from British Columbia, Canada, a region with a strong community science presence and diversity of ecosystems. Using machine learning and species distribution modeling, we examined which landscape factors (e.g., protected areas, roads, human population density, habitat zones, elevation) were most important in determining where observations are taken, and we created a predicted probability map revealing how likely different regions are to be sampled by community scientists. We found strong road biases for observations in iNaturalist, with over 94% of observations within 1 km of roads. In addition, human population density and broad habitat ecosystem zones played a large role in predicting where iNaturalist observations occur across the landscape. These methods demonstrate tools for modeling the effects of spatial biases in large opportunistic datasets that can then be used to produce more accurate species distribution and biodiversity models from community science data.","",https://doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.4582,"",,

These methods are powerful because they can rapidly and automatically extract rich contextual and spatial information from images, a process that has historically required a large amount of human labor. A wide range of recent scientific applications have demonstrated the potential of these methods to change how researchers study the ocean. However, despite their promise, machine learning tools are still under-exploited in many domains including species and environmental monitoring, biodiversity surveys, fisheries abundance and size estimation, rare event and species detection, the study of animal behavior, and citizen science.

rayyan-210756037,Structuring Information from Plant Morphological Descriptions using Open Information Extraction,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Taxonomic literature keeps records of the planet's biodiversity and gives access to the knowledge needed for research and sustainable management. The number of publications generated is quite large: the corpus of biodiversity literature includes tens of millions of figures and taxonomic treatments. Unfortunately, most of the taxonomic descriptions are from scientific publications in text format. With more than 61 million digitized pages in the Biodiversity Heritage Library (BHL), only 467,265 taxonomic treatments are available in the Biodiversity Literature Repository. To obtain highly structured texts from digitized text has been shown to be complex and very expensive (Cui et al. 2021). The scientific community has described over 1.2 million species, but studies suggest that 86% of existing species on Earth and 91% of species in the ocean still await description (Mora et al. 2011). The published descriptions synthesize observations made by taxonomists over centuries of research and include detailed morphological aspects (i.e., shape and structure) of species useful to identify specimens, to improve information search mechanisms, to perform data analysis of species having particular characteristics, and to compare species descriptions. To take full advantage of this information and to work towards integrating it with repositories of biodiversity knowledge, the biodiversity informatics community first needs to convert plain text into a machine-processable format. More precisely, there is a need to identify structures and substructure names and the characters that describe them (Fig. 1). Open information extraction (OIE) is a research area of Natural Language Processing (NLP), which aims to automatically extract structured, machine-readable representations of data available in unstructured text; usually the result is handled as n-ary propositions, for instance, triples of the form &amp;lt;noun phrase, relation phrase, noun phrase&amp;gt; (Shen et al. 2022). OIE is continuously evolving with advancements in NLP and machine learning techniques. The state of the art in OIE involves the use of neural approaches, pre-trained language models, and integration of dependency parsing and semantic role labeling. Neural solutions mainly formulate OIE as a sequence tagging problem or a sequence generation problem. Ongoing research focuses on improving extraction accuracy; handling complex linguistic phenomena, for instance, addressing challenges like coreference resolution; and more open information extraction, because most existing neural solutions work in English texts (Zhou et al. 2022). The main objective of this project is to evaluate and compare the results of automatic data extraction from plant morphological descriptions using pre-trained language models (PLM) and a language model trained on data from plant morphological descriptions written in Spanish. The research data for this study were sourced from the species records database of the National Biodiversity Institute of Costa Rica (INBio). Specifically, the project focused on selecting records of morphological descriptions of plant species written in Spanish. The system processes the morphological descriptions using a workflow that includes phases like data selection and pre-processing, feature extraction, test PLM, local language model training, and test and evaluate results. Fig. 2 shows the general workflow used in this research. Pre-processing and Annotation: Descriptions were standardized by removing special characters like double and single quotes, replacing abbreviations, tokenizing text, and other transformations. Some records of the dataset were annotated with the ground-truth structured information in the form of triples that were extracted from each paragraph. Additionally, structured data from the project carried out by Mora and Araya (Mora and Araya 2018) were included in the dataset. Feature extraction: The token vectorization was done using word embedding directly by the language models. Test PLM: The evaluation process of PLM models used the zero-shot approach and involved applying the models to the test dataset, extracting information, and comparing it to annotated ground truth. Local Language Model Training: The annotated data was split into 80% training data and 20% test data. Using the training data, a language model based on the Transformers architecture was trained. Evaluate results: Evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 (a meaure of the model's accuracy) were calculated comparing the extracted information and the ground truth. The results were analyzed to understand the models' performance, identify strengths and weaknesses, and gain insights into their ability to extract accurate and relevant information. Based on the analysis, the evaluation process iteratively improved models results.

Migratory birds are among the most well‐studied animals on Earth, yet relatively little is known about in‐flight behaviour during nocturnal migration. Because many migrating bird species vocalize during flight, passive acoustic monitoring shows great promise for facilitating widespread monitoring of bird migration. Here, we present Nighthawk, a deep learning model designed to detect and identify the vocalizations of nocturnally migrating birds. We trained Nighthawk on the in‐flight vocalizations of migratory birds using a diverse dataset of recordings from across the Americas. Our results demonstrate that Nighthawk performs well as a nocturnal flight call detector and classifier for dozens of avian taxa, both at the species level and for broader taxonomic groups (e.g. orders and families). It achieves an average precision score above 0.80 for 50 species and a mean average precision of 0.96 across 4 orders. The model accurately quantified nightly nocturnal migration intensity (80% variation explained) and species phenology (78% variation explained) and performed well on data from across North America. Incorporating modest amounts of additional annotated audio (50–120 h) into model training yielded high performance on target datasets from both North and South America (average precision on order Passeriformes &gt;0.99). By monitoring the vocalizations of actively migrating birds, Nighthawk provides a detailed window onto nocturnal bird migration that is not presently attainable by other means (e.g. radar or citizen science). Scientists, managers and practitioners could use acoustic monitoring with Nighthawk for a number of applications, including: monitoring migration passage at wind farms; studying airspace usage during migratory flights; monitoring the changing migrations of species susceptible to climate change; and revealing previously unknown migration routes and behaviours. Overall, this work will empower diverse stakeholders to efficiently monitor migrating birds across the Western Hemisphere and collect data in aid of science and conservation.","",https://doi.org/10.1111/2041-210x.14272,"",,

The journal has grown dramatically since its inception (when it was known as the East African Wildlife Journal published up to 1978) and numerous papers have been published, some of them seminal papers shedding new light into the ecology of large savannah mammals (e.g. Caughley, 1976; East, 1984; Wyatt & Eltringham, 1974) and primates (e.g. Harcourt & Fossey, 1981; Struhsaker, 1981; Gautier-Hion, 1983). The journal's peculiarity and niche, at least at its start, were certainly due to the fact that East Africa (and the parts that had once been administered by Britain) was the original focus of the journal (published then by the East African Wildlife Society), and that was how it originally came to give so much attention to large mammals and consequently to the East African savannas. Later, the journal's niche reflected the fact that in Africa, (i) research funds provided by international bodies were primarily dedicated to the study and protection of large charismatic species – elephants, gorillas, lions and large ungulates; (ii) there is greater media interest on larger species; and (iii) the influence of the colonial legacy of what nature conservation should be (Beinart, 1989; Nelson, 2003). Many of these species also gained a much greater importance since the introduction and wide acceptance of the umbrella-species concept in contemporary conservation biology (Caro, 2003). The study of the continent's megafauna arguably then became even more solidly justified scientifically, and therefore firmly established at a global scale. Nonetheless, although it is important to pursue the study and protection of the charismatics, focussing on single-species umbrella-species under the supposition that if these are protected all others under it are secure will not ensure the longevity of co-occurring communities and will not safeguard other taxa (Roberge & Angelstam, 2004). Moreover, umbrella-species usually identified on unsound criteria often reliant on temperate-zone experiences are not easy to apply to tropical ecosystems. This is because in tropical regions ecological niches are much narrower, distribution ranges are generally smaller (e.g. Rapoport, 1982) and the ""entropy"" of the system is always much higher (Luiselli & Amori, 2022). This means that ""minor"" taxa have a disproportionate role in the functioning of tropical ecosystems compared to the temperate ones where, however, even small saproxylic beetles are crucial ecosystem engineers (Luiselli & Amori, 2022). ""Minor"" taxa are thus a priority for study given that, despite their small size, they may be as large as elephants in their ecological importance. As the AJE has expanded in recent years, it has embraced in the process many different topics, and has broadened its breadth within African ecology. Papers published in the last 2 years, for instance, have ranged from the impact of humans on wildlife (e.g. the wild meat trade in several African regions), to methodological innovations such as the use of camera trap data to determine large mammal population sizes, the effectiveness of drones or the use of convolutional neural networks to monitor aquatic megafauna. In a more classic vein, studies on the assembly of African rodent communities or even on the structure of aquatic macroinvertebrate communities have been published. There have also been some broader analyses published such as on the economic value of tropical inland freshwater habitats. As the incumbent Editor-in-Chief of the AJE, I congratulate my predecessors for editing the journal so enthusiastically, and for widening its scope and contents. It is very clear how well they have steered the journal to be a mirror of how ecological science in Africa has been flourishing as well as how it reflects the trends and tendencies in global scientific research and biological conservation. What is most rewarding to see is the increase in contributions by African scientists (that authored or co-authored almost all recent papers), contrasting with the situation 20 years ago. This result is also due to the tremendous efforts made in the past by my fellow editors and attesting the high quality reached in ecological research in Africa during recent years. A look at the articles published in AJE in the last two volumes (vol. 59 and 60, total = 211 articles) shows that, although large and medium-sized mammals are only a small fraction of African biodiversity, about 38% of the contributions were on elephants, ungulates, felids and primates. An additional 3.3% were devoted to ""mixed"" topics where still large mammals were an essential component. Instead, only 59% of the articles covered studies on all other species of animals and plants. Interestingly, only about 4% of these ""other"" articles were on insects and arthropods, even though these animals account for over 80% of all animals on the planet (Odeegard, 2000). These results demonstrate that AJE is perceived by contributors and, probably, by readers, as the platform for studies of large mammals and their role in African ecosystems. This is not necessarily a bias in the journal's interest, but a partiality generated by the unequal dedication of international donor funding of ""totemic"" species research. So, once again, AJE represents a reliable mirror of the progression of ecological science in Africa and therefore can be perceived as a powerful influencer of the field's direction and progress in the future. Given these initial soundings, I am persuaded that our journal can make a more concerted effort to encourage the publication of studies on the ecology of ""other"" African taxa. There are too many species about which we know very little, and which are worth more scientific attention. We could argue that by focusing only on a relatively small group of species we will never achieve the level of understanding needed to adequately protect the vast richness in as well as the functioning of African ecosystems – all fundamental to ensure the survival of whole landscapes. We will likewise miss out the silent loss of many taxa from the most fragile habitats and regions. The case of the Chief Goliath Beetle (Goliathus cacicus) is a formidable example of the concerns I have presented in the previous paragraphs. This beetle, up to about 9.5 cm in length, occurs throughout the Upper Guinean Forest block (Croizat, 1994; De Palma et al., 2020). This beetle is one of the largest, most beautiful and charismatic insects in Africa. It has never been the subject of any scientific study of its ecology, behaviour, habitat preferences and its distribution is not precisely known. For instance, there are old studies reporting its presence in western Nigeria (Croizat, 1994), but there are no reliable records East of Lake Volta in Ghana. In fact, most information on this species comes from international entomological market dealers in Europe and North America, or from specimen museum labels, often inaccurate and with very little detail (Morani, 2016). Even the GBIF database (available at: <Goliathus cacicus (gbif.org)>, last accessed on 24 September 2022) contains serious misidentifications, attributing some individuals of G. goliatus (from central Africa!) to G. cacicus. Based on the information available from local harvesters and exporters, we know that this giant beetle was very common in several sites in Cote d'Ivoire until the 1980s, particularly in coastal moist forests of the country. However, the Chief Goliath has been massively exploited for the International entomological market over decades (Morani, 2016), as its natural habitat (the West African moist forests) was destroyed for agriculture (especially cacao, see Rice & Greenberg, 2000; Kouassi et al., 2021) and human settlements (Mallon et al., 2015). Although threatened by exploitation and habitat loss, the Chief Goliath has never been of interest to conservation biologists and ecologists working in the field. So much so that the species has never been evaluated by the IUCN despite showing all the signs of decline. Proof of this is the fact that the Chief Goliath has apparently not been found for years in sites where it was once harvested in abundance (e.g. the Banco forest near Abidjan) and no new individuals have been exported for from January 2012 to December 2021 (https://www.facebook.com/groups/goliathus.sp/permalink/1144474852756604/). The apparent rarefaction of this species, although completely ignored by science, has gone so far that even a website specialising on the sale of beetles has published that the Chief Goliath may now even be extinct in the wild, thus creating an obvious exponential increase in price of specimens sold in recent years (http://www.collector-secret.com/insect/coleoptera/goliathus, accessed 23 September 2022). In fact, the species is certainly not extinct since in the last few years there were some observed/collected/exported individuals from a few sites in eastern Liberia and western Cote d'Ivoire (Dendi et al., 2023). However, all circumstantial evidence shows that the species is in dramatic decline, and the conclusion can only be that one of the most fascinating African beetles has been declining while completely ignored by science but noticed by beetle collectors – another classic case of ""Rome burning"" while we like Nero, fiddled. Recent face-to-face interviews with farmers, part-time hunters and forest products collectors confirm that the Chief Goliath is truly rare and probably Critically Endangered in its native range (Dendi et al., 2023). Declining trends occur in other congeneric species (Dendi et al., 2021; Muafor & LeGall, 2011) for the same reasons as the Chief Goliath; most surely the fate of many insects in different habitats and geographical regions (Davis & Philips, 2005; Wagner, 2020; Wagner et al., 2021). The consequences for the Chief Goliath, other beetles and many insects are their complete obliteration in the next few decades (Kouassi et al., 2021). Obviously, the same reasoning can apply to many other scientifically neglected Afrotropical species, including plants and vertebrates, for instance, amphibians, reptiles, small mammals, etc. But, with more dedicated science-based conservation actions adopted their fate may be reversed. Although no one knows how many invertebrates (or ""minor"" taxa) are experiencing the same fate as the Chief Goliath, I am convinced that AJE can play a crucial role in alerting and informing those in science and conservation to understand the status of species and in so doing stimulate further study and action. Because AJE is well respected within and outside Africa, studies reported in the journal will help lead conservation practice and actions. So, as the Editor-in-Chief I would like to push for the submission of papers on the ""minor taxa"" as well as on the more traditional groups. If the AJE becomes an important vehicle for scientifically strong articles that deal with the huge breadth of biodiversity in Africa, we will have fulfilled a very important mission of not just concentrating on the ""big things"" but also on those ""little things"" that in fact make the world function. I am therefore considering launching a Special Issue of the AJE that will concentrate on the ecology of African invertebrates and their conservation needs. ""Watch this space"" as they used to say in 19th century newspapers. Since its origin as a mature science, and particularly since 1960s, ecology has matured into an in-depth and rigorous science not just in terms of analyses but in the theory that underpins it. Theoretical ecology is an interdisciplinary branch in ecology, of worldwide appeal and therefore with many outlets in numerous journals, for example, Oikos, Theoretical Ecology or Journal of Theoretical Biology. The basic tenet of this branch of ecology is the study of ecological systems using theoretical methods including conceptual and mathematical models as well as computational simulations and advanced data analysis (see Jopp, 2011). George Box's famous aphorism that ""all models are wrong but some are useful"" (Box, 1979), illustrates that the use of effective models can improve our understanding of the natural world by revealing how species and populations dynamics are often based on fundamental biological principles and processes, and by unifying empirical observations under the assumption that shared mechanistic processes generate observable phenomena across species and ecological systems. Nonetheless, theoretical ecology is still at an embryonic stage in Africa, and it is generally limited to advanced data analysis of local systems without much attempt to generalise from these. AJE can contribute to improving the role of theoretical ecology in Africa by opening its doors to more papers of this ilk. To achieve this, AJE should publish studies of this type more frequently by first creating a special section focused on theoretical applications using data from African ecosystems. Papers in this new section, to be called ""In Perspective,"" will be peer-reviewed as other articles submitted to the journal. For ""Standard articles"" and ""Review articles,"" we will explicitly require that manuscripts must be clearly hypothesis-driven, to strengthen the theoretical basis of every paper. However, descriptive studies will go under the ""Short Communication"" section and will need to be condensed to be published. I strongly believe that by ensuring adequate ecological theory underpins the submitted work, African ecology will be better able to use a variety of proven methodologies (such as modelling) to forward clearer ways of understanding the variety of organisms and their interactions in the African continent. This is not to say that descriptive studies (surveys on interesting populations, species and localities) are not also central. These will continue to be published in the AJE, but with much more attention placed on the information presented, always with an eye on how such data can be generalised to other comparable scenarios and systems. If you scroll through the title of the articles published by the main journals of tropical ecology (AJE, Journal of Tropical Ecology, Biotropica) in the last 5 years, you will notice a certain disconnect between the type of articles published (mostly on natural populations without human interference) and the generality of the environmental research funds available in Africa, which often come from large companies ""exploiting the environment"" (agricultural, energy) or by conservation foundations that always require to evaluate the ""human dimension"" in the study. Especially in Africa, the ""human dimension"" is essential to understand ecological phenomenology: just think of the bushmeat ""crisis"" or the importance of community conservation in safeguarding biodiversity on a local scale. These themes have begun to be published in AJE quite regularly in recent years, but it will be my immediate goal to disseminate by AJE a greater number of analytical studies of broad interest regarding human influence and social aspects on the evolution of ecosystems and natural populations of animals and plants in Africa. Although not traditionally covered by AJE, we will also consider papers on human ecology where their effects on the African landscape, trophic chain, general ecology and biodiversity conservation are clear and of broad relevance. We will not consider purely cultural studies or cultural anthropological studies, but only those studies that consider human behaviour within the ecological context and niche theory. I understand these issues are sensitive given the dramatic history of slavery/colonisation/discrimination that African populations have had to endure for centuries. I am certainly not unaware of how European countries still tend to deny/ignore/minimise the atrocities perpetrated by their own brutal ""colonial empires"" (e.g. Ewans, 2017; Hickman, 2008; Karari, 2018). However, I believe it is essential to address the issue of human ecology in a continent under rapid economic development and so environmentally fragile. For example, it is important to analyse the effects that forest communities can have, with their lifestyle, on the habitats and density of forest species, or if there is any ""ecological"" competition for the collection and exploitation of non-timber forest resources between communities facing the same forest, and whether this competition can be sustainable or catastrophic for the persistence of the target species. Most of these aspects, although crucial for our understanding of the ecology of the African forest, have been widely ignored. In fact, academic research has traditionally been oriented either on the purely cultural aspects of the human communities in question (which do not fall within the scope of AJE) or on the simple description of conservation issues for certain species or populations, with vague references to human impact. Instead, at AJE, we seek innovative interdisciplinary contributions that examine socio-cultural, ecological, economic, demographic aspects of human populations that affect natural environments positively or negatively. In short, the keyword remains the ""ecology,"" but the ""human component"" will no longer be neglected by AJE in the years to come. Instead, the articles with a strong or even predominant human dimension component will find their place in a newly launched category of papers, the ""Interdisciplinary Perspective articles."" Regarding community conservation, for example, it is of fundamental importance to find protocols that allow the communities to assess quite objectively and easily the state of biodiversity in their areas, and the international scientific community to compare these data ""self-produced"" and ""self-managed"" by the various communities. A step in this direction has been taken by Fa et al. (2020a, 2020b), who thanks to the funds of USAID and CIFOR attempted to apply the RAPELD methodology developed by William Magnusson in Brazil (RAPELD - A brief overview. ppbio.inpa.gov.br/inicio) to forest systems in Liberia. The hope was to instal a standard methodology that can be used in many different areas in Africa. This type of innovative studies in the field of community conservation are important in the development of ecological science in Africa. I strongly encourage these types of articles to be published in AJE, as well as studies on the dynamics of the wild meat trade in relation to the social and cultural changes of the populations concerned. Preference will therefore be given to studies that advance our knowledge on a certain field rather than those that are merely confirmatory of previous studies. In conclusion, while maintaining the traditional lines that have made AJE the leading journal on African ecology, it will be my mission as the new Editor-in-Chief of the journal to broaden its scope to welcome scientific directions that can profoundly influence the development of ecology science in Africa. In other words, the AJE must increasingly become not only the platform for the publication of interesting pieces of science on the plants and animals of Africa, but the driving force to guide the development of future ecological science in Africa. In this regard, I would urge potential contributors to contact me to discuss the type of papers they would like to publish in our Journal, and especially leading authors in any sector of ecological science in Africa to suggest potential reviews and meta-analyses, scientific or controversial perspectives or other areas that are new for the AJE. As always, we value science rigour and interest for a wide readership, and in the new format for the journal we offer a suite of options (from Standard articles to Short Communications, including also In Perspective articles, Interdisciplinary Perspectives, Reviews, and the already well-launched Research Notes, Science into Practice and Technical Notes). We must make it our mission to know more about the functioning of African ecosystems both under the influence of humans as well as those that are more pristine without forgetting the many African species that are little known especially those that are under risk of extinction without anybody realising it.

rayyan-210756350,Modeling spatial distributions of Amah Mutsun priority cultural plants to support Indigenous cultural revitalization,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract Along the Central Coast of California, USA, native plant biodiversity has depended on various forms of Indigenous stewardship such as burning, tilling, and gathering. Simultaneously, the Amah Mutsun Tribal Band (the Tribe) depends on these native ecosystems for cultural survivance. However, much of the knowledge related to the location and caretaking of cultural plants has become dormant in the community due to the immediate and ongoing effects of Euro‐American colonization. We identified potential gathering areas by modeling the spatial distributions of 10 culturally important plants throughout the Tribe's stewardship area. We utilized community science datasets with an ensemble modeling approach that combines the results of five machine learning models to predict not only the distribution of each species, but also the relative certainty of those predictions spatially. Our results revealed that 265.2 km 2 (2.1%) of the Tribe's stewardship area is predicted habitat for seven or more of these cultural plants, and that the Tribe has potential access to approximately a third of these high‐priority areas. Our findings will directly inform the Tribe's cultural revitalization and ecological stewardship programs. We show how geospatial models can support the revitalization of an Indigenous culture by renewing relationships with cultural plants.","",https://doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.4374,"",,

In Amazonia, soil conditions are highly heterogeneous, which has important implications for the distribution and dynamics of the area's exceptional biodiversity. Unfortunately, available soil maps for this region suffer from inaccuracies and lack of ecologically relevant variables. Here, we develop a map of the sum of exchangeable base cation concentration (SB) in the surface soil by applying machine learning to a comprehensive set of over 10,000 field data points of SB values directly measured from soil samples or inferred using indicator plant species occurrences. As predictors, we used rasters of soil type probabilities, elevation, biomass and reflectance values from Landsat satellite images. Random Forest (RF) models were trained and tested using two different cross-validation strategies. We also assessed in which areas the map was more reliable using the area of applicability approach and compared the results with two other soil layers. The best predictors of SB variation were Landsat bands 7, 4 and 3, elevation, and probability of Histosols. The regional patterns observed across Amazonia were consistent with current geological understanding; lower SB values tended to occur in central Amazonian soils and higher values in western Amazonian soils, with considerable variation within each region. The model was found applicable over most of the Amazonian biome, especially in non-inundated (terra-firme) forest, but not over coastal areas, floodplains of major rivers and wetlands, which were poorly represented in the training data. Our new SB map over performed previous SB map and represent an accurate and ecologically meaningful variable. It is available as a digital GIS layer and can be used in habitat mapping and in modeling the current or future distributions of biological communities and species. This will advance general understanding of Amazonian biogeography and help in conservation planning.","",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.geodrs.2023.e00645,"",,
rayyan-210756570,Quantification of Microtopography in Natural Ecosystems Using Close-Range Remote Sensing,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Microtopography plays an important role in various ecological, hydrologic, and biogeochemical processes. However, quantifying the characteristics of microtopography represents a data-intensive challenge. Over the last decade, high-resolution or close-range remote sensing data and techniques have emerged as powerful tools to quantify microtopography. Traditional field surveys were mostly limited to transects or small plots, using limited sets of observations but with the decrease in the cost of close-range remote sensing technologies and the increase in computing performance, the microtopography even in forested environments can be assessed. The main objective of this article is to provide a systematic framework for microtopographic studies using close-range remote sensing technologies. This is achieved by reviewing the application of close-range remote sensing to capture microtopography and develop microtopographic models in natural ecosystems. Specifically, to achieve the main objectives, we focus on addressing the following questions: (1) What terrain attributes represent microtopography in natural ecosystems? (2) What spatial resolution of terrain attributes is needed to represent the microtopography? (3) What methodologies have been adopted to collect data at selected resolutions? (4) How to assess microtopography? Current research, challenges, and applicability of close-range remote sensing techniques in different terrains are analyzed with an eye to enhancing the use of these new technologies. We highlight the importance of using a high-resolution DEM (less than 1 m2 spatial resolution) to delineate microtopography. Such a high-resolution DEM can be generated using close-range remote sensing techniques. We also illustrate the need to move beyond elevation and include terrain attributes, such as slope, aspect, terrain wetness index, ruggedness, flow accumulation, and flow path, and assess their role in influencing biogeochemical processes such as greenhouse gas emissions, species distribution, and biodiversity. To assess microtopography in terms of physical characteristics, several methods can be adopted, such as threshold-based classification, mechanistically-based delineation, and machine learning-based delineation of microtopography. The microtopographic features can be analyzed based on physical characteristics such as area, volume, depth, and perimeter, or by using landscape metrics to compare the classified microtopographic features. Remote sensing techniques, when used in conjunction with field experiments/data, provide new avenues for researchers in understanding ecological functions such as biodiversity and species distribution, hydrological processes, greenhouse gas emissions, and the environmental factors that influence those parameters. To our knowledge, this article provides a comprehensive and detailed review of microtopography data acquisition and quantification for natural ecosystem studies.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/rs15092387,"",,
rayyan-210756628,Individual Tree Species Identification and Crown Parameters Extraction Based on Mask R-CNN: Assessing the Applicability of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Optical Images,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Automatic, efficient, and accurate individual tree species identification and crown parameters extraction is of great significance for biodiversity conservation and ecosystem function assessment. UAV multispectral data have the advantage of low cost and easy access, and hyperspectral data can finely characterize spatial and spectral features. As such, they have attracted extensive attention in the field of forest resource investigation, but their applicability for end-to-end individual tree species identification is unclear. Based on the Mask R-CNN instance segmentation model, this study utilized UAV hyperspectral images to generate spectral thinning data, spectral dimensionality reduction data, and simulated multispectral data, thereby evaluating the importance of high-resolution spectral information, the effectiveness of PCA dimensionality reduction processing of hyperspectral data, and the feasibility of multispectral data for individual tree identification. The results showed that the individual tree species identification accuracy of spectral thinning data was positively correlated with the number of bands, and full-band hyperspectral data were better than other hyperspectral thinning data and PCA dimensionality reduction data, with Precision, Recall, and F1-score of 0.785, 0.825, and 0.802, respectively. The simulated multispectral data are also effective in identifying individual tree species, among which the best result is realized through the combination of Green, Red, and NIR bands, with Precision, Recall, and F1-score of 0.797, 0.836, and 0.814, respectively. Furthermore, by using Green–Red–NIR data as input, the tree crown area and width are predicted with an RMSE of 3.16m2 and 0.51m, respectively, along with an rRMSE of 0.26 and 0.12. This study indicates that the Mask R-CNN model with UAV optical images is a novel solution for identifying individual tree species and extracting crown parameters, which can provide practical technical support for sustainable forest management and ecological diversity monitoring.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/rs15215164,"",,
rayyan-210756670,Global birdsong embeddings enable superior transfer learning for bioacoustic classification,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Automated bioacoustic analysis aids understanding and protection of both marine and terrestrial animals and their habitats across extensive spatiotemporal scales, and typically involves analyzing vast collections of acoustic data. With the advent of deep learning models, classification of important signals from these datasets has markedly improved. These models power critical data analyses for research and decision-making in biodiversity monitoring, animal behaviour studies, and natural resource management. However, deep learning models are often data-hungry and require a significant amount of labeled training data to perform well. While sufficient training data is available for certain taxonomic groups (e.g., common bird species), many classes (such as rare and endangered species, many non-bird taxa, and call-type) lack enough data to train a robust model from scratch. This study investigates the utility of feature embeddings extracted from audio classification models to identify bioacoustic classes other than the ones these models were originally trained on. We evaluate models on diverse datasets, including different bird calls and dialect types, bat calls, marine mammals calls, and amphibians calls. The embeddings extracted from the models trained on bird vocalization data consistently allowed higher quality classification than the embeddings trained on general audio datasets. The results of this study indicate that high-quality feature embeddings from large-scale acoustic bird classifiers can be harnessed for few-shot transfer learning, enabling the learning of new classes from a limited quantity of training data. Our findings reveal the potential for efficient analyses of novel bioacoustic tasks, even in scenarios where available training data is limited to a few samples.","",https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2307.06292,"",,
rayyan-210756677,Space technology: A powerful tool for safeguarding world heritage,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"The Convention Concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage (WHC), adopted by United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) on November 16, 1972, aims to ensure the identification, protection, conservation, presentation, and transmission to future generations of the world's cultural and natural heritage. The WHC works toward these goals by emphasizing the Outstanding Universal Value (OUV) of heritage sites and the unique contribution such places can make to conservation and human development agendas.1UNESCO, United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization. Operational Guidelines for the Implementation of the World Heritage Convention. Paris, France: UNESCO, 2021.Google Scholar As of the end of January 2023, the WHC has been signed by 194 state parties, covering 1,157 sites (including 900 cultural, 218 natural, and 39 mixed properties), 55 of which are considered to be in danger. These sites, totaling an area of more than 370 million hectares are designated as World Heritage (WH) sites (https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/). WH sites have played a significant role in the sustainable development of society globally and helped effectively maintain and preserve the cultural diversity and global biodiversity of the Earth.2Luo L. Wang X. Guo H. Contribution of UNESCO designated sites to the achievement of sustainable development goals.Innovation. 2022; 3100227Google Scholar However, WH sites around the world are experiencing significant impacts caused, in large part, by increasing anthropogenic threats (such as the rapid spread of urban sprawl, deforestation, resource overexploitation, air pollution, armed conflict, excessive tourism, and poor management).3Allan J.R. Venter O. Maxwell S. et al.Recent increases in human pressure and forest loss threaten many Natural World Heritage Sites.Biol. Conserv. 2017; 206: 47-55Crossref Scopus (104) Google Scholar There is also a range of overarching, long-term global challenges posed by climate change, extreme and severe weather events and geological hazards.4Vousdoukas M.I. Clarke J. Ranasinghe R. et al.African heritage sites threatened as sea-level rise accelerates.Nat. Clim. Chang. 2022; 12: 256-262Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar These threats, anthropogenic or otherwise, have put an unprecedented amount of pressure on the protection of both cultural and natural properties at the heritage sites. There is no conclusive solution to effectively protect heritage sties in the foreseeable future, and the public is becoming increasingly conscious about the negative impacts some anthropogenic activities have brought to heritage sites, exposing them to various risks for irreversible damage and loss. In light of this predicament, UNESCO, alongside its conservation partners, has been actively calling for the use of non-intrusive space technology (ST) to better evaluate and understand the detrimental factors surrounding WH sites and devise effective plans to mitigate negative impacts on OUV through the accurate identification, documentation, monitoring, and understanding of WH sites and their changes across large spatiotemporal scales. For this commentary, ST refers mainly to remote sensing (RS) based on Earth observation (EO) from space, as well as other geospatial information technologies such as geographic information systems (GIS) and global navigation satellite systems (GNSS). Even though ST was not developed intentionally for WH protection, it provides an advanced set of innovative and flexible tools that integrate scientific research into heritage science, which forms the evidential base to support measures for the protection of WH sites. ST also opens up paths of methodological innovation to facilitate future conservation of cultural and natural properties with new paradigms. On the basis of a half-century review of the applications of ST in the field of WH, we find that ST has effectively reshaped our means for WH conservation in four major domains of application: mapping, monitoring, modeling, and management of WH sites (Figure 1A). ST, as an objective and reliable ""eye"" from above for heritage experts, has enabled detailed mapping of heritages at various scales. This application commonly involves the acquisition and updatable analysis of multimodal datasets, combined with near real-time survey and investigation of WH sites and their contextual environments. ST is also an invaluable tool in identifying and designating potential new WH sites. The widespread integration of ST has played a crucial role in UNESCO's routine monitoring and emergency monitoring of cultural and natural heritages as a countermeasure to the challenges presented by global change. In particular, ST has made major contributions to fine-grained monitoring at very high resolutions in time and space and in assessing change caused by natural and/or anthropogenic processes. The combined application of RS, GIS, and augmented reality has facilitated the production of three-dimensional (3D) modeling of WH sites. In addition, photogrammetry and laser scanning can be used in WH surveys for generating 3D documentation of cultural and natural properties. Heritage information models of some popular WH sites have already been actively used in the fields of architecture study and digital ecology. The ability of ST to contribute to the conservation, planning, and management of WH sites has already been commonly used in the following domains: the definition of authenticity and integrity (AI), the mapping of OUV attributes of cultural and natural assets, the development and maintenance of heritage databases, 3D modeling and digital reconstruction, and informing WH management for sustainable development. The UNESCO WHC refers to its ""strategic objectives"" as the ""5 C's"": credibility, conservation, capacity building, communication, and communities.1UNESCO, United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization. Operational Guidelines for the Implementation of the World Heritage Convention. Paris, France: UNESCO, 2021.Google Scholar Here, we propose five key contributions (""5 D's"") of ST for conservation work involving WH sites (see Figure 1B): data, driver, discovery, digital transformation, and decision support. ST and the 5 D's, together with the WHC, constitute the ""turbine model"" for safeguarding WH that is proposed in this commentary and will assist in achieving the 5 C's over the next 50 years. By providing massive multi-source data, ST plays a crucial role in the WH governance chain. Archived data together with ongoing data acquisition record changes at WH sites and provide evidence for their conservation. The data collected through ST will, in turn, serve as an invaluable store of not only raw observations but also derivative products that can be extracted from imagery.5Levin N. Ali S. Crandall D. et al.World Heritage in danger: big data and remote sensing can help protect sites in conflict zones.Global Environ. Change. 2019; 55: 97-104Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar As a result of this data mechanism, ST will be able to mitigate the problem of lacunae in WH data by offering global coverage and consistency. ST is driving a revolution to become a new paradigm of WH protection. It provides advanced tools, such as RS data processing and GIS spatial analysis powered by machine learning, which can be used for dynamic monitoring and spatiotemporal analysis of changes that are occurring at WH sites. From this enhanced monitoring method, WH specialists and managers are empowered with the tools to monitor change over time and to assess whether conservation efforts to mitigate the impacts of natural and anthropogenic processes are contributing to positive outcomes toward sustainability. ST plays a key role in aiding frontier research across multiple disciplines related to heritage science. Scientific discoveries based on the use of new geospatial technologies and big EO data can be applied to the quantitative assessment of the state of WH protection. They can also be used to support deepened multidimensional interpretations of the OUV of WH sites, to guide the sustainable use of WH, and to improve accessibility so that all stakeholders may obtain unbiased and open information, thus increasing the credibility of WH as a global brand. ST provides a means of digital transformation that can be used for identifying, understanding, visualizing, presenting, and interpreting WH sites and their OUV in the digital space. In the future, ST will promote the transformation of WH protection through studies such as tangible heritage, digitalized heritage, or both. GIS-aided digital transformation will greatly improve the quality and efficiency of global communication and the dissemination of information related to WH sites, promoting public awareness of protection concepts and smoothing the implementation of actions. ST is becoming an invaluable tool to provide decision-making support along the entire chain of WH governance, from mapping to monitoring, modeling, and management. ST-based solutions could offer spatial intelligence to inform strategic decision making for multiple stakeholders, including local communities, WH sectors, institutions, and organizations. It offers an innovative path for capacity building and capacity enhancement in relation to the global governance of WH. These solutions are delivered in numerous ways, including databases, technologies, protocols, visualization platforms, and analytical systems. WH is under the influence of a wide array of anthropogenic and natural processes, giving the heritage bodies and national and international organizations promoting the preservation of WH sites an unprecedented opportunity to use science, technology, and innovation, including ST, to experiment innovative solutions and promote the role of WH in achieving sustainable development. Given that natural and anthropogenic challenges can present similar issues in various regions across the globe, it is evident that sharing knowledge and expertise, as well as developing collective strategies to leverage ST, while tailoring our methods to local circumstances, will be fundamental in developing a global approach for WH that is successful in the long run. The past 50 years of applications have resulted in continuous innovation in the development of ST to become powerful, cutting-edge tools for use in heritage documentation, monitoring, assessment and protection, and sustainable development. Although the progress is promising, we must underscore that relying solely on ST is insufficient; the greatest benefits are achieved by integrating ST with a variety of disciplines, such as management, economics, sustainability, sociology, education, ethics, politics, law, art, and aesthetics. Through closer and sustained engagement with a broader cross-section of society and local communities, ST can contribute to opening new horizons for WH protection over the course of the twenty-first century.

While our understanding of biodiversity worldwide is not yet comprehensive, it is crucial to explore effective means of characterizing it in order to mitigate these impacts. The advancements in data storage, exchange capabilities, and the increasing availability of extensive taxonomic, ecological, and environmental databases offer possibilities for implementing new approaches that can address knowledge gaps regarding species and habitats. This enhanced knowledge will, in turn, facilitate improved management practices and enable better local governance of territories. Meeting these requirements necessitates the development of innovative tools and methods to respond to these needs. Citizen science platforms have emerged as valuable resources for generating large amounts of biodiversity data, thanks to their visibility and attractiveness to individuals involved in territorial management and education. These platforms present new opportunities to train deep learning models for automated species recognition, leveraging the substantial volumes of multimedia data they accumulate. However, effectively managing, curating, and disseminating the data and services generated by these platforms remains a significant challenge that hinders the achievement of their objectives. In line with this, the GUARDEN and MAMBO European projects aim to utilize the Pl@ntNet participatory science platform (Affouard et al. 2021) to develop and implement novel computational services to enable the widespread creation of floristic inventories. In the pursuit of this project, various standards and reference datasets have been employed, such as the POWO (Plants of the World Online) world checklist and the WGSRPD (World Geographical Scheme for Recording Plant Distributions) standard, to establish a foundation for creating a global service that aids in plant identification through visual analysis. This service relies on a NoSQL (Not Only Structured Query Language) data management system ArangoDB (Arango Database), utilizes state-of-the-art automated visual classification models (vision transformers), and operates on a distributed IT (Information Technology) infrastructure that leverages the capabilities of collaborative stakeholders interested in supporting this initiative. Global-scale automated workflows have been established specifically for the collection, analysis, and dissemination of illustrated occurrences of plant species. These workflows now enable the development of new IT tools that facilitate the description and monitoring of species and habitat conservation statuses. A comprehensive presentation highlighting the significant advancements achieved will be provided to share the lessons learned during its development and ensure the widespread adoption of this service within the scientific community.","",https://doi.org/10.3897/biss.7.112545,"",,

Shifts in phenology have important implications for trophic interactions, ecosystem functioning and community ecology. However, data on plant phenology can be time consuming to collect and current records are biased across space and taxonomy. Here, we explore the performance of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for classifying flowering phenology on a very large and taxonomically diverse dataset of citizen science images. We analyse &gt;1.8 million iNaturalist records for plants listed in the National Botanical Gardens within South Africa, a country famed for its floristic diversity (∼21,000 species) but poorly represented in phenological databases. We were able to correctly classify images with &gt;90% accuracy. Using metadata associated with each image, we then reconstructed the timing of peak flower production and length of the flowering season for the 6,986 species with &gt;5 iNaturalist records. Our analysis illustrates how machine learning tools can leverage the vast wealth of citizen science biodiversity data to describe large-scale phenological dynamics. We suggest such approaches may be particularly valuable where data on plant phenology is currently lacking.","",https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.12.21.572952,"",,

Despite the progress in species distribution modeling (SDM) over the past decades, SDM have just begun to integrate high resolution remote sensing data and their predictions are still entailed by many biases due to heterogeneity of the available biodiversity observations, most often opportunistic presence only data. We designed a European scale dataset covering around ten thousand plant species to calibrate and evaluate SDM predictions of species composition in space and time at high spatial resolution (~ten meters), and their spatial transferability. For model training, we extracted and harmonized five million heterogeneous presence-only records from selected GBIF datasets and 6 thousand exhaustive presence-absence surveys both sampled during 2017-2021. We associated species observations to diverse environmental rasters classically used in SDMs, as well as to 10 m resolution RGB and Near-Infra-Red satellite images and 20 years-time series of climatic variables and satellite point values. The evaluation dataset is based on 22 thousand standardized presence-absence surveys separated from the training set with a spatial block hold out procedure. The GeoLifeCLEF 2023 dataset is open access and the first benchmark for researchers aiming to improve the prediction of plant species composition at a very fine spatial grain and at continental scale. It is a space to explore new ways of combining massive and diverse species observations and environmental information at various scales. Innovative AI-based approaches, in particular, should be among the most interesting methods to experiment with on the GeoLifeCLEF 2023 dataset.","",https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2308.05121,"",,
rayyan-210756983,Comparative Study: Evaluating the effects of class balancing on transformer performance in the PlantNet-300k image dataset,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Image-based identification of plant specimens plays a crucial role in various fields such as agriculture, ecology, and biodiversity conservation. The growing interest in deep learning has led to remarkable advancements in image classification techniques, particularly with the utilization of convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Since 2015, in the context of the PlantCLEF (Conference and Labs of the Evaluation Forum) challenge (Joly et al. 2015), deep learning models, specifically CNNs, have consistently achieved the most impressive results in this field (Carranza-Rojas 2018). However, recent developments have introduced transformer-based models, such as ViT (Vision Transformer) (Dosovitskiy et al. 2020) and CvT (Convolutional vision Transformer) (Wu et al. 2021), as a promising alternative for image classification tasks. Transformers offer unique advantages such as capturing global context and handling long-range dependencies (Vaswani et al. 2017), which make them suitable for complex recognition tasks like plant identification. In this study, we focus on the image classification task using the PlantNet-300k dataset (Garcin et al. 2021a). The dataset consists of a large collection of 306,146 plant images representing 1,081 distinct species. These images were selected from the Pl@ntNet citizen observatory database. The dataset has two prominent characteristics that pose challenges for classification. First, there is a significant class imbalance, meaning that a small subset of species dominates the majority of the images. This imbalance creates bias and affects the accuracy of classification models. Second, many species exhibit visual similarities, making it tough, even for experts, to accurately identify them. These characteristics are referred to by the dataset authors as long-tailed distribution and high intrinsic ambiguity, respectively (Garcin et al. 2021b). In order to address the inherent challenges of the PlantNet-300k dataset, we employed a two-fold approach. Firstly, we leveraged transformer-based models to tackle the dataset's intrinsic ambiguity and effectively capture the complex visual patterns present in plant images. Secondly, we focused on mitigating the class imbalance issue through various data preprocessing techniques, specifically class balancing methods. By implementing these techniques, we aimed to ensure fair representation of all plant species in order to improve the overall performance of image classification models. Our objective is to assess the effects of data preprocessing techniques, specifically class balancing, on the classification performance of the PlantNet-300k dataset. By exploring different preprocessing methods, we addressed the class imbalance issue and through precise evaluation, conducted a comparison of the performance of transformer-based models with and without class balancing techniques. Through these efforts, our ultimate goal is to assert if these techniques allow us to achieve more accurate and reliable classification results, particularly for underrepresented species in the dataset. In our experiment, we compared the performance of two transformer-based models, ViT and CvT, using two versions of the PlantNet-300k dataset: one with class balancing and the other without class balancing. This setup results in a total of four sets of metrics for evaluation. To assess the classification performance, we utilized a wide range of commonly used metrics including recall, precision, accuracy, AUC (Area Under the Curve), ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic), and others. These metrics provide insights into each models' ability to correctly classify plant species, identify false positives and negatives, measure overall accuracy, and assess the models' discriminatory power. By conducting this comparative study, we seek to contribute to the advancement of plant identification research by providing empirical evidence of the benefits and effectiveness of class balancing techniques in improving the performance of transformer-based models on the PlantNet-300k dataset and any other similar ones.","",https://doi.org/10.3897/biss.7.113057,"",,
rayyan-210757031,From simple labels to semantic image segmentation: Leveraging citizen science plant photographs for tree species mapping in drone imagery,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract. Knowledge of plant species distributions is essential for various applications, such as nature conservation, agriculture, and forestry. Remote sensing data, especially high-resolution orthoimages from Unoccupied Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), were demonstrated to be an effective data source for plant species mapping. Particularly, in concert with novel pattern recognition methods, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), plant species can be accurately segmented in such high-resolution UAV images. Training such pattern recognition models for species segmentation that are transferable across various landscapes and remote sensing data characteristics often requires excessive training data. Training data are usually derived in the form of segmentation masks from field surveys or visual interpretation of the target species in remote sensing images. Still, both methods are laborious and constrain the training of transferable pattern recognition models. Alternatively, pattern recognition models could be trained on the open knowledge of how plants look as available from smartphone-based species identification apps, that is, millions of citizen science-based smartphone photographs and the corresponding species label. However, these pairs of citizen science-based photographs and simple species labels (one label for the entire image) cannot be used directly for training state-of-the-art segmentation models used for UAV image analysis, which require per-pixel labels for training (also called masks). Here, we overcome the limitation of simple labels of citizen science plant observations with a two-step approach: In the first step, we train CNN-based image classification models using the simple labels and apply them in a moving-window approach over UAV orthoimagery to create segmentation masks. In the second phase, these segmentation masks are used to train state-of-the-art CNN-based image segmentation models with an encoder-decoder structure. We tested the approach on UAV orthoimages acquired in summer and autumn on a test site comprising ten temperate deciduous tree species in varying mixtures. Several tree species could be mapped with surprising accuracy (mean F1-score = 0.47). In homogenous species assemblages, the accuracy increased considerably (mean F1-score 0.55). The results indicate that many tree species can be mapped without generating training data and by integrating pre-existing knowledge from citizen science. Moreover, our analysis revealed that citizen science photographs’ variability in acquisition data and context facilitates the generation of models that are transferable through the vegetation season. Thus, citizen science data may greatly advance our capacity to monitor hundreds of plant species and, thus, Earth's biodiversity across space and time.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-2576,"",,
rayyan-210757165,New deep learning-based methods for visualizing ecosystem properties using environmental DNA metabarcoding data,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"1. Metabarcoding of environmental DNA (eDNA) has recently improved our understanding of biodiversity patterns in marine and terrestrial ecosystems. However, the complexity of these data prevents current methods to extract and analyze all the relevant ecological information they contain. Therefore, ecological modeling could greatly benefit from new methods providing better dimensionality reduction and clustering. 2. Here we present two new deep learning-based methods that combine different types of neural networks to ordinate eDNA samples and visualize ecosystem properties in a two-dimensional space: the first is based on variational autoencoders (VAEs) and the second on deep metric learning (DML). The strength of our new methods lies in the combination of several inputs: the number of sequences found for each molecular operational taxonomic unit (MOTU), together with the genetic sequence information of each detected MOTU within an eDNA sample. 3. Using three different datasets, we show that our methods represent well three different ecological indicators in a two-dimensional latent space: MOTU richness per sample, sequence α-diversity per sample, and sequence ꞵ-diversity between samples. We show that our nonlinear methods are better at extracting features from eDNA datasets while avoiding the major biases associated with eDNA. Our methods outperform traditional dimension reduction methods such as Principal Component Analysis, t-distributed Stochastic Neighbour Embedding, and Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection for dimension reduction. 4. Our results suggest that neural networks provide a more efficient way of extracting structure from eDNA metabarcoding data, thereby improving their ecological interpretation and thus biodiversity monitoring.","",https://doi.org/10.22541/au.168156381.10025189/v1,"",,
rayyan-210757177,Mapping and analyzing the spatial drivers of Chinese subtropical forests features from Gaofen 1 satellite imagery,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract Understanding the spatial variations of forest features and their underlying drivers is crucial for managing and preserving forest ecosystems. Remote sensing techniques, due to their vast spatial coverage, are proving an essential tool for mapping and analyzing the complex spatial patterns of forests characteristics. In the current study, we use high-resolution Gaofen 1 satellite imagery to map features, such as biomass, biodiversity, and habitat type, of the subtropical forests in the Nanling area, a major biodiversity hot spot in the south of China; for subsequently analyzing the association between forest features and environmental drivers. We based our modeling approach on a semi-supervised fully convolutional neural network consisting of a ResNet architecture and a masking and aggregation module for computing predictions for forest survey plots of varied sizes. The fitted convolutional models yielded very high performance statistics, with test R2 values above 0.90 for basal area, aboveground biomass and Shannon diversity index regressions, slightly lower values for the regression of species richness (R2=0.83), and average test classification accuracy of forest types of 0.89, with lower performance for infrequent forest types, such as dwarf forests. The association analysis between predicted maps of forest features and environmental drivers revealed significant correlations being the strongest drivers the altitude, nitrogen content and climate variables, such as mean annual precipitation and temperature. Altitude was strongly associated with dwarf forests and high basal area and high aboveground biomass locations. Basal area and aboveground biomass were also positively influenced by annual rainfall and soil nitrogen and carbon, and negatively by temperature and radiation variables. Species richness was associated with high nitrogen and carbon contents, while the Shannon diversity index showed overall mild correlations with most drivers, with no remarkable patterns. We concluded that our semi-supervised convolutional approach using Gaofen 1 imagery proved useful for modeling the spatial distribution of the subtropical forests in Nanling; however, more research and data collection is necessary to improve the performance of species richness modeling and segmentation of infrequent forest types. Moreover, the strong associations found between climate, and predicted maps of biomass and forest types, provided key insights into the potential repercussions of climate change on Nanling forests.","",https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-3685695/v1,"",,
rayyan-210757188,Drivers of Mangrove Vulnerability and Resilience to Tropical Cyclones in the North Atlantic Basin,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"The North Atlantic Basin (NAB) is seeing an increase in the frequency and intensity of tropical cyclones since the 1980s, with record-breaking seasons such as 2017 and 2020. However, little is known about how coastal ecosystems, particularly mangroves in the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean, are responding to these new “climate normals” at regional and subregional scales. Wind speed, rainfall, forest structure, and hydro-geomorphology are known to influence mangrove damage and recovery following cyclones in the NAB. However, previous studies have focused on local-scale responses and individual cyclonic events. Here, we analyze 25 years (1996-2020) of mangrove vulnerability (damage after a cyclone) and 24 years (1996-2019) of short-term resilience (recovery after damage) for the NAB and subregions, using multi-annual, remote sensing-derived databases. We applied machine learning to characterize the influence of 22 potential variables on mangrove responses, including previously researched and new ones such as human development and long-term climate trends. Rates and drivers of mangrove vulnerability and resilience vary across NAB subregions, and hotspots of cyclone impact, mangrove damage, and loss of resilience are presented in this study. Cyclones characteristics mainly drive vulnerability at the regional level, while resilience is driven by site-specific conditions. These include long-term climate trends, pre-cyclone habitat structure, soil organic carbon stock, and human interventions on the land. We highlight that loss of resilience occurs mostly in areas undergoing long-term drought across the NAB, and coastal development influences both vulnerability and resilience at the subregional level. Thus, the impacts of increasing cyclone activity on mangroves and their ecosystem services such as coastal protection need to be framed in the context of climate change compound effects and heavy human influences in the region. There is an urgent need to value the restoration and conservation of NAB mangroves as fundamental Nature-based Solutions against cyclone hazards.","",https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4381378,"",,
rayyan-210757490,<i>Nighthawk</i>: acoustic monitoring of nocturnal bird migration in the Americas,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract Animal migration is one of nature’s most spectacular phenomena, but migratory animals and their journeys are imperiled across the globe. Migratory birds are among the most well-studied animals on Earth, yet relatively little is known about in-flight behavior during nocturnal migration. Because many migrating bird species vocalize during flight, passive acoustic monitoring shows great promise for facilitating widespread monitoring of bird migration. Here, we present Nighthawk, a deep learning model designed to detect and identify the vocalizations of nocturnally migrating birds. We trained Nighthawk on the in-flight vocalizations of migratory birds using a diverse dataset of recordings from across the Americas. Our results demonstrate that Nighthawk performs well as a nocturnal flight call detector and classifier for dozens of avian taxa, both at the species level and for broader taxonomic groups (e.g., orders and families). The model accurately quantified nightly nocturnal migration intensity and species phenology and performed well on data from across North America. Incorporating modest amounts of additional annotated audio (50-120 h) into model training yielded high performance on target datasets from both North and South America. By monitoring the vocalizations of actively migrating birds, Nighthawk provides a detailed window onto nocturnal bird migration that is not presently attainable by other means (e.g., radar or citizen science). Scientists, managers, and practitioners could use acoustic monitoring with Nighthawk for a number of applications, including: monitoring migration passage at wind farms; studying airspace usage during migratory flights; monitoring the changing migrations of species susceptible to climate change; and revealing previously unknown migration routes and behaviors. Overall, this work will empower diverse stakeholders to efficiently monitor migrating birds across the Western Hemisphere and collect data in aid of science and conservation.

rayyan-210757763,Exploring the potential of plastid biology and biotechnology,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Plastids are a family of organelles that likely originate from the endosymbiosis of cyanobacteria (Howe et al., 2008) and exhibit diverse morphologies and biochemical capabilities (Fig. 1). The chloroplast is the most well-studied plastid type and performs photosynthesis in plants and algae and is thus responsible for most of the food production on the planet. However, there are other important biochemical functions performed by plastids, including the synthesis and storage of some carbohydrates, pigment production, fatty acid synthesis and nitrogen and sulphur assimilation. Plants have specialised plastid types that carry out some of these functions, such as starch-storing amyloplasts and pigment-producing chromoplasts (Fig. 1). The annual Plastid Preview Meeting took place on 1–2 September 2022 in Norwich (UK), jointly hosted by the John Innes Centre and the University of East Anglia. Since the 1970s, Plastid Preview has showcased cutting-edge research from PhD students and early career postdoctoral scientists investigating fundamental and applied plastid biology. Research presented throughout the years has not only addressed questions in photosynthesis but also in diverse areas such as chlorophyll biosynthesis, starch metabolism, carbon fixation, plastid gene expression and plastid transformation. In the 2022 meeting, it was apparent that significant progress is being made in addressing long-standing questions in these areas with the aid of technological developments, such as machine learning, gene editing and cryo-EM approaches to study protein structure, combined with the ability to explore previously untapped biological diversity with the rapid expansion of genome sequences. Three major domains of plastid research were covered: the first concerned 'understanding the plastid', probing the fundamental mechanisms that govern plastid biology. The second concerned 'optimising the plastid' and focussed on processes that could increase productivity and resilience in cyanobacteria, algae and plants. The third concerned 'utilising the plastid', specifically the use of plastid-containing organisms in biotechnology to produce high-value proteins and metabolites. Here, we highlight some of the diverse and exciting areas of work encompassing these three domains that were covered at the meeting. Research into fundamental plastid processes, such as biogenesis, gene expression, protein import and division, is required to understand how photosynthesis and metabolism occur and are integrated within the organelle. Protein import is a prime example of a process that influences many other plastid functions and was an area of active discussion at the meeting. The majority of the plastid proteome is encoded in the nucleus, and proteins are imported into the organelle through recognition of plastid-localisation signals, translocation through the plastid membranes and delivery to the appropriate location within the plastid. This process heavily influences the plastid proteome and thus plastid function, and recent exciting work implicated ubiquitination in this process (Ling & Jarvis, 2015). Ling et al. (2012) discovered that the cytosolic ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation pathway regulates components of the protein import machinery. More recently, ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation has also been observed for a broad range of chloroplast proteins in Arabidopsis, including those involved in photosynthesis, oxidative stress and other metabolic pathways (Sun et al., 2022). This opens new and exciting questions about the role of ubiquitination in the regulation of these processes, as well as its relevance to a broader range of species and plastid types, including crops. We also discussed the exciting links that were emerging between fundamental plastid processes, such as between protein import and plastid division (Fang et al., 2022). While protein import is an example of how the nucleus can influence plastid function, the plastid possesses reciprocal mechanisms to signal its status back to the nucleus, known as retrograde signalling. Many aspects of this communication are not fully understood, but several important components have been uncovered, such as tetrapyrroles and reactive oxygen species (Chan et al., 2016). Many of these components accumulate due to a defect in photosynthesis, allowing the nucleus to sense the status of the chloroplast. Since photosynthesis is sensitive to perturbations in environmental conditions, this makes the chloroplast an ideal sentinel for general cell status. As such, retrograde signalling is involved in the response to both abiotic and biotic stresses (Chan et al., 2016; Littlejohn et al., 2021). An example of emerging research discussed at the meeting is how pathogen infection can affect nuclear expression of genes encoding plastid-localised proteins that influence resistance (Corredor-Moreno et al., 2022). Uncovering how pathogen effectors hijack plastid metabolism during infection and the broader roles of the plastid in biotic interactions could lead to novel approaches to protect plants from pathogens. Photosynthesis is a central role of chloroplasts and is the main source of energy in cyanobacteria. The inefficiencies of RuBisCo have been described in detail (Flamholz et al., 2019). It can be partly attributed to the slow evolution of the enzyme (Bouvier et al., 2022) and the requirement to balance carboxylation rates with CO2/O2 specificity. The meeting highlighted exciting strategies to overcome these and increase RuBisCo activity. The first strategy was based on harnessing pre-existing diversity in RuBisCo. There is large variation in RuBisCo kinetics between phototrophs (Savir et al., 2010) that could potentially be exploited to replace native enzymes with more efficient versions, if localised CO2 concentrations could be increased. Extensive modelling shows that replacing the wheat RuBisCo with that from a C4 species could significantly increase the efficiency of carbon uptake (Iqbal et al., 2021), and experimentally implementing these predictions may validate this route to increasing photosynthetic efficiency. Furthermore, there are many species where RuBisCo kinetics have not been reported, particularly in nonmodel species. As machine learning becomes increasingly prevalent, it may be employed to predict RuBisCo sequences with the potential to improve photosynthesis. The second strategy is to improve RuBisCo efficiency via carbon concentrating mechanisms (CCMs). CCMs can be biophysical, like algal pyrenoids and cyanobacterial carboxysomes, or biochemical, as in C4 plants. Recent work has focussed on developing a mechanistic understanding on how these CCMs form and function. One breakthrough was the discovery of the Chlamydomonas reinhardtii protein EPYC1, which physically links RuBisCo to the pyrenoid (Mackinder et al., 2016). This not only enhanced our understanding of pyrenoid assembly but also opened the possibility of engineering pyrenoids into plants (Adler et al., 2022). Similar work to transfer carboxysomes of cyanobacteria into plants may follow, benefitting from recent insights into the structure of the α-carboxysome (Ni et al., 2022). Beyond photosynthesis in chloroplasts, there are many metabolic pathways that could be manipulated to increase crop quality, from carotenoid storage in chromoplasts to fatty acid synthesis in elaioplasts (Fig. 1). Specifically, exciting progress has been made on starch synthesis in amyloplasts of wheat, which produce two distinct types of starch granules, large A-type and small B-type granules. The discovery that the protein MRC regulates the formation of B-type granules can be exploited to introduce desirable changes in starch granule size properties for the food and milling industries (Chen et al., 2022). Further understanding of these processes may come from exploiting intra- and interspecies diversity and will drive improvements in crop nutritional and functional quality in a similar way to improvements in photosynthesis. Biotechnological approaches to using the plastid as a biofactory have been a key theme of recent Plastid Preview meetings. The plastid provides a distinct environment from the rest of the cell for producing valuable proteins and metabolites. Much attention has fallen on cyanobacteria and algae, especially newly discovered fast-growing species like Synechococcus sp. PCC 11901 (Włodarczyk et al., 2020), for which large volumes of cells can be cultivated with ease and in a smaller space compared with plants. There are numerous examples of C. reinhardtii chloroplast engineering to produce vaccine subunits, antibacterial compounds and antibodies (Dyo & Purton, 2018). A primary focus of this meeting was to explore new techniques and approaches to improve cyanobacterial, algal and plant biotechnology. Regulators of chloroplast transgenes are of great interest, to allow robust control and easy on/off switching of expression. Riboswitches, for instance the thiamine pyrophosphate riboswitch, are a potential solution (Mehrshahi et al., 2020), and the discovery of further novel switches and using these in tandem can expand our existing toolkit. Another area highlighted was targeting heterologous proteins to distinct plastid subcompartments, like the chloroplast thylakoid lumen. This would expand the range of proteins that can be produced to those that are not stable in the stroma (Chin-Fatt & Menassa, 2021). To ensure that such exciting biotechnological approaches can be realised, a key priority is to expand our toolkit of plastid transformation technologies. This includes improved synthetic biology tools, for example, MoClo cloning systems that are compatible across a range of phototrophs (Vasudevan et al., 2019). We expect that progress will come from developing novel Cas enzymes, beyond Cas9, for efficient function in the plastid and adapting base editing technology for efficient plastome editing. An additional challenge when engineering organisms with multiple plastids per cell is achieving homoplasmy, and exciting new techniques are emerging to overcome this (Okuzaki et al., 2020). These methods could result in the widespread adoption of plastid transformation and utilisation of plastids as biofactories in cyanobacteria, algae and plants. The Plastid Preview Meeting remains guided by its fundamental goal of shining a light on plastid function, both in photosynthesis and beyond. This meeting highlighted diversity in the plastid field – from the variety of plastid types studied, to intra- and interspecies differences in mechanisms of plastid function. However, much natural diversity remains unexplored and technologies continue to evolve, particularly through adopting and combining techniques from different fields. Exploiting these will be essential to understand, improve and utilise the plastid further, and we have no doubt that this will be covered at future Plastid Previews. We thank all presenters and attendees of the Plastid Preview Meeting 2022, and we apologise to those whose research area could not be discussed here due to space restrictions.

rayyan-210757776,Genome mining of<i>Streptomyces</i>for the discovery of low-resistance antibiotics,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"2. Abstract Antimicrobial resistance is considered one of the top ten global health crises, which requires discovering and developing antibiotics with low resistance. Historically, Streptomyces bacteria are well-known for adapting to their complex environment by accumulating numerous clusters of specialized metabolites, some of which remain inactive in laboratory settings. The genomic revolution significantly increased their potential, complementing laboratory practices, and allowing for the discovery of antimicrobials associated with this biosynthetic machinery that are not constitutively produced. In the current study, we used the latest bioinformatics analyses to improve upon these predictions for Streptomyces genomes, and to identify low-resistance novel antimicrobial candidates. Our integrated pipeline used antiSMASH, BiG- SCAPE/EFI-EST, BiG-FAM, and additional tools and identified 326 novel BGCs and 67 peptides with antimicrobial potential. Further exploration of ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs) revealed diverse chemical structures and suggested new mechanisms of action. Artificial intelligence platforms, such as MACREL, predicted the antimicrobial activity of the identified peptides, offering a comprehensive strategy for discovering bioactive compounds. Their low-resistance potential was estimated on a case-by-case basis. This study showcases the extensive genomic potential of Streptomyces, providing valuable insights for future antibiotic discovery efforts. Graphical abstract 3. Impact statement Exploring the potential applications of microorganisms is essential in fields like medicine, ecology, and biotechnology. Genomics is an invaluable tool that can uncover secondary metabolites with various applications in these fields. To this end, we conducted a detailed analysis of 388 complete genomes of Streptomyces, with a focus on identifying new biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) and antimicrobial peptides. Our analysis involved the use of various tools, including AntiSMASH, BiG-SCAPE, and reference databases like MiBIG and BiG-FAM, to unravel the diversity of these biosynthetic systems. We established a manually curated database and a robust pipeline for identifying valuable compounds, which allowed us to prioritize 326 BGCs with novel and diverse biosynthetic machinery. These unique insights into the genomic richness of Streptomyces will serve as a valuable guide for future antibiotic discovery efforts, facilitating the selection of strains that can produce new natural products. Moreover, our approach also helped us identify 67 potential antimicrobial peptides, including some belonging to the newly discovered Class V lanthipeptides, highlighting the diversity and promise of these compounds. Our work offers a glimpse into the potential of genomics in identifying important molecules and provides a framework for future studies in this field.

rayyan-210757843,Multiple facets of cutting‐edge mycorrhizal research,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"‘Progress made in the field, presented at ICOM 11, has led to cutting-edge results that challenge current teachings on mycorrhizal fungi.’ Held on 1–5 August 2022, the 11th International Conference on Mycorrhiza (ICOM11) provided participants from 34 countries around the world with an overview of the latest research in the different mycorrhizal fields (Fig. 1). During this fully virtual edition hosted in Beijing, > 700 attendees and speakers of multiple time zones exchanged their thoughts and findings on mycorrhizas allowing a better comprehension of these fungal–plant partnerships and identifying key research perspectives. ICOM 11 facilitated an interesting discussion on how mycorrhizal fungi are affected by and respond to global change. Thanks to recent advances in molecular ecological and computational approaches, the distributions of plants forming arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) and ectomycorrhizal (EM) associations have been investigated comprehensively at a large scale. In his keynote presentation, Kabir Peay (Stanford University, CA, USA) presented the relative abundance of trees forming AM and EM symbioses as a function of latitude on a global scale. Furthermore, he demonstrated via global modeling and glasshouse experiments that climate change has a direct effect on mycorrhizal systems. An exploration of the environmental determinants of AM and EM distribution was also presented by Stephanie Kivlin (University of Tennessee, USA). In these studies, machine learning-based modeling approaches were developed to quantitatively describe the impact of climate transition signals and soil nutrient availability on the abundance of different mycorrhizal types. Peay showed that climate variables, more than soil nutrients, control the abundance of EM trees on a global scale, consistent with the findings of Barceló et al. (2019). Kivlin, however, suggested that while climate variables were the main factor affecting the distribution of mycorrhizal types, soil variables, such as soil organic carbon and sand content, also played an important role in this distribution. In summary, environmental factors stand out in shaping plant mycorrhizal type and the capacity of plants to form mycorrhizal associations. The patterns of mycorrhizal fungal diversity and their drivers are becoming better understood, and regional differences indicate a degree of dispersal limitation, with human impact such as pollution and agricultural management playing an important role. The evolution of mycorrhizal fungi has always been a subject of particular interest for the mycorrhizal research community. Approaching this topic from the plant side, Pierre-Marc Delaux (Université de Toulouse, France) proposed a set of plant genes required to allow AM symbiosis. Interestingly, almost all non-AM forming plants that specifically retain a portion of this gene set have been shown to host other kinds of intracellular symbioses such as intracellular bacteria, orchid mycorrhizas, or ericoid-like mycorrhizas (Radhakrishnan et al., 2020). There, thus, seems to occur a universal signaling pathway for plant intracellular symbiosis initially associated with AM fungi and co-opted in multiple plant lineages to form different symbiotic partnerships. On the fungal side, Annegret Kohler (Université de Lorraine, France) argued that the evolution from saprotrophic to EM fungal lifestyle was also associated with the co-option of genes preceding the appearance of symbiotic lifestyle complemented by lineage-specific innovation (Miyauchi et al., 2020). These co-opted genes appeared to be different among the independent EM fungal lineages but share similar functions. Despite these various advances, mechanisms leading to the mycorrhizal transition, and more generally the evolution of mycorrhizas, are far from understanding. Taking a leap forward with this notion, Leho Tedersoo (Tartu University, Estonia) proposed a focus on the Endogonomycetes lineage, which experienced multiple independent shifts to the EM fungal lifestyle, thus offering a promising playground to investigate mycorrhizal evolution (Chang et al., 2019; Rimington et al., 2019). Noteworthy, Mark Brundrett (University of Western Australia, Australia) raised one of the challenges of in silico analyses that include root and mycorrhizal coevolution studies: database reliability. In his presentation, Brundrett showed that errors in Mycorrhiza database increase over time and that a strong linear relationship exists between the abundance of mycorrhizal records and the frequency of mycorrhizal trait errors. These errors were mostly associated with publications predating current definition of mycorrhizal types, but also to new misdiagnosis especially on tree species with complex root anatomy or contaminations by samples roots of species that commonly grow together (Brundrett, 2021). Fortunately, at present, most of the data (90%) are correct but this will be an increasing concern in the future. Mycorrhizal fungi are not only intimately associated with plants, but are also entangled with diverse microbes that mutualistically, parasitically, or commensally colonize mycorrhizal hyphae. The soil upon, or close to, the mycorrhizal hyphae and beyond the influence of plant roots is called the hyphosphere. Hyphae are difficult to sample in isolation, as they are mixed with heterogeneous soil components and are fragile in nature. Thereby, the diversity of the mycorrhizal hyphosphere microbial community and its properties remain largely unknown. Thanks to the development of sequencing technologies and elaborately designed experiments, evidence presented at ICOM 11 indicates that mycorrhizas impact soil microbial communities and hyphosphere microbes exert important functions in mycorrhizal development. In temperate and boreal ecosystems, Bahram et al. (2018) presented evidence that plants forming EM and AM symbioses harbor distinct bacterial and fungal communities. In agricultural ecosystems, a series of experiments performed under divergent phosphorous conditions, presented by Lin Zhang (China Agricultural University, Beijing, China), demonstrated that the secretion of fructose by AM fungi increases the phosphatase activity in the soil. It does this by enriching the abundance of phosphorus-solubilizing bacteria colonizing the hyphosphere. In addition to the bacteria and fungi that actively interact with AM fungi, Jan Jansa (Czech Academy of Sciences, Prague, Czech Republic) draws attention to AM fungi–protist interactions. The addition of the soil protist Polysphondylium pallidum combined with a Paenibacillus sp. strain to AM fungal hyphae significantly increased the organic nitrogen utilization of the mycorrhizal plants (Rozmoš et al., 2022). In view of the increasing evidence that mycorrhiza-attached microbial communities play critical roles in mycorrhizal ecophysiology, several new research frontiers have been proposed. These new areas include the establishment of a global map of mycorrhiza-helper bacteria and mycorrhiza-associated microbiomes (as proposed by Marcel van der Heijden, Agroscope, Zurich, Switzerland). This work can lead to a better understanding of the contribution of mycorrhizas to nutrient cycling and ecosystem performance in general. Talks from three keynote speakers at ICOM 11 highlighted anomalies in aspects of mycorrhizal reproduction and taxonomy that challenged traditional views of these symbioses. Furthermore, these exceptions could have significant and widespread ecological impacts. For example, Anne Pringle (University of Wisconsin Madison, USA) explored how invasive fungi could satisfy the characteristics of an ‘ideal weed’ (as described by Baker in 1965), with an important criterion being the ability to be self-compatible. She showed that in rare cases Amanita phalloides individuals possessed only one mating type locus. The ability of these homokaryotic individuals to produce fruiting bodies and reproduce could therefore be an overlooked aspect of the invasive success of Amanita phalloides. By contrast, among AM fungi, Nicolas Corradi (University of Ottawa, Canada) showed that strains of Rhizophagus irregularis are either homokaryotic or dikaryotic, and that the ratio of coexisting parental nuclei in dikaryons is regulated in response to plant host identity, leading to potential advantages in fitness. Dikaryons are thought to be more generalist than homokaryons, as observed by their ability to produce more spores and denser hyphal networks with a wider range of host plants (Serghi et al., 2021). Megan Ryan (University of Western Australia, Australia) reminded us that AM fungi colonizing plants are not mono-phylogenetic but rather divided into Glomeromycotinian-AM fungi (G-AMF) and Mucoromycotinian-AM fungi (M-AMF). M-AMF, previously known as ‘fine root endophytes’, are understudied compared with G-AMF and thus our current understanding of them is limited. Researchers were encouraged to routinely check for both types of AM fungi, and to adopt the G-AMF/M-AMF terminology to increase clarity in research findings. M-AMF and G-AMF occupy distinct but overlapping ecological niches (Albornoz et al., 2022), suggesting differences in function and benefit to plants. All these studies have laid a strong foundation for new research to expand our understanding of mycorrhizal fungi and serve as a reminder to consider anomalies that may otherwise be missed. ICOM 11 successfully consolidated mycorrhizal research from a diverse range of disciplines and spatial scales. Ranging from ecosystem-level impacts of co-invasive EM fungi communities (Sapsford et al., 2022), as presented by Ian Dickie (University of Canterbury, New Zealand), to the flow of nutrients and development of intricate AM fungi hyphal networks, shown by Toby Kiers (Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, the Netherlands). Progress made in the field, presented at ICOM 11, has led to cutting-edge results that challenge current teachings on mycorrhizal fungi. These new findings will provide an excellent foundation for stimulating conversations and novel research to be presented at the next ICOM to be held in Manchester (UK) in 2024. The authors would like to thank all the participants of ICOM 11 and those who contributed with talks, posters, and engaging discussions, especially those whose names are not mentioned here due to constraints on space.

rayyan-210757918,Accelerating the discovery of biodiversity by detecting “new” species based on machine learning method,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract Background Recently, machine learning (ML) has been widely used in species auto-identification systems for multi-scene applications in biodiversity, while most of the existing ML systems relying on images are limited to identifying the species on which they are trained, and unknown species out of the system are normally incorrectly identified. Results Here, we propose a new workflow system based on the ML system and PERMANOVA analysis, named Taichi for the detection and confirmation of unknown species status, stimulated by the traditional biodiversity discovery process. First, we developed a series of high-throughput photography devices that could efficiently obtain aligned multiangle images for ML system training. Then the new analysis workflow was integrated in Python codes based on the convolutional neural networks: MobileNetV2 (selected from four available networks) and further PERMANOVA analysis of euclidean distances to detect 'new' species. Two newly established beetle datasets: Melanopopillia (4 species, 55 specimens, 42 450 images) and Hong Kong beetles (21 species, 206 specimens, 35 450 images) were constructed in this work to demonstrate the Taichi system. The diagnostic information for species is generated from the output results of the ML system (top-1 accuracy rate reached 97.76% and 96.22% respectively) naming as the artificial intelligence (AI) barcode, and extra analysis of AI barcodes could help visualization the diagnostic characters from multiangle images. Conclusions By comparing AI barcodes of different specimens outside the system, it is proved that the Taichi workflow can rapidly detect whether the input sample is a known species or possible 'new' species. This workflow provides a newly possible self-extensibility solution for the acceleration of biodiversity discovery. Additionally, it can also drive the development of data mining from the digitization of natural history collections around the world and has great potential to advance the field of biodiversity science.","",https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-3832815/v1,"",,
rayyan-210757956,Deep learning and satellite remote sensing for biodiversity monitoring and conservation,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract In the context of the current nature crisis, being able to reliably and cost‐effectively track subtle changes in the biosphere across adequate spatial and temporal extents and resolutions is crucial. Deep learning represents a group of versatile approaches to image processing tasks that are increasingly combined with satellite remote sensing imagery to monitor biodiversity and inform ecology and conservation, yet an overview of the opportunities and challenges associated with this development has so far been lacking. Here, we provide an interdisciplinary perspective on current research and technological developments associated with satellite remote sensing and deep learning that have the potential to make a difference in biodiversity monitoring and wildlife conservation; highlight challenges to the broader adoption of these approaches by experts operating at the interface between satellite remote sensing and ecology and conservation; and discuss how these can be overcome. By enabling the leveraging of big data and by providing new ways to learn about biodiversity and its dynamics, deep learning approaches promise to become a powerful tool to help address current monitoring needs and knowledge gaps. In certain situations, deep learning approaches may moreover substantially reduce the time and resources required to analyse satellite imagery. However, issues relating to capacity building, reference data access, environmental costs as well as model interpretability, robustness and alignment need to be addressed to successfully capitalize on these opportunities.","",https://doi.org/10.1002/rse2.415,"",,
rayyan-210758087,Climate change effects on animal presence in the Massaciuccoli Lake basin,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Big-data mining approaches based on Artificial Intelligence models can help forecast biodiversity changes before they happen. These approaches can predict macroscopic species distribution patterns and trends that can inform preventive measures to avoid the loss of ecosystem functions and services. They can, therefore, help study and mitigate climate change implications on biodiversity conservation in fragile ecosystems. Wetlands are particularly fragile ecosystems where climate change poses severe risks and has dramatically reduced their size over the past century, with profound consequences on biodiversity and ecosystem services. Through big-data mining approaches, we can predict future wetland biodiversity trends in the context of climate change. This paper proposes such predictive analysis for a specific wetland: The Massaciuccoli Lake basin in Tuscany, Italy. This basin is a critical tourist attraction due to its rich biodiversity, making it an area of interest for citizens, tourists, and scientists. However, the region's suitability for native and non-native species is at risk due to climate and land-use change. Using machine-learning models, we predict the potential effects of climate change on animal spatial distribution in the basin under different greenhouse gas emission scenarios. The results suggest that habitat suitability has generally improved from 1950 to today, presumably owing to the targeted conservation strategies adopted in the area, but climate change will severely reduce bird biodiversity by 2050 while favouring several insect species' proliferation and other species' habitat change, even under a medium-emission scenario. This will lead to significant changes in the basin's biodiversity. Our methodology is adaptable to other wetland basins, being fully based on open data and models. The spatially explicit modelling used in this research provides valuable information for policymakers and spatial planners, complementing traditional biodiversity trend analyses.","",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoinf.2024.102644,"",,
rayyan-210758168,Assessing urban forest biodiversity through automatic taxonomic identification of street trees from citizen science applications and remote-sensing imagery,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"The positive impact of urban forests and trees on the well-being of urban residents worldwide is well known. Resistance to pests, diseases, and extreme weather events are among the most critical characteristics of resilient cities, closely related to species richness and, consequently, to the diversity of street trees. However, urban forest inventories are currently scarce worldwide. For this reason, urban trees' biodiversity and capacity to provide these ecosystem services are not developed enough. Three state-of-the-art species identification applications were tested, Plant.id, Pl@ntNet and Seek (iNaturalist) to identify a large number of tree families, genera, and species automatically. Two individual Google Street View images were queried for each tree in the study area, adjusting the Field of View and pitch parameters. The predictive capacity of the three apps was compared, and a biodiversity analysis was performed for different geospatial scales within the study area (i.e., at the whole study area, neighborhood, and street levels, respectively). Notably, our research contributes in an innovative way to the assessment and monitoring of the ecosystem services provided by street trees and sheds light on the great potential of combining remote sensing, citizen science and artificial intelligence for urban forest biodiversity assessments at multiple spatial and temporal scales.","",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jag.2024.103735,"",,
rayyan-210758230,Climate and biodiversity change constrain the flow of cultural ecosystem services to people: A case study modeling birding across Africa under future climate scenarios,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Global change is currently impacting ecosystems and their contributions to people (i.e. ecosystem services). These impacts have consequences for societies and human well-being, especially in Africa. Historically, efforts have focused on assessing global change from a social or biophysical perspective, treating them as separate entities. Yet, our understanding of impacts to social-ecological systems remains limited, particularly in the Global South, due to a lack of data, tools, and approaches accounting for social and ecological aspects of ecosystem services. This is especially relevant for cultural ecosystem services as they are less tangible. We use a simple indicator and important provider of a multitude of cultural ecosystem services, birding, to understand how climate, biodiversity, and land use change will impact cultural ecosystem services across Africa. We explore how emerging tools and data can overcome limitations in mapping and modeling cultural ecosystem services, particularly in analyzing human preferences and behavior at large spatiotemporal scales and in data-poor regions. Leveraging crowdsourced data from eBird and using machine learning techniques we map and model recreational birding to assess the underlying social-ecological relationships and the impact of future climate and environmental change. We show that bird species richness, protected areas, accessibility, and max temperature contribute most to birding suitability across the continent. Further, we show spatial shifts in the suitability of birding under three future climate scenarios (SSP126, 370, and 585). Models suggest climate and biodiversity change will increasingly constrain the flow of birding related cultural ecosystem services across Africa. This has implications for human-nature interactions, development of countries, management of protected areas, and overall human well-being in the future. More generally, we highlight opportunities for crowdsourced datasets and machine learning to integrate non-material ecosystem services in models and thus, enhance the understanding of future impacts to ecosystem services and human well-being.","",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.170872,"",,
rayyan-210758321,Farmland quality assessment using deep learning and UAVs,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"The transformation of agricultural landscapes due to the intensification of farming practices has placed a major threat on habitat and species diversity. Stopping the loss of biodiversity is addressed in various international treaties and adequate strategies are required to assess the initial status of biodiversity and to measure the success of policies. While traditional methods of field-based biodiversity monitoring are time consuming, costly, and highly surveyor-dependent, recent advances in remote sensing and machine learning enable a systematic, more general and cost-effective monitoring. Accordingly, this study investigated whether large-scale biodiversity monitoring campaigns such as the European Monitoring of Biodiversity in Agricultural Landscapes (EMBAL) could be supported by the use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) based remote sensing and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). For this purpose, the Structural Nature Value (SNV) indicator was proposed, which allows an intuitive estimation of the species richness of landscape sections. Subsequently, a CNN was trained to directly predict the SNV. For the accuracy assessment, a survey was conducted in which participants were asked to assess the SNV for various landscape patches, both to obtain an independent test set, and to evaluate the intuitiveness of the concept. The CNN achieved a mean weighted F1-score of 0.81 with an overall accuracy of 81 %. It was shown that the CNN can provide promising results to not only aid large-scale biodiversity monitorings, but to enhance the quality of their results through the automated analysis of fine-resolution UAV imagery.","",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rsase.2024.101235,"",,
rayyan-210758338,New frontiers in AI for biodiversity research and conservation with multimodal language models,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into biodiversity research and conservation is growing rapidly, demonstrating great potential in reducing the intensive human labor required for data preprocessing, thereby, facilitating larger data collections that offer ecological insights at unprecedented scales. However, most of these AI applications for biodiversity are still in the early stages of development, hindered by challenges inherent in real-world datasets and the limited accessibility of these technologies to practitioners without extensive programming knowledge. The recent advent of multimodal language models, which can process and generate multiple data modalities, has significantly expanded the realm of possible AI applications in biodiversity research. These models have demonstrated the ability to classify species and recognize more complex concepts, such as animal postures and orientations, without prior exposure during training. Multimodal language models can also provide explanations for their predictions and interact with humans in natural language, thereby making them more transparent, intuitive, and accessible to non-specialists. Despite these advancements, the use of multimodal language models for biodiversity still needs to overcome unique barriers to application, including high computational and financial demands, reliance on prompt engineering for consistent model performance on large datasets, and insufficient open-source sharing of state-of-the-art methods. This paper explores the transformative potential of multimodal language models for biodiversity research, compared with traditional machine learning methods, and discusses several potential applications in biodiversity research. We also discuss challenges to implementing these models in real-world conservation scenarios and propose directions for future research to overcome these hurdles. Our goal is to encourage robust discussions and research into the integration of multimodal language models to advance AI for biodiversity research and conservation.","",https://doi.org/10.32942/x22s6f,"",,
rayyan-210758348,Artificial neuronal networks are revolutionizing entomological research,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract The application of artificial intelligence (AI) in entomological research has gained significant attention in recent years. This review summarizes the current state of research on the potential of AI methods in various subfields of entomology, such as behavioural biology, biodiversity research, climate change research, pest management, and disease vector control. In some cases, AI‐based species identification methods based on deep learning neuronal network models have been shown to outperform traditional morphological identification methods in terms of accuracy and speed. Behavioural biology research has been enhanced through the use of AI‐based tracking systems that can classify insect behaviour and movement patterns. Habitat modelling has also been improved with the use of AI, allowing for the creation of more accurate models that can predict insect distribution and abundance. Climate change and biodiversity research have benefited from AI‐driven tools that can analyse large datasets and predict the impact of environmental changes on insect populations. In agriculture, pest management has been revolutionized by AI methods, with the development of smart traps and monitoring systems that can detect and identify pest species in real‐time, enabling targeted control measures. Disease vector control has also been improved through the use of AI‐based predictive models, which can identify areas at risk of disease transmission and aid in the development of effective control strategies. In conclusion, AI methods have the potential to revolutionize many aspects of entomological research. Future research should focus on developing more sophisticated AI tools and integrating them into entomological research to address even more complex ecological questions.","",https://doi.org/10.1111/jen.13227,"",,
rayyan-210758379,Deep learning-based detection of indicator species for monitoring biodiversity in semi-natural grasslands,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Deep learning (DL) has huge potential to provide valuable insights into biodiversity changes in species-rich agricultural ecosystems such as semi-natural grasslands, helping to prioritize and plan conservation efforts. However, DL has been underexplored in grassland conservation efforts, hindered by data scarcity, intricate ecosystem interactions, and limited economic incentives. Here, we developed a DL-based object-detection model to identify indicator species, a group of vascular plant species that serve as surrogates for biodiversity assessment in High Nature Value (HNV) grasslands. We selected indicator species Armeria maritima, Campanula patula, Cirsium oleraceum, and Daucus carota. To overcome the hurdle of limited data, we grew indicator plants under controlled greenhouse conditions, generating a sufficient dataset for DL model training. The model was initially trained on this greenhouse dataset. Then, smaller datasets derived from an experimental grassland plot and natural grasslands were added to the training to facilitate the transition from greenhouse to field conditions. Our optimized model achieved remarkable average precision (AP) on test datasets, with 98.6 AP50 on greenhouse data, 98.2 AP50 on experimental grassland data, and 96.5 AP50 on semi-natural grassland data. Our findings highlight the innovative application of greenhouse-grown specimens for the in-situ identification of plants, bolstering biodiversity monitoring in grassland ecosystems. Furthermore, the study illuminates the promising role of DL techniques in conservation programs, particularly as a monitoring tool to support result-based agri-environment schemes.","",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ese.2024.100419,"",,

The increasing difficulty of synthesising this literature manually has simultaneously resulted in a growing demand for automated text mining methods. Within the domain of deep learning, large language models (LLMs) have been the subject of considerable attention in recent years due to great leaps in progress and a wide range of potential applications; however, quantitative investigation into their potential in ecology has so far been lacking. In this work, we analyse the ability of GPT‐4 to extract information about invertebrate pests and pest controllers from abstracts of articles on biological pest control, using a bespoke, zero‐shot prompt. Our results show that the performance of GPT‐4 is highly competitive with other state‐of‐the‐art tools used for taxonomic named entity recognition and geographic location extraction tasks. On a held‐out test set, we show that species and geographic locations are extracted with F1‐scores of 99.8% and 95.3%, respectively, and highlight that the model can effectively distinguish between ecological roles of interest such as predators, parasitoids and pests. Moreover, we demonstrate the model's ability to effectively extract and predict taxonomic information across various taxonomic ranks. However, we do report a small number of cases of fabricated information (confabulations). Due to a lack of specialised, pre‐trained ecological language models, general‐purpose LLMs may provide a promising way forward in ecology. Combined with tailored prompt engineering, such models can be employed for a wide range of text mining tasks in ecology, with the potential to greatly reduce time spent on manual screening and labelling of the literature.","",https://doi.org/10.1111/2041-210x.14341,"",,

rayyan-210758426,"From buzzes to bytes: A systematic review of automated bioacoustics models used to detect, classify and monitor insects",,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract Insects play vital ecological roles; many provide essential ecosystem services while others are economically devastating pests and disease vectors. Concerns over insect population declines and expansion have generated a pressing need to effectively monitor insects across broad spatial and temporal scales. A promising approach is bioacoustics, which uses sound to study ecological communities. Despite recent increases in machine learning technologies, the status of emerging automated bioacoustics methods for monitoring insects is not well known, limiting potential applications. To address this gap, we systematically review the effectiveness of automated bioacoustics models over the past four decades, analysing 176 studies that met our inclusion criteria. We describe their strengths and limitations compared to traditional methods and propose productive avenues forward. We found automated bioacoustics models for 302 insect species distributed across nine Orders. Studies used intentional calls (e.g. grasshopper stridulation), by‐products of flight (e.g. bee wingbeats) and indirectly produced sounds (e.g. grain movement) for identification. Pests were the most common study focus, driven largely by weevils and borers moving in dried food and wood. All disease vector studies focused on mosquitoes. A quarter of the studies compared multiple insect families. Our review illustrates that machine learning, and deep learning in particular, are becoming the gold standard for bioacoustics automated modelling approaches. We identified models that could classify hundreds of insect species with over 90% accuracy. Bioacoustics models can be useful for reducing lethal sampling, monitoring phenological patterns within and across days and working in locations or conditions where traditional methods are less effective (e.g. shady, shrubby or remote areas). However, it is important to note that not all insect taxa emit easily detectable sounds, and that sound pollution may impede effective recordings in some environmental contexts. Synthesis and applications : Automated bioacoustics methods can be a useful tool for monitoring insects and addressing pressing ecological and societal questions. Successful applications include assessing insect biodiversity, distribution and behaviour, as well as evaluating the effectiveness of restoration and pest control efforts. We recommend collaborations among ecologists and machine learning experts to increase model use by researchers and practitioners.","",https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2664.14630,"",,

rayyan-210758568,Insect detect: An open-source DIY camera trap for automated insect monitoring,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Insect monitoring is essential to design effective conservation strategies, which are indispensable to mitigate worldwide declines and biodiversity loss. For this purpose, traditional monitoring methods are widely established and can provide data with a high taxonomic resolution. However, processing of captured insect samples is often time-consuming and expensive, which limits the number of potential replicates. Automated monitoring methods can facilitate data collection at a higher spatiotemporal resolution with a comparatively lower effort and cost. Here, we present the Insect Detect DIY (do-it-yourself) camera trap for non-invasive automated monitoring of flower-visiting insects, which is based on low-cost off-the-shelf hardware components combined with open-source software. Custom trained deep learning models detect and track insects landing on an artificial flower platform in real time on-device and subsequently classify the cropped detections on a local computer. Field deployment of the solar-powered camera trap confirmed its resistance to high temperatures and humidity, which enables autonomous deployment during a whole season. On-device detection and tracking can estimate insect activity/abundance after metadata post-processing. Our insect classification model achieved a high top-1 accuracy on the test dataset and generalized well on a real-world dataset with captured insect images. The camera trap design and open-source software are highly customizable and can be adapted to different use cases. With custom trained detection and classification models, as well as accessible software programming, many possible applications surpassing our proposed deployment method can be realized.","",https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0295474,"",,
rayyan-210758583,Large language models help facilitate the automated synthesis of information on potential pest controllers,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"The body of ecological literature, which informs much of our knowledge of the global loss of biodiversity, has been experiencing rapid growth in recent decades. The increasing difficulty to synthesise this literature manually has simultaneously resulted in a growing demand for automated text mining methods.

rayyan-210758649,Using photographs and deep neural networks to understand flowering phenology and diversity in mountain meadows,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract Mountain meadows are an essential part of the alpine–subalpine ecosystem; they provide ecosystem services like pollination and are home to diverse plant communities. Changes in climate affect meadow ecology on multiple levels, for example, by altering growing season dynamics. Tracking the effects of climate change on meadow diversity through the impacts on individual species and overall growing season dynamics is critical to conservation efforts. Here, we explore how to combine crowd‐sourced camera images with machine learning to quantify flowering species richness across a range of elevations in alpine meadows located in Mt. Rainier National Park, Washington, USA. We employed three machine‐learning techniques (Mask R‐CNN, RetinaNet and YOLOv5) to detect wildflower species in images taken during two flowering seasons. We demonstrate that deep learning techniques can detect multiple species, providing information on flowering richness in photographed meadows. The results indicate higher richness just above the tree line for most of the species, which is comparable with patterns found using field studies. We found that the two‐stage detector Mask R‐CNN was more accurate than single‐stage detectors like RetinaNet and YOLO, with the Mask R‐CNN network performing best overall with mean average precision (mAP) of 0.67 followed by RetinaNet (0.5) and YOLO (0.4). We found that across the methods using anchor box variations in multiples of 16 led to enhanced accuracy. We also show that detection is possible even when pictures are interspersed with complex backgrounds and are not in focus. We found differential detection rates depending on species abundance, with additional challenges related to similarity in flower characteristics, labeling errors and occlusion issues. Despite these potential biases and limitations in capturing flowering abundance and location‐specific quantification, accuracy was notable considering the complexity of flower types and picture angles in this dataset. We, therefore, expect that this approach can be used to address many ecological questions that benefit from automated flower detection, including studies of flowering phenology and floral resources, and that this approach can, therefore, complement a wide range of ecological approaches (e.g., field observations, experiments, community science, etc.). In all, our study suggests that ecological metrics like floral richness can be efficiently monitored by combining machine learning with easily accessible publicly curated datasets (e.g., Flickr, iNaturalist).","",https://doi.org/10.1002/rse2.382,"",,
rayyan-210758666,From simple labels to semantic image segmentation: leveraging citizen science plant photographs for tree species mapping in drone imagery,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract. Knowledge of plant species distributions is essential for various application fields, such as nature conservation, agriculture, and forestry. Remote sensing data, especially high-resolution orthoimages from unoccupied aerial vehicles (UAVs), paired with novel pattern-recognition methods, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), enable accurate mapping (segmentation) of plant species. Training transferable pattern-recognition models for species segmentation across diverse landscapes and data characteristics typically requires extensive training data. Training data are usually derived from labor-intensive field surveys or visual interpretation of remote sensing images. Alternatively, pattern-recognition models could be trained more efficiently with plant photos and labels from citizen science platforms, which include millions of crowd-sourced smartphone photos and the corresponding species labels. However, these pairs of citizen-science-based photographs and simple species labels (one label for the entire image) cannot be used directly for training state-of-the-art segmentation models used for UAV image analysis, which require per-pixel labels for training (also called masks). Here, we overcome the limitation of simple labels of citizen science plant observations with a two-step approach. In the first step, we train CNN-based image classification models using the simple labels and apply them in a moving-window approach over UAV orthoimagery to create segmentation masks. In the second phase, these segmentation masks are used to train state-of-the-art CNN-based image segmentation models with an encoder–decoder structure. We tested the approach on UAV orthoimages acquired in summer and autumn at a test site comprising 10 temperate deciduous tree species in varying mixtures. Several tree species could be mapped with surprising accuracy (mean F1 score =0.47). In homogenous species assemblages, the accuracy increased considerably (mean F1 score =0.55). The results indicate that several tree species can be mapped without generating new training data and by only using preexisting knowledge from citizen science. Moreover, our analysis revealed that the variability in citizen science photographs, with respect to acquisition data and context, facilitates the generation of models that are transferable through the vegetation season. Thus, citizen science data may greatly advance our capacity to monitor hundreds of plant species and, thus, Earth's biodiversity across space and time.","",https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-21-2909-2024,"",,
rayyan-210758696,Harnessing Computational Methods to Characterize Chemical Impacts on Biodiversity,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Chemical pollution can threaten biodiversity at different levels, from genetically diverse populations (genetic diversity) to different species (species diversity) and ecosystem traits/interactions (functional diversity). Most assessments of chemical impacts on different biodiversity levels depend on wet lab and field experiments, including sequencing large numbers of organisms, environmental DNA approaches, single chemical–species–outcome toxicity tests, and trait-based methods. However, it is impossible to assess all chemicals, species, populations, and ecosystems using these methods. Therefore, we advocate that computational methods are necessary to characterize, quantify, and predict chemical impacts on biodiversity. We briefly introduce the current state of research into chemical impacts on genetic diversity, species diversity, and functional diversity and describe new opportunities for computational methods like data integration, machine learning, cross-species/cross-ecosystem extrapolation, adverse outcome pathways, and Bayesian methods to support research in these three areas. By harnessing data and methods currently at our disposal and preparing methods to take advantage of continuously emerging data sets, computational approaches can be paired with environmental monitoring so different levels of biological organization can serve as consecutive warning signs for chemical impacts on biodiversity. This will enable effective ecosystem protection measures to be better developed and implemented to prevent biodiversity loss from chemical pollution.","",https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.estlett.3c00865,"",,
rayyan-210758773,A gentle introduction to computer vision‐based specimen classification in ecological datasets,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract Classifying specimens is a critical component of ecological research, biodiversity monitoring and conservation. However, manual classification can be prohibitively time‐consuming and expensive, limiting how much data a project can afford to process. Computer vision, a form of machine learning, can help overcome these problems by rapidly, automatically and accurately classifying images of specimens. Given the diversity of animal species and contexts in which images are captured, there is no universal classifier for all species and use cases. As such, ecologists often need to train their own models. While numerous software programs exist to support this process, ecologists need a fundamental understanding of how computer vision works to select appropriate model workflows based on their specific use case, data types, computing resources and desired performance capabilities. Ecologists may also face characteristic quirks of ecological datasets, such as long‐tail distributions, ‘unknown’ species, similarity between species and polymorphism within species, which impact the efficacy of computer vision. Despite growing interest in computer vision for ecology, there are few resources available to help ecologists face the challenges they are likely to encounter. Here, we present a gentle introduction for species classification using computer vision. In this manuscript and associated GitHub repository, we demonstrate how to prepare training data, basic model training procedures, and methods for model evaluation and selection. Throughout, we explore specific considerations ecologists should make when training classification models, such as data domains, feature extractors and class imbalances. With these basics, ecologists can adjust their workflows to achieve research goals and/or account for uncertainty in downstream analysis. Our goal is to provide guidance for ecologists for getting started in or improving their use of machine learning for visual classification tasks.","",https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2656.14042,"",,
rayyan-210758841,A technological biodiversity monitoring toolkit for biocredits,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract Biodiversity is in crisis globally, and we consistently fail to hit global targets to stem its loss. Inspired by the Kunming‐Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework, the biodiversity credit market offers an avenue for vital funding for biodiversity conservation projects around the world. Various biodiversity credit methodologies and standards are becoming available, and most will require the measurement and monitoring of biodiversity at scale. Private investment in conservation through biodiversity credits entails specific needs for biodiversity data collection, including the need for biodiversity claims to be verifiable. We conceptualise these requirements around ‘SAGED’ criteria: Scalable , Accessible , Granular (data of appropriate spatial, taxonomic and temporal resolution), Evidenceable and Directly measured (where possible). Measuring and monitoring biodiversity across ecosystems, ecoregions and taxa is expensive and time‐consuming with traditional survey methods. These methods often rely on access to experts with sufficient taxonomic and survey expertise, which is challenging in many parts of the world. Accordingly, we review biodiversity monitoring technologies and assess their readiness to fulfil key requirements of assessments for the purpose of nature accounting for biodiversity credits (particularly SAGED criteria). We focus on monitoring technologies that are commonly cited by biodiversity credit methodologies, including (e)DNA metabarcoding, passive acoustic monitoring and various other remote sensing methods. We also explore the current limits of these techniques in obtaining appropriate biodiversity measures and metrics for biodiversity finance. Synthesis and applications . Technological solutions for biodiversity monitoring are not (yet) a panacea but are key for evidenceable monitoring at scale. For current use in biocredit markets, we advise these are combined with ground validation and human‐collected ecological data. Developments in automation and machine learning will rapidly make these technologies more accessible and efficient.","",https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2664.14725,"",,

For a sustainable transition to a low-carbon future, it is essential to minimise impacts of mineral resource development to the environment, ecosystems, and societies of these nations. Although there has been considerable progress in the social aspects of the mining sector, environmental metrics are not showing comparable improvement. The Philippines exemplifies this challenge as a country that aims to conserve its exceptional biodiversity to maximise ecosystem services while expanding mining activities for economic growth, in a geographical setting with high mineral potential and vulnerability to natural hazards and climate change. Similar to many mining areas, environmental baselines are mostly non-existent, compounded by a legacy of mining impacts despite an established policy framework. We review issues associated with large- and small-scale mining and identify underlying research challenges and opportunities in the Philippines. Potential environmental research pathways include (i) innovative approaches for catchment scale characterisation and identification of contaminant sources; (ii) quantifying and predicting contaminant transport; (iii) deployment of flexible monitoring devices for larger-scale water quality monitoring programmes; (iv) tailings dam monitoring and management; and (v) resource assessment and metal recovery in ores and tailings. By integrating geomorphological tools with geochemical data, as well as 2D/3D numerical modelling techniques, it becomes possible to predict and understand the behaviour and fate of contaminants across different spatial and temporal scales. The development of cost-effective water quality assessment devices and protocols can help overcome logistical challenges in monitoring a wider range of hydrological conditions. Advanced applications of remote sensing, combined with machine learning, and geophysical monitoring systems provide new opportunities to detect mining footprints and observe change in tailings dams more effectively. Potential impacts of mine wastes can be further minimised by exploring innovative technologies such as the use of metal-accumulating native plant species and environmentally safe solvents to reprocess modern and legacy tailings. Insights from these pathways will enable the realisation of a more sustainable mining future, through the incorporation of findings into existing and future governmental and small- and large-scale mining policy and practice.

rayyan-210758933,A novel approach for calculating prediction uncertainty when using acoustic indices and machine learning algorithms to monitor animal communities,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"<title>Abstract</title> There is a growing interest in using passive acoustic monitoring methods to survey biodiversity. Many studies have investigated the efficacy of acoustic indices in monitoring animal communities, particularly bird species richness, with mixed results. It has been suggested that combining multiple acoustic indices could improve accuracy. To accomplish this, researchers have employed machine learning methods, such as the Random Forest Regression, which are considered more robust in this context. However, most machine learning methods have a limitation in that they do not provide well-calibrated uncertainty quantification measures for their predictions. Quantifying uncertainty with the use of appropriate prediction intervals is of paramount importance for making informed management decisions. In this study, we propose addressing this issue using a Machine Learning framework, called Conformal Prediction, which has been developed to provide guaranteed coverage prediction intervals. Specifically, we examine the application of a recently proposed combination of Conformal Prediction with Gaussian Process Regression using data collected through bird and acoustic surveys at biodiverse sites in Cyprus and Australia. Our goal is to demonstrate how the Conformal Prediction framework can be used to assess the models’ prediction accuracy and associated uncertainty when monitoring biodiversity using acoustic indices and machine learning methods. Moreover, we discuss how the framework can be integrated into a wider range of ecological applications to help make more informed conservation management decisions.","",https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-4494063/v1,"",,
rayyan-210758985,A new era of genetic diversity conservation through novel tools and accessible data,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Due to increasing alarm over lost diversity, the past few years have seen quantum leaps in making genetics more accessible and relevant for use in practice and policy. A historic advance for conservation was made at the 2022 United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity COP15, when genetic diversity was protected for all species—not just socioeconomically and culturally valuable ones—in the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF). Here, we highlight new, affordable, and inclusive tools for measuring genetic diversity and emphasize the importance of their use to benefit nature and society. Improved application of genetic diversity data to conservation and management first requires documenting change across space and time. Meta-analyses have shown substantial genetic losses—incurred during the past century—in many species, especially those endemic to islands or that are heavily harvested (eg commercial fisheries). Genomic patterns across thousands of DNA nucleotides (eg runs of homozygosity) can now provide deeper insight into demographic histories, inbreeding, and the effects of natural selection. New models such as the mutations–area relationship can quantify the effects of habitat loss on genetic diversity at the population level, thereby helping to approximate the impacts of both threats and management (including restoration) activities. Meanwhile, Genetic Composition Essential Biodiversity Variables were developed to standardize the reporting of genetic diversity and to facilitate comparisons across studies (Biol Rev 2022; doi.org/10.1111/brv.12852). FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) have also been embraced to enable better comparisons across species and regions and to allow for more transparent and rigorous conclusions. Major efforts have focused on compiling, aggregating, and creating detailed metadata for thousands of previously produced genetic datasets. Through such efforts, an entirely new discipline—macrogenetics, which involves analyzing thousands of datasets to identify ecological drivers of genetic change in space and time—has arisen. Macrogenetics can empower systematic conservation planning, while also enabling the comparison of global genetic diversity maps to species-richness maps (Nat Rev Genet 2021; doi.org/10.1038/s41576-021-00394-0). Even as genetic data become more available, >99% of described species have yet to be studied genetically. Consequently, scalable and affordable non-DNA–based indicators were built on core evolutionary principles (eg maintaining sufficiently large distinct populations to prevent genetic erosion) and adopted by the GBF. These indicators enable rapid estimation of genetic diversity for more inclusive assessment and conservation action at large scales, including within developing and megadiverse countries (Conserv Lett 2023; doi.org/10.1111/conl.12953). Inclusivity is an important emphasis for the field of conservation genetics, with CARE principles (Collective benefit, Authority to control, Responsibility, and Ethics) adopted/adhered to during the collection, analysis, storage, and interpretation of genetic data, and linkage to other biodiversity information (eg occurrence data in the Global Biodiversity Information Facility). For decades, analyses of DNA sequences have helped guide ecological restoration, assess population resilience, and track processes like inbreeding or hybridization to address applied management questions. Formalized genetic monitoring programs at regional or national levels can be used to repeatedly and systematically assess populations through time to detect deleterious changes in genetic diversity that may require urgent protections. Genetic monitoring across species and ecosystems has identified areas undergoing rapid habitat loss or climate change—for example, by highlighting the importance of niche margins to protect unique genetic diversity (Nat Ecol Evol 2024; doi.org/10.1038/s41559-023-02260-0). Moving forward, genetic diversity assessments are likely to include more remote data collection, like environmental DNA (eDNA), to infer species' presence through the analysis of DNA shed into the environment (for example, in water, soil, or air). The field of eDNA is experiencing rapid technological advances that include abundance estimations and the sequencing of genetic diversity within populations. Simultaneously, high-resolution satellite imagery and deep learning can be used to estimate genetic diversity and population differentiation, without the need to physically sample DNA. We have entered a new era of transparent and inclusive analysis of the world's genetic diversity with advancements in macrogenetics, proxy-based tools, FAIR and CARE standards, and novel technologies. Uptake of new approaches can be amplified by collaborating through regional and global initiatives, such as the Coalition for Conservation Genetics (Conserv Sci Pract 2022; doi.org/10.1111/csp2.12635). Additional resources, along with new legal frameworks, tools, and policies, can help to advance the contributions of genetics in applied ecology and biodiversity conservation.","",https://doi.org/10.1002/fee.2740,"",,
rayyan-210759038,Tree Species Classification from UAV Canopy Images with Deep Learning Models,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Forests play a critical role in the provision of ecosystem services, and understanding their compositions, especially tree species, is essential for effective ecosystem management and conservation. However, identifying tree species is challenging and time-consuming. Recently, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with various sensors have emerged as a promising technology for species identification due to their relatively low cost and high spatial and temporal resolutions. Moreover, the advancement of various deep learning models makes remote sensing based species identification more a reality. However, three questions remain to be answered: first, which of the state-of-the-art models performs best for this task; second, which is the optimal season for tree species classification in a temperate forest; and third, whether a model trained in one season can be effectively transferred to another season. To address these questions, we focus on tree species classification by using five state-of-the-art deep learning models on UAV-based RGB images, and we explored the model transferability between seasons. Utilizing UAV images taken in the summer and fall, we captured 8799 crown images of eight species. We trained five models using summer and fall images and compared their performance on the same dataset. All models achieved high performances in species classification, with the best performance on summer images, with an average F1-score was 0.96. For the fall images, Vision Transformer (ViT), EfficientNetB0, and YOLOv5 achieved F1-scores greater than 0.9, outperforming both ResNet18 and DenseNet. On average, across the two seasons, ViT achieved the best accuracy. This study demonstrates the capability of deep learning models in forest inventory, particularly for tree species classification. While the choice of certain models may not significantly affect performance when using summer images, the advanced models prove to be a better choice for fall images. Given the limited transferability from one season to another, further research is required to overcome the challenge associated with transferability across seasons.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/rs16203836,"",,
rayyan-210759072,The FAIR-Device - a non-lethal and generalist semi-automatic Malaise trap for insect biodiversity monitoring: Proof of concept,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Field monitoring plays a crucial role in understanding insect dynamics within ecosystems. It facilitates pest distribution assessment, control measure evaluation, and prediction of pest outbreaks. Additionally, it provides important information on bioindicators with which the state of biodiversity and ecological integrity in specific habitats and ecosystems can be accurately assessed. However, traditional monitoring systems can present various difficulties, leading to a limited temporal and spatial resolution of the obtained information. Despite recent advancements in automatic insect monitoring traps, also called e-traps, most of these systems focus exclusively on studying agricultural pests, rendering them unsuitable for monitoring diverse insect populations. To address this issue, we introduce the Field Automatic Insect Recognition (FAIR)-Device, a novel non-lethal field tool that relies on semi-automatic image capture and species identification using artificial intelligence via the iNaturalist platform. Our objective was to develop a low-effort, cost-effective, and non-specific monitoring solution capable of providing high-resolution data for assessing insect diversity. During a 26-day proof-of-concept evaluation, the FAIR-Device recorded 24.8 GB of video, identifying 431 individuals from 9 orders, 50 families, and 69 genera. While improvements are possible, our device demonstrated potential as a cost-effective, non-lethal tool for monitoring insect biodiversity. Looking ahead, we envision new monitoring systems such as e-traps as valuable tools for real-time insect monitoring, offering unprecedented insights for ecological research and agricultural practices.","",https://doi.org/10.22541/au.172115021.15608503/v1,"",,
rayyan-210759141,Pharmaceuticals and Personal Care Products in the Environment: What Progress Has Been Made in Addressing the Big Research Questions?,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) include numerous chemical classes to prevent or treat human and animal disease or improve the quality of daily life of humans. During the life cycles of these products, it is inevitable that they will be released to the natural environment. It is, therefore, not surprising that a wide range of ingredients used in PPCPs has been detected widely in surface waters, soils, sediments, and groundwaters across the world (Aus der Beek et al., 2016; Wilkinson et al., 2022). Pharmaceuticals and many personal care products are biologically active compounds that are designed to interact with specific pathways and processes in targets in humans and animals. Concerns have therefore been raised about the potential effects of PPCPs in the environment on public health, biodiversity, and ecosystem services. Since the late 1990s, a substantial amount of work has been done to determine the occurrence, fate, effects, and risks of PPCPs in the environment. Recognizing the concerns around PPCPs in the environment and the value in providing some focus for research in the area, in 2011 the Pharmaceutical Advisory Group of the Society of Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry (SETAC) initiated a horizon scanning exercise to identify the top research questions related to pharmaceuticals in the environment. The hope then was that the results of the exercise would help in informing the design, coordination, and implementation of future environmental research programs on PPCPs and thus provide a better understanding of the potential and relative risks of these substances in the natural environment, allowing us to more effectively control and manage these risks. The exercise employed a ""key question"" approach where research questions were Initially solicited from academic, government, and business communities around the world. A list of 101 questions was then discussed at an international expert workshop, and a top-20 list was developed, with these questions falling into seven categories: (1) prioritization of substances for assessment, (2) pathways of exposure, (3) bioavailability and uptake, (4) effects characterization, (5) risk and relative risk, (6) antibiotic resistance, and (7) risk management. Following the workshop these questions were ranked by importance. In 2012, the results of this exercise were published in a review paper in Environmental Health Perspectives entitled ""Pharmaceuticals and Personal Care Products in the Environment: What Are the Big Questions"" (Boxall et al., 2012). Since publication, this paper has had significant impact on the research community, being cited over 1000 times. The exercise also provided a foundation for the broader SETAC Global Horizon Scanning Exercise, which identified priority research questions around sustainable environmental quality in North America, Asia, Australasia, Europe, and Latin America. The questions from this exercise have been published in a series of papers covering each of the geographical regions (Gaw et al., 2019; Fairbrother et al., 2019; Furley et al., 2018; Leung et al., 2020; van den Brink et al., 2018). As 2022 was the 10th anniversary of the Environmental Health Perspectives publication, we felt that it would be timely to review the state of the science around the questions identified in the PPCP 20 questions paper and to look forward to the next 10 years. This special issue has therefore been developed where leading researchers from around the world were invited to give their perspectives on the current level of knowledge around the different questions identified in the 2012 paper and to identify new research questions related to each topic area that are a priority for research over the next decade. In developing their manuscripts, authors were asked to consider the topic area of the question from multiple perspectives—scientific, regulatory, technical—and to go well beyond their own work. We asked that the papers give an authoritative and up-to-date understanding of the subject matter relating to the question. This special issue, therefore, provides an overview of the current state of the science around 14 of the 20 key questions (Table 1) and a forward-looking synthesis on research priorities for the coming years. Pharmaceuticals and Personal Care Products in the Aquatic Environment: How Can Regions at Risk Be Identified in the Future? Taken together, the papers in the special issue show that significant progress has been made since 2012 in developing our understanding of the inputs, occurrence, fate, effects, and risks of PPCPs in the environment and of advancing approaches to characterize and manage PPCP risks. In terms of prioritization, a range of exposure-, hazard-, and risk-based approaches have been developed and applied to identify PPCPs of most concern in the environment (Mo et al., 2024). These approaches have now been applied to a wide range of geographies, giving us an insight into which PPCPs are of most concern in different regions of the world (Mo et al., 2024). We now have a much improved understanding of the uptake of PPCPs into organisms. Progress here has been made on the development of models to estimate the uptake of ionizable PPCPs into invertebrates, fish, earthworms, and plants (Carter et al., 2024). These developments have been supported by developments in in vitro testing methodologies and increasing access to machine learning modeling methodologies, such as artificial neural networks (Carter et al., 2024). Significant progress has been made in the development of methods to extrapolate from effects of PPCPs in humans to effects in the natural environment. For pharmaceuticals, we have now moved from the evaluation of single-drug targets in organisms to an understanding of the conservation of all know drug targets in a wide range of species (Margiotta-Casaluci et al., 2024). Alongside this, there have been major advances in the development of adverse outcome pathways (AOPs) for PPCPs from different molecular initiation events, providing us with a much stronger foundation for extrapolating molecular-level effects to effects on whole organisms (Brooks et al., 2024; Margiotta-Casaluci et al., 2024). The experimental effects testing area has seen the development of a range of new approach methodologies aimed at reducing the use of whole-animal tests, including approaches for bioaccumulation, weight-of-evidence approaches, and omics-based applications (Langan et al., 2024). The last decade has also seen an increase in the amount of data on the ecotoxicological interactions of mixtures of pharmaceuticals, including mixture effects at the molecular level; and this has helped us to evaluate mixture toxicity models for estimating the effects of pharmaceutical mixtures (Kidd et al., 2024). Significant developments in methodologies for effects-directed analyses, including increasing access to high-resolution mass spectrometry for nontargeted analysis, means that we are now much better placed to identify drivers of toxicity in complex and undefined mixtures (Kidd et al., 2024). Increasing availability of openly available software systems, such as ECODrug, SeqAPASS, MAPPFAST, AOPwiki, and sources of toxicity ecotoxicity data (e.g., REACH dossiers, ToxCast), means that the research community is much better placed to understand the effects of PPCPs on aquatic and terrestrial organisms (Ankley et al., 2024; Margiotta-Casaluci et al., 2024) and to advance the precision of environmental assessments (Brooks et al., 2024). In the past decade, the number of PPCPs monitored in the environment has risen, and there has been increasing access to data on the occurrence of PPCPs across the globe (Wilkinson et al., 2024). Alongside this improvement, there have been significant developments in exposure modeling approaches, such as ePiE, PhATE, STREAM-EU, and GLOBAL-FATE, which provide exposure predictions at much finer scales than before (Wilkinson et al., 2024). This progress has allowed risks of PPCPs to be assessed more broadly and supported the identification of the drivers of risks in different regions of the world (Wilkinson et al., 2024). In terms of risks to terrestrial wildlife, we have an improved understanding for select PPCP classes, such as the nonsteroidal inflammatory drugs, euthanasia products, veterinary parasiticides, and estrogens, with the focus being on avian species (Bean et al., 2024). It is still questionable, however, as to whether we really have an understanding yet of the real impacts of PPCPs in the environment (Sumpter et al., 2024). For example, an evaluation of the results of current prospective risk-assessment approaches with effects data for real systems indicated that true exposure and impacts of PPCPs might still be underestimated using current regulatory risk-assessment approaches (Oldenkamp et al., 2024). Increasing concerns over the links between antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and human health have resulted in a wealth of work on the impacts of chemicals, particularly antibiotics, on resistance selection. We now have a much improved understanding of the mechanisms of selection and drivers of AMR in the environment (Manaia et al., 2024). The last decade has seen an increase in the volume of laboratory-derived data on minimal selective concentrations, concentrations shown to promote horizontal gene transfer, and the development of new methodologies to derive predicted-no-effect concentrations (PNECs) for resistance (Manaia et al., 2024; Stanton et al., 2024). The evidence that environmental exposure to PPCPs is contributing to the AMR crisis is now much stronger, with comparisons of monitoring data with PNECs indicating risks of selection in some regions, associations being found between the occurrence of PPCPs in the environment and resistance selection and human acquisition of resistance being demonstrated from some environmental settings (Stanton et al., 2024). Alongside the advances in understanding exposure, effects and risks, the risk-management landscape is now very different from 2012. Concerns over PPCP exposure in the environment are now much higher up the policy agenda, with pharmaceutical pollution now being recognized as an issue by organizations such as the United Nations Environment Programme and the World Health Organization. The European Union has recently adopted a strategic approach to pharmaceuticals in the environment (Helwig et al., 2024). Work on risk management has begun to consider the whole life cycle and to approach the problem from a one health perspective with a much wider range of strategies to manage risk being considered/explored, including better health promotion to reduce pharmaceutical use, green chemistry to design less harmful pharmaceuticals and to produce medicines with lower pollution profiles, changes in prescription practices, and improved waste and wastewater management and treatment (Helwig et al., 2024). Despite the many advances in our understanding of the impacts of PPCPs on the natural environment and how to manage them, there are still significant gaps in our knowledge; and all of the special issue papers highlight areas where more work is needed. Many of the papers stress the need for broadening the research to include a much wider range of geographical areas (Oldenkamp et al., 2024; Wilkinson et al., 2024), chemicals and chemical classes (Ankley et al., 2024; Carter et al., 2024), and species and life stages (Brooks et al., 2024). On the effects side, approaches for extrapolating from molecular-level interactions to higher levels of organization need to become more quantitative, including broader taxonomic domains of applicability (Brooks et al., 2024); and more focus needs to be placed on the functional endpoints that really matter for pollution prevention and the protection of biodiversity and ecosystem services (Brooks et al., 2024; Margiotta-Casaluci et al., 2024). Work on mixtures needs to move away from considering effects following short-term exposures of single species to considering effects of chronic exposure on food webs (Kidd et al., 2024). It is impossible to study everything, so to deliver all of this will require a more systematic approach to generate the necessary in vitro and in vivo data to support these analyses (Ankley et al., 2024; Kidd et al., 2024). Improved access to data for a range of stakeholders would help facilitate a better understanding of the environmental risks of PPCPs (Oldenkamp et al., 2024). More focus is needed on underrepresented geographies that are likely vulnerable to PPCP impacts (Oldenkamp et al., 2024). Exposure modeling efforts also need to move toward working at finer temporal resolutions and to include factors such as pH that will modify the impacts of PPCPs (Carter et al., 2024; Wilkinson et al., 2024). More use needs to be made of effects-based approaches (e.g., batteries of in vitro and in vivo methods) and in-field ecological monitoring (Oldenkamp et al., 2024). Work needs to continue to understand the role the environment plays in the risk of AMR to human health (Manaia et al., 2024). We also need to widen the work to consider the impacts of a range of non-antibiotic contaminants on levels of resistance in the environment and start to consider potential mixture interactions and risks from an AMR perspective (Manaia et al., 2024; Stanton et al., 2024). While major strides have been made in the management of the risks of PPCPs, policy in the area needs to become much stronger so that solutions are implemented more rapidly and equitably around the world. Human health needs to be better integrated into the management process, and a move to a one health approach could be highly beneficial here (Helwig et al., 2024). Work on PPCPs in the coming decade will benefit from a wide range of ""new"" methodologies that are introduced in papers in the special issue. These include citizen science to monitor PPCPs (Wilkinson et al., 2024); non-invasive monitoring tools for monitoring uptake into and effects on organisms (Bean et al., 2024); new approach methodologies that minimize the use of animals (Ankley et al., 2024; Bean et al., 2024; Langan et al., 2024); genetic modification methods, such as clustered, regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats, coupled with new imaging methods (Margiotta-Casaluci et al., 2024); omics methods (Brooks et al., 2024; Manaia et al., 2024); high-throughput experimental testing methods—for example, high-throughput absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion tests (ADME; Kidd et al., 2024; Margiotta-Casaluci et al., 2024); machine learning approaches (Carter et al., 2024; Margiotta-Casaluci et al., 2024); and other advanced modeling methods such as Bayesian physiologically based pharmacokinetic models, population-based ADME simulators, hidden Markov models, and population ecology and bioenergetic tools (Brooks et al., 2024; Manaia et al., 2024; Margiotta-Casaluci et al., 2024). The big questions identified by Boxall et al. (2012) provided fodder for a wave of international research on PPCPs in the environment. As demonstrated by the synthesis articles in this special issue, subsequent advances have been palpable, with tools and approaches developed to understand PPCPs also contributing to an improved understanding of other anthropogenic contaminants and natural toxins in environmental matrices. While the science has moved on considerably in the past decade, because of some of the knowledge gaps identified above, Sumpter et al. (2024) point out that we are still unable to answer the most important question of 2012: How important are PPCPs relative to other chemicals and nonchemical stressors in terms of biological impacts in the natural environment? This is despite the fact that over 18,000 documents are now available on the occurrence, effects, and risks of PPCPs in the environment (Sumpter et al., 2024). It would be depressing if, in 2032, we are in a similar situation. Moving forward, the research community needs to take a much more hypothesis-driven approach to address the knowledge gaps preventing us from answering this question. We hope that this special issue and the new research questions identified here (Table 2) will provide the research community with some direction and focus to this important endeavor to improve the sustainability of healthcare and personal care products. How do we prioritize pharmaceuticals for geographical regions with limited monitoring and usage data? In addition to apical endpoints, how can ecotoxicological responses such as molecular levels be utilized for PPCP prioritization? How can we include microbial communities in PPCP prioritization? Which types of species that are vulnerable to PPCPs are not considered during current prioritization approaches? What are the partitioning and sorption behaviors of strongly ionizing chemicals among species? How does membrane permeability of ions influence bioaccumulation of PPCPs? To what extent are salts and associated complexes with PPCPs influencing bioaccumulation? How do biotransformation and other elimination processes vary within and among species? Are bioaccumulation modeling efforts currently focused on chemicals and species with key data gaps and risk profiles? What are the key sources of uncertainty for PPCP bioaccumulation modeling? Can we generate a knowledge map for the functional conservation of drug targets? What is the best way to extract knowledge on comparative biology and make it usable for environmental toxicology applications? What is the quantitative relationship between subapical adverse endpoints and apical effects across species? Can we use modeling approaches to overcome the experimental (and resource) limitations of using model laboratory organisms? Can we develop a scalable battery of new approach methodologies for the characterization of uptake, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of chemicals in fish species? How can the quantity, taxonomic/species coverage, quality, and annotation of sequences improve to expand information available for comparative studies using bioinformatics and other omics approaches? What are the molecular targets of specific chemical classes, and are these targets conserved across species used in and reflected by endpoints employed during regulatory ecotoxicology testing? How can we better take advantage of combined approaches considering molecular target sequence similarity and protein structural knowledge to inform functional predictions for species extrapolation in chemical safety assessments? Which molecular targets have a quantitative relationship between evolutionary conservation and species sensitivity? What vulnerable species co-occur with contaminants in specific locations at concentrations above adverse effect thresholds that are anticipated based on cross-species extrapolation approaches? How can advances in eco-exposomics and precision exposure science accelerate development of precision ecotoxicology and its applications to improve the practice of environmental science and engineering? What are the criteria that would drive the adoption of alternative methods, model systems, and bioinformatics approaches for regulatory decision-making regarding cross-species extrapolation? How can we develop and implement a systematic approach to collect in vitro bioactivity and in vivo effects data for a greater diversity of PPCPs and taxa? How can the number of AOPs (including qAOPs) relevant to predicting the effects of PPCPs be expanded? What is needed in terms of additional knowledgebases and computational tools to efficiently conduct hazard/risk assessments for the ecological effects of PPCPs? To which API mixtures are aquatic populations and communities exposed—focusing on understanding patterns of coexposure and global exposure dynamics? Which aquatic populations and communities are most sensitive to which type of API mixture(s), considering both direct and indirect effects? How can new approach methodologies, in particular ""omics,"" be used to assess hazards and risks of API mixtures? Which mixtures might cause synergistic/interactive toxicities of APIs under environmentally realistic conditions? What is necessary to evolve the discussion and mutual understanding between developers and end users (industry/regulatory agencies) on when and how to further methods/approaches as new science or regulatory change emerges? How can potential divergence of environmental no-observed-effect concentrations be better assessed? Can variability between taxa and attributable to multiple environmental modifiers like chemical mixture effects, abiotic stressors including climate change, and biotic stressors like variable food webs be incorporated? How can knowledge about the uncertainties of traditional tests for environmental protection be better used to define benchmark criteria for the scientific and regulatory acceptance of new approach methodologies data? How can socioeconomic and geophysical ""risk factors"" for environmental exposure to PPCPs be used to prioritize monitoring in regions where PPCPs pose the greatest risk to environmental and human health? What effects will climate change have on the risks associated with PPCP exposure via the environment? Where will these effects be most significant? Can public engagement in science produce a robust and reliable identification of the risks associated with PPCP exposure to humans and the environment in regions not typically studied by the scientists or where analytical capacity is limited? How can novel analytical techniques and in silico modeling be used to make the study of PPCPs and their geographical risk gradients more accessible, accurate, and ""green""/sustainable? How can good-quality ecotoxicity data required for the risk assessment of pharmaceuticals become easily findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable for the global scientific, regulatory, and general public? How can regulatory frameworks for environmental risk assessment and management of pharmaceuticals be made fit for purpose in developing regions of the world? How can effect-based and ecological approaches be integrated into regulatory risk-assessment practice? To what extent are pharmaceuticals in the environment affecting populations and the diversity of reptiles, amphibians, and mammals? How are mixtures of antibiotics and other antimicrobials contributing to the presence of antimicrobial resistance in aquatic environments? What are the MSCs of nonantibiotic PPCPs? What are the in situ MSCs of PPCPs in the environment, and do these align with laboratory-derived MSCs? What are the effects of PPCP mixtures on selection and horizontal gene transfer in the environment? Does transmission from various underresearched natural environments result in a human health outcome? How can the issue of pharmaceuticals in the environment be integrated in a wider discussion on public and ecological health, in particular in the planetary health context? What synergies can be found between improving public health, providing value-based health and care, and reducing pharmaceuticals in the environment, acknowledging the global societal complexities of these issues? What further drivers can be put in place, in a range of global contexts, to aid the integration of the transformative changes that are achievable through cleaner environments and health promotion into strategies on pharmaceuticals in the environment?

rayyan-210759142,"Harnessing marine microbiomes to develop a sustainable, all‐Atlantic bioeconomy",,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Marine microbiomes are integral to the functioning of a healthy ocean and have the potential to be key contributors toward an all-Atlantic sustainable blue bioeconomy (Figure 1). New compounds may be developed based on these microbiomes. The Atlantic Ocean is a biodiversity hotspot. The All-Atlantic Ocean Research and Innovation Alliance (AAORIA) Declaration, signed in 2022 in Washington, DC, is a promising mechanism to move forward marine microbiome science, technology, and innovation. However, science, technology, and innovation initiatives in the South Atlantic require great attention. Here we highlight the potential, and challenges ahead, of an all-Atlantic marine microbiome initiative. Successful examples around the world are discussed, and suggestions are put forward. Microbes including bacteria, archaea, protists, and fungi represent the majority of the ocean biomass1. These microbes play a central a role in nutrient cycling, fluxes of energy, and matter in the ocean contributing to primary production and climate change mitigation2. Furthermore, long-term host–microbe co-evolution has allowed (in)vertebrates to occupy diverse niches in the ocean (e.g., the deep sea, hydrothermal vents, and coral reefs), facilitated by endosymbiotic microbes which have established stable partnerships with their hosts3. The Tara Ocean global survey demonstrated that microbial diversity is modulated by water mass parameters, such as temperature and nutrients4. More recently, the Tara Research Federation has identified a wealth of novel pico-planktonic eukaryotic primary producers inhabiting oxygen minimum zones5. Simultaneously, databases and artificial intelligence tools have been developed for mining marine microbiomes6. Some of these developments are being carried out in collaboration with the industry to expand knowledge of marine microbiomes. While there is much more to discover about marine microbiomes, we know they are important players in supporting marine food webs. We also know that their functional diversity is remarkably high and that these microbiomes are integral for a healthy ocean which may support a sustainable bioeconomy. In this context, we believe that countries bordering the Atlantic Ocean (including representatives from the Global South and North) may create meaningful partnerships to provide the investment and science innovation needed to address several of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Almost 900 million people are affected by hunger (http://wfp.org; accessed April 10, 2024). Further pressure on traditional agriculture and aquaculture practices is foreseen due to human population increase, which is estimated to approach up to 10 billion people in 2050. While aquaculture is responsible for the annual production of 88 million metric tonnes of fish, most are produced in inland (fresh) waters. Estimates suggest that <40% of the fish production is derived from marine systems (mariculture). Harvesting wild populations of marine organisms cannot sustainably provide sufficient additional food. Estimates suggest that 35.4% of stocks may be overfished as of 20197. Alternative approaches to mariculture and coastal agriculture are urgently required. These approaches may harness the diverse metabolic traits of microbial communities to augment the production of marine-derived resources8. Saline agriculture may provide a sustainable alternative to traditional coastal agriculture (https://Simbaproject.eu; https://www.thesaltdoctors.com/). These approaches contribute to sustainability by reducing the need for freshwater and by making use of less arable land. To promote saline agriculture, different initiatives have applied high-tech microbiological screening for plant growth-promoting genes from salt-tolerant microbes. These microbes may alter the root habitats or modify the plant physiology, increasing production in salt-impacted land. Microbiomes are also central for the development of low-carbon and integrated multitrophic mariculture (IMTA). These technologies focus on the developing multitrophic systems that recycle waste and reduce antibiotic use and carbon emissions8. Biofloc technology (BFT) has also been successfully applied in the shrimp aquaculture9. BFT is based on the use of microbial consortia which can serve as a food source and to remediate rearing water quality. Marine microbiomes also offer great potential for drug discovery10. Antibiotic resistance, the emergence of new diseases, and increasing cancer rates require the development of novel pharmaceuticals to address these public health challenges. Currently, there are >18,000 natural products which have been derived from the marine environments (microorganisms and macroorganisms)11. Of these, over 5000 products have been patented11. Estimates suggest that over 40,000 novel gene clusters, obtained from 35,000 microorganisms and macroorganisms, may code for highly novel bioactive molecules and enzymes. On this path, the Blue Remediomics Initiative aims to develop tools to catalog marine microbiome datasets, new medicines, cosmeceuticals, and bioproducts (https://www.embl.org/news/science/blueremediomics-harnessing-marine-microbes-to-promote-a-circular-bioeconomy/). However, some marine microbiomes remain poorly characterized. A recent initiative has put forward standard methods and best practices for marine microbiome science, technology, and innovation (STI) (https://www.frontiersin.org/research-topics/15877/marine-microbiomes-towards-standard-methods-and-best-practices). Research priorities in marine microbiomes include measuring microbiome diversity in poorly sampled regions including the deep sea and Global South, quantifying interactions between microbiota, and harnessing oceanic microorganisms to expand the bioeconomy. These insights are crucial for efforts aimed at driving policy and increasing ocean literacy4. A series of international agreements have been signed to support collaborative science in the Atlantic12 (Figure 1). A consensus outcome of the All-Atlantic Declaration is the establishment of the AAORIA to support and facilitate efforts aimed at the sustainable development of the Atlantic Ocean. The recent announcement that AAORIA will focus on two specific initiatives, one focused on climate change and the ocean and the other focused on ocean observing, might provide some potential opportunities to support marine microbiome STI across the Atlantic (https://allatlanticocean.org/news/conclusions-from-the-2023-all-atlantic-ocean-research-and-innovation-alliance-forum/). The Biotecmar (https://allatlanticocean.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Marine-Biotechnology-Initiative.pdf) and the Atlantic Ocean Research Alliance (AORA) Marine Microbiome Working Group (https://www.marinemicrobiome.org/) were launched, respectively, with a focus on biotechnology and marine microbiomes. Ongoing data collection for harnessing marine microbiomes is underway in several initiatives across the Atlantic (https://oceandecade.org/actions/observing-and-promoting-atlantic-microbiomes/; https://ocean.si.edu/ocean-life/microbes/marine-microbes; https://www.macumbaproject.eu/; https://jpi-oceans.eu/en/pharmasea; https://oceandecade.org/actions/mission-ocean-microbiomes-tara-microbiomes/; https://triatlas.w.uib.no/; https://www.bluetools-project.eu/; https://marblesproject.eu/). These projects will bring new insights into the use of marine microbiomes in bioeconomy. The European Union (EU)-lead coordinated microbiome research projects, such as Astral (https://www.astral-project.eu/) and Innoaqua (https://innoaquaproject.eu/), have provided new insights regarding ocean processes, food security, aquaculture, and how a healthy ocean is necessary for a sustainable blue bioeconomy8, 13. In addition, the strategic use of shared infrastructure has led to improved insights. For instance, the Geotraces (https://www.geotraces.org/) and the EU-funded AtlantECO (https://www.atlanteco.eu) projects have relied on the development of shared protocols to leverage expensive infrastructure across underexplored regions in the Atlantic. These efforts have led to increased research in different countries including participation by researchers in the Global South. However, more accessible marine microbiome infrastructure and human capital formation are needed, e.g., through multiuser facilities (https://schmidtocean.org/) and more target programs (http://www.coml.org/). The International Center for Deep Life Investigation at Shanghai Jiao Tong University represents one approach to supporting international collaborations (https://icdli.sjtu.edu.cn/). Multinational efforts to promote capacity building have involved Brazil, Canada, EU, South Africa, and the United States (e.g., programs Confap-EU, NSERC/Horizon). The partnership Confap-EU has engaged in mutual funding of research projects. However, matching funds from all involved countries are required, limiting participation of scientists from many all-Atlantic partner countries. A key impediment to coordinated research has been the requirement to work ""in parallel"", which has led to issues in project codesign and execution of scientific research across the Atlantic12. For instance, the projects AQUAUP and BLUEWAYSE, recently implemented under the Sustainable Blue Economy Initiative (https://bluepartnership.eu/news/partnership-decides-first-batch-co-funded-projects), aim to develop microbiome-based solutions for animal feeding and sustainable aquaculture. However, these European initiatives still lack an all-Atlantic engagement. To achieve a sustainable blue bioeconomy, we strongly advocate for the establishment of coordinated international marine microbiome research efforts across the Atlantic Ocean. A focus area on marine microbiomes, similar to what has been accomplished on climate change and ocean observing (https://allatlanticocean.org/news/conclusions-from-the-2023-all-atlantic-ocean-research-and-innovation-alliance-forum/), and a strong network including all countries across the Atlantic Ocean will require investments in human capital, infrastructure, and research. We propose the development of bidirectional exchanges to support existing and new collaborative research partnerships. These exchanges may allow the identification of specific needs including shared resources and the development of new technologies. Capacity building programs may, for instance, focus on the development of artificial intelligence, new equipment and tools, and research focused on poorly characterized regions including the deep sea and corals reefs14, 15. Artificial intelligence applied on open science resources may allow relevant discoveries of novel microbial genes16. Existing programs across the Atlantic (e.g., FULBRIGHT and PROBRAL-CAPES) could prioritize marine microbiome. Marine microbiome research requires equipment that may be complex to operate and expensive for researchers in many countries. Developing agreements to facilitate sharing of infrastructure and its associated costs may help to address these challenges. Strong efforts are needed to reduce geographical sampling biases and increase temporal scales in microbiome research. An important aspect of increasing geographical coverage of data is to ensure that the required resources including technology, infrastructure, and data are accessible through partnerships17. Overall, the All-Atlantic Declaration presents a potential opportunity to go forward. It may underpin the development of strong STI projects, which may support international and interdisciplinary marine microbiome research to benefit the blue bioeconomy for all countries in the Atlantic. However, broad engagement needs to be promoted. The needed (inter)national financial mechanisms should be based on cocreation and codevelopment. Meanwhile, new agreements that would enable truly collaborative research across the Atlantic would facilitate resource sharing, make technologies more accessible, and permit sharing of infrastructure such as equipment or ships. Furthermore, research in the South has been seriously hampered by lack of funding. Cocreation and codevelopment entails participation not only in research funding but also in science and innovation from all nations, at all levels of government. Specific funding programs that close these gaps are required, and south governments need to invest in international bilaterial and multilateral programs. Funding needs to be targeted to support research in South and Central America and Africa if an embracing network inclusive of developing countries such as Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, the Dominican Republic, Ghana, Morocco, and South Africa is to be built. Tangible long-term commitments to fund marine microbiome projects are needed particularly in developing countries. F. T. and C. T. acknowledge funding support of CAPES, CNPQ, and FAPERJ.

rayyan-210759195,Research on Image Recognition of Pandas and Bears Based on Deep Learning,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"As deep learning technology has rapidly developed in recent years, image recognition and classification have become a hotspot research direction in artificial intelligence. Accurate identification of target objects in images has great significance for practical applications like autonomous driving, medical image analysis, and biodiversity conservation. Pandas and brown bears are both endangered species of worldwide conservation concern, but manually classifying large volumes of images can be challenging, especially for applications requiring high speed and precision. This study aims to leverage the powerful capabilities of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to automatically and accurately distinguish between pandas and brown bears. CNNs can learn discriminative visual features from large labeled image datasets and have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on various image recognition benchmarks. Applying these deep learning techniques has the potential to provide a new technological solution for the panda-brown bear identification challenge, which is crucial for effective wildlife monitoring and conservation strategies. The proposed approach involves training a CNN model using a comprehensive dataset of panda and brown bear images. The model's classification accuracy and inference speed are thoroughly evaluated. The research findings are expected to contribute to enhanced scale and efficiency of field data collection for protecting these vulnerable species.","",https://doi.org/10.62051/kkbqen84,"",,
rayyan-210759226,A deep learning pipeline for time-lapse camera monitoring of floral environments and insect populations,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract Arthropods, including insects, represent the most diverse group and contribute significantly to animal biomass. Automatic monitoring of insects and other arthropods enables quick and efficient observation and management of ecologically and economically important targets such as pollinators, natural enemies, disease vectors, and agricultural pests. The integration of cameras and computer vision facilitates innovative monitoring approaches for agriculture, ecology, entomology, evolution, and biodiversity. However, studying insects and their interactions with flowers and vegetation in natural environments remains challenging, even with automated camera monitoring. This paper presents a comprehensive methodology to monitor abundance and diversity of arthropods in the wild and to quantify floral cover as a key resource. We apply the methods across more than 10 million images recorded over two years using 48 insect camera traps placed in three main habitat types. The cameras monitor arthropods, including insect visits, on a specific mix of Sedum plant species with white, yellow and red/pink colored of flowers. The proposed deep-learning pipeline estimates flower cover and detects and classifies arthropod taxa from time-lapse recordings. However, the flower cover serves only as an estimate to correlate insect activity with the flowering plants. Color and semantic segmentation with DeepLabv3 are combined to estimate the percent cover of flowers of different colors. Arthropod detection incorporates motion-informed enhanced images and object detection with You-Only-Look-Once (YOLO), followed by filtering stationary objects to minimize double counting of non-moving animals and erroneous background detections. This filtering approach has been demonstrated to significantly decrease the incidence of false positives, since arthropods, occur in less than 3% of the captured images. The final step involves grouping arthropods into 19 taxonomic classes. Seven state-of-the-art models were trained and validated, achieving F 1-scores ranging from 0.81 to 0.89 in classification of arthropods. Among these, the final selected model, EfficientNetB4, achieved an 80% average precision on randomly selected samples when applied to the complete pipeline, which includes detection, filtering, and classification of arthropod images collected in 2021. As expected during the beginning and end of the season, reduced flower cover correlates with a noticeable drop in arthropod detections. The proposed method offers a cost-effective approach to monitoring diverse arthropod taxa and flower cover in natural environments using time-lapse camera recordings.","",https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.04.12.589205,"",,
rayyan-210759246,Exploring the effects of habitat management on grassland biodiversity: A case study from northern Serbia,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Grasslands represent a biodiversity hotspot in the European agricultural landscape, their restoration is necessary and offers a great opportunity to mitigate or halt harmful processes. These measures require a comprehensive knowledge of historical landscape changes, but also adequate management strategies. The required data was gathered from the sand grasslands of northern Serbia, as this habitat is of high conservation priority. This area also has a long history of different habitat management approaches (grazing and mowing versus unmanaged), which has been documented over of the last two decades. This dataset enabled us to quantify the effects of different measures across multiple taxa (plants, insect pollinators, and birds). We linked the gathered data on plants, pollinators, and birds with habitat management measures. Our results show that, at the taxon level, the adopted management strategies were beneficial for species richness, abundance, and composition, as the highest diversity of plant, insect pollinator, and bird species was found in managed areas. Thus, an innovative modelling approach was adopted in this work to identify and explain the effects of management practices on changes in habitat communities. The findings yielded can be used in the decision making as well as development of new management programmes. We thus posit that, when restoring and establishing particular communities, priority needs to be given to species with a broad ecological response. We recommend using the decision tree as a suitable machine learning model for this purpose.","",https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0301391,"",,

This research explores the application of deep learning techniques in conjunction with appearance-based feature extraction for the automated and precise identification of fish species from images. The study employs a comprehensive dataset of underwater fish images, encompassing various species, sizes, and environmental conditions. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are used for feature extraction and classification, allowing for the capture of intricate visual characteristics that distinguish different fish species. Moreover, appearance-based features, such as colour patterns, fin shapes, and other morphological attributes, are integrated into the model to enhance classification accuracy. Additionally, the study introduces Improved Sequential Forward Selection (ISFS) as a method to select relevant features for classification, further enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of the model. The research evaluates the performance of the proposed methodology against existing classification methods, emphasizing the advantages of deep learning and appearance-based feature extraction in terms of classification accuracy, robustness, and efficiency. In addition, the study explores the potential for real-world applications in fisheries management, species monitoring, and ecological research. The findings of this research demonstrate that the combination of deep learning and appearance-based feature extraction provides a promising approach for fish species classification, offering a valuable tool for conservation efforts and ecological studies. This research contributes to the growing body of knowledge in the field of computer vision and biodiversity conservation and opens up new possibilities for automated fish species identification in aquatic environments.","",https://doi.org/10.52783/jes.2026,"",,
rayyan-210759391,Utilizing Geographical Distribution Statistical Data to Improve Zero-Shot Species Recognition,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Species recognition is a crucial part of understanding the abundance and distribution of various organisms and is important for biodiversity conservation and management. Traditional vision-based deep learning-driven species recognition requires large amounts of well-labeled, high-quality image data, the collection of which is challenging for rare and endangered species. In addition, recognition methods designed based on specific species have poor generalization ability and are difficult to adapt to new species recognition scenarios. To address these issues, zero-shot species recognition based on Contrastive Language–Image Pre-training (CLIP) has become a research hotspot. However, previous studies have primarily utilized visual descriptive information and taxonomic information of species to improve zero-shot recognition performance, and the use of geographic distribution characteristics of species to improve zero-shot recognition performance has not been explored. To fill this gap, we proposed a CLIP-driven zero-shot species recognition method that incorporates knowledge of the geographic distribution of species. First, we designed three prompts based on the species geographic distribution statistical data. Then, the latitude and longitude coordinate information attached to each image in the species dataset was converted into addresses, and they were integrated together to form the geographical distribution knowledge of each species. Finally, species recognition results were derived by calculating the similarity after acquiring features by the trained CLIP image encoder and text encoder. We conducted extensive experiments on multiple species datasets from the iNaturalist 2021 dataset, where the zero-shot recognition accuracies of mammals, mollusks, reptiles, amphibians, birds, and insects were 44.96%, 15.27%, 17.51%, 9.47%, 28.35%, and 7.03%, an improvement of 2.07%, 0.48%, 0.35%, 1.12%, 1.64%, and 0.61%, respectively, as compared to CLIP with default prompt. The experimental results show that the fusion of geographic distribution statistical data can effectively improve the performance of zero-shot species recognition, which provides a new way to utilize species domain knowledge.","",https://doi.org/10.3390/ani14121716,"",,
rayyan-210759395,Assessing habitat suitability for black grouse broods at the bioregional scale,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Mountainous regions are regarded as significant biodiversity hotspots, offering a diverse range of vital ecosystem services to the communities who reside in them and the surrounding plains. The black grouse (Lyrurus tetrix), a galliform species emblematic of the European Alps, is currently threatened by habitat change. The estimation of population dynamics, and in particular the reproductive success of this species, represents a significant challenge for the long-term conservation of the black grouse. In this study, we attempted to map black grouse brood habitat suitability (BHS) at the scale of an Alpine bioregion, coupling a species distribution model (SDM) with multi-source remote sensing data. To extract landscape composition features likely to influence BHS, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) were employed to characterise very high spatial resolution (VHSR) SPOT6-7 imagery. Altitude, phenological indices derived from Sentinel-2 time series (NDVImax, NDWI1max), and a texture feature derived from the SPOT6-7 images (Haralick entropy) were used to refine landscape characterisation. An SDM based on a random forest ensemble model was used to map black grouse BHS. Altitude, ericaceous heathland and NDVImax emerged as the three most significant variables, consistent with the ecological needs of black grouse. The proportion of ericaceous heathland was especially representative of the foraging needs of female black grouse; the main ecological determinant of habitat suitability for brood rearing with sufficient vegetation cover. This study highlights the effectiveness of integrating VHSR and multispectral time series, together with the advantages offered by deep learning techniques, in extracting species-specific information tailored to conservation issues. The BHS map, produced on a regional scale, constitutes a significant advances in the monitoring of the current population dynamics of black grouse at the western limit of the species' geographical distribution.","",https://doi.org/10.22541/au.173039591.10621475/v1,"",,
rayyan-210759499,Relation Extraction From Unstructured Species Descriptions Using TaxonNERD and LLaMA 2 7B,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Ontologies are essential tools for organizing information on taxonomy, ecology, and inter-species relationships, helping to standardize ecological data and facilitate integration of large datasets. Combining ontologies with advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, such as Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Relation Extraction (RE), has greatly improved the discovery of insights from unstructured scientific texts, particularly in biodiversity (Gabud et al. 2023, Abdelmageed et al. 2022, Hearst 1992). This study combines ontologies and NLP to analyze complex trophic interactions among animal species (Gabud et al. 2023), using a dataset (National Biodiversity Institute of Costa Rica (INBio) 2015) containing species descriptions in English and Spanish. We applied TaxoNERD to identify taxonomic entities (Le Guillarme and Thuiller 2021) and we fine-tuned the Large Language Model Meta AI (LLaMA 2 7B) to extract feeding interactions and predator-prey relationships (CheeKean 2023), due to its effectiveness in handling complex language patterns and its adaptability to diverse scientific domains. Our results (Fig. 1) showed a recall of 0.73 and a precision of 0.68, indicating that the model effectively identifies feeding relationships in most cases. However, the lower precision suggests that the model may still capture some unrelated interactions, highlighting an area for improvement to reduce false positives and increase accuracy (Touvron et al. 2023). Previous studies also emphasize the need for further refinement of relation extraction models to enhance accuracy (Mora-Cross et al. 2023). The structured dataset offers valuable insights into species’ diets and roles, contributing to biodiversity research and conservation efforts (Mora-Cross et al. 2023, Touvron et al. 2023). Moreover, this research highlights the potential of integrating AI-driven tools with ontological frameworks to manage and analyze biodiversity data at scale (Abdelmageed et al. 2022). By transforming unstructured text into structured data, we make ecological information more accessible, supporting better decision-making in conservation strategies (Abdelmageed et al. 2022, Hearst 1992). This approach scales well with the growing volume of biodiversity data, offering a more efficient and accurate method for analyzing species interactions, which are crucial for ecosystem management and endangered species protection (Gabud et al. 2023).","",https://doi.org/10.3897/biss.8.142382,"",,

Native plant pathogens thriving in natural environments significantly contribute to ecosystem structure, stability, nutrient cycling, and productivity. The coevolution of wild crop progenitors with native pathogens yields a diverse array of disease resistance factors, serving as a critical resource for farmers and breeders in developing disease-resistant cultivars. Moreover, native plant pathogens hold promise as valuable research tools, model systems for scientists, and potential sources of novel drugs, pesticides, bio-control agents, and biotechnological innovations (Ingram 1999, Ingram 2022) Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology, specifically Deep Learning (DL), is revolutionizing agricultural sustainability by advancing plant disease identification (Ayoub Shaikh et al. 2022, Wongchai et al. 2022). DL extends beyond single-crop disease identification, encompassing multiple crops and diseases (Lee et al. 2020). Utilizing computer vision and Internet of Things (IoT), AI enhances the ability to recognize and categorize plant diseases across diverse agricultural landscapes (Sinha and Dhanalakshmi 2022). The data used is crowdsourced from images captured through cameras or smartphones. However, to comprehensively monitor and understand plant diseases on a larger scale for diversity study, AI practitioners should integrate broader factors into their predictive modeling such as weather patterns, geographical variations, environmental conditions, and real-world challenges. Overcoming real-world challenges involves addressing previously unseen diseases, modeling disease distribution across extensive geographical areas, and managing domain adaptation, which arise from differences in data distributions between the source and target domains. An innovative plant disease identification framework has been established, benchmarked on the largest plant disease dataset (Mohanty et al. 2016). This framework specifically focuses on addressing the crucial challenges in this field. The reliability of DL models was thoroughly analyzed and evaluated through machine vision interpretation, and cases lacking labeled data were explored (Chai et al. 2023). This presentation will not only highlight the significant advancements achieved but also outline future plans to new ecological studies of plant diseases identification as indispensable elements in the broader landscape of global environmental change research.","",https://doi.org/10.3897/biss.8.133055,"",,
rayyan-210759785,NicheFlow: Towards a foundation model for Species Distribution Modelling,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract 1. Species distribution models (SDMs) are crucial tools for understanding and predicting biodiversity patterns, yet they often struggle with limited data, biased sampling, and complex species-environment relationships. Here I present NicheFlow, a novel foundation model for SDMs that leverages generative AI to address these challenges and advance our ability to model and predict species distributions across taxa and environments. 2. NicheFlow employs a two-stage generative approach, combining species embeddings with two chained generative models, one to generate a distribution in environmental space, and a second to generate a distribution in geographic space. This architecture allows for the sharing of information across species and captures complex, non-linear relationships in environmental space. I trained NicheFlow on a comprehensive dataset of reptile distributions and evaluated its performance using both standard SDM metrics and zero-shot prediction tasks. 3. NicheFlow demonstrates good predictive performance, particularly for rare and data-deficient species. The model successfully generated plausible distributions for species not seen during training, showcasing its potential for zero-shot prediction. The learned species embeddings captured meaningful ecological information, revealing patterns in niche structure across taxa, latitude and range sizes. 4. As a proof-of-principle foundation model, NicheFlow represents a significant advance in species distribution modeling, offering a powerful tool for addressing pressing questions in ecology, evolution, and conservation biology. Its ability to model joint species distributions and generate hypothetical niches opens new avenues for exploring ecological and evolutionary questions, including ancestral niche reconstruction and community assembly processes. This approach has the potential to transform our understanding of biodiversity patterns and improve our capacity to predict and manage species distributions in the face of global change.","",https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.10.15.618541,"",,
rayyan-210759823,Traits for Efficient Navigation and Search in Natural History Collections,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"The application of AI methods is increasingly fueling research in biodiversity. One of the objectives of the French national e-COL+ project is to enable collections to benefit from the innovative contributions of image recognition and text mining. The preceding e-ReColNat project aimed to centralize all the images and data from natural history collections on a single platform (Pérez and Pignal 2013). Despite this abundance of collection-related visual media, the options available for exploring them are currently limited to the usual metadata, such as the name of the species, or the place and date of collection. AI methods offer the promise of better usability (see Ariouat et al. 2023) by extracting characteristics linked to specimens and taxa, known as traits. To go further, it is essential to identify some potential traits that AI models can be trained to recognize. To this end, scientists and curators with expertise in different taxa and conservation techniques were consulted. The taxonomic knowledge of the interviewees covers botany, zoology and paleontology. Their expertise encompasses different types of collections, such as fossils, thin sections, herbarium sheets, alcohol-preserved and dry specimens (Table 1). Some of the traits mentioned are specific to individual specimens, including visible polymorphic morpho-anatomical characteristics, such as the shape of a leaf. Another possible category of traits is related to the specific preservation state of the specimen, such as early traces of pyrite rot (see Larkin 2011) in fossils. The last main category of traits at the specimen level focuses on the presence or absence of elements or organs such as traces of soil, flowers or seeds on a plant, as a way to filter relevant specimens for given studies. These traits can be efficiently extracted using computer vision models, which are trained using corpora assembled by experts. Other traits can be deduced from species-level descriptions. These include broader characteristics than those mentioned above, such as invisible morpho-anatomy at the level of the specimen, such as the potential size of a tree. The ecology, phenology, spatial distribution and relationships with humans were also cited. Natural language processing (NLP) artificial intelligence techniques are used to extract these traits (Sahraoui et al. 2022). There is a synergy between the two AI approaches: taxon-level traits identified through text mining can also be used to train computer vision models, improving their ability to recognize these traits in images. This link between traits and species makes it possible to automatically annotate corpora on a large scale. The main issue that emerged during the interviews was the vocabulary. As an example, the notions of ‘toothed’ or ‘denticulate’ to describe a leaf margin are difficult to strictly differentiate. Moreover, some collections at the Muséum national d'Histoire naturelle (MNHN) need an upstream improvement of their current metadata (missing or weak taxonomic identification, database populating in progress), before AI-derived data can be implemented effectively. In conclusion, by systematically identifying and extracting traits relevant to navigation and search from a vast array of images, the e-Col+ project enhances the usability of French collections. Collaboration between scientists, curators and AI experts ensures the robustness and usefulness of the project's outcomes, paving the way for innovative research and application.","",https://doi.org/10.3897/biss.8.134816,"",,

rayyan-210760202,"Applying the maximum entropy principle to multi-species neural networks
  improves species distribution models",,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"The rapid expansion of citizen science initiatives has led to a significant growth of biodiversity databases, and particularly presence-only (PO) observations. PO data are invaluable for understanding species distributions and their dynamics, but their use in Species Distribution Models (SDM) is curtailed by sampling biases and the lack of information on absences. Poisson point processes are widely used for SDMs, with Maxent being one of the most popular methods. Maxent maximises the entropy of a probability distribution across sites as a function of predefined transformations of environmental variables, called features. In contrast, neural networks and deep learning have emerged as a promising technique for automatic feature extraction from complex input variables. In this paper, we propose DeepMaxent, which harnesses neural networks to automatically learn shared features among species, using the maximum entropy principle. To do so, it employs a normalised Poisson loss where for each species, presence probabilities across sites are modelled by a neural network. We evaluate DeepMaxent on a benchmark dataset known for its spatial sampling biases, using PO data for calibration and presence-absence (PA) data for validation across six regions with different biological groups and environmental covariates. Our results indicate that DeepMaxent improves model performance over Maxent and other state-of-the-art SDMs across regions and taxonomic groups. The method performs particularly well in regions of uneven sampling, demonstrating substantial potential to improve species distribution modelling. The method opens the possibility to learn more robust environmental features predicting jointly many species and scales to arbitrary large numbers of sites without an increased memory demand.","",https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2412.19217,"",,
rayyan-210760246,"Trees, society, and the path toward resilient ecosystems",,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Over 3 trillion trees occupy the Earth's land surface, mostly in tropical and subtropical forests. These trees provide vital ecosystem services, such as climate regulation, carbon sequestration, and habitat and food provision. Trees are also deeply interconnected with humans, offering social and cultural values. The interdependence between trees and humans underlines the urgency to understand and protect trees in both natural and urban ecosystems amid climate change and other environmental pressures, including deforestation, land degradation, and pollution. This virtual issue examines five critical themes of trees and forests and their societal impact. Over 3 trillion trees occupy the Earth's land surface, mostly in tropical and subtropical forests (~1.3 trillion) (Crowther et al., 2015). These trees provide vital ecosystem services, such as climate regulation, carbon sequestration, and habitat and food provision (Brockerhoff et al., 2017; Myers, 1997). Trees are also deeply interconnected with humans, offering social and cultural values (O'Brien, 2005). The interdependence between trees and humans underlines the urgency to understand and protect trees in both natural and urban ecosystems amid climate change and other environmental pressures, including deforestation, land degradation, and pollution (De Marco et al., 2022; Esperon-Rodriguez, Tjoelker, et al., 2022; Kumar et al., 2022; Lindner et al., 2010). This virtual issue examines five critical themes of trees and forests and their societal impact. Each theme provides insights into cultural significance, ecosystem contributions, resilience and restoration, and technological innovations in conservation. In 'Climate Resilience and Adaptive Strategies of Trees', researchers investigate how trees adapt to climate change through resilience and genetic diversity with studies on urban forest adaptation, genetic variation, and seasonal responses of tree species. 'Forest Restoration and Biodiversity Conservation' shows strategies that enhance biodiversity and climate mitigation with diverse reforestation practices. In 'Trees and Human Culture', the research explores the cultural value of trees, focusing on the historical and societal importance of native and commercial species and their role in local traditions and economies. The authors of work featured in 'Trees as Ecosystem Engineers' highlight how trees contribute to biodiversity and support livelihoods, with studies on societal perceptions, species interactions, and endemic conservation efforts. Lastly, 'Technological Advances in Forest Monitoring and Conservation' delves into tools like UAVs and genetic analyses that aid in monitoring and preserving forests. Together, these themes offer a comprehensive view of trees' essential roles across ecosystems, human culture, and emerging conservation efforts. As a response to climate change and urbanization, researchers highlight the need to enhance urban forest resilience. Urban forests, essential for decreasing urban heat and improving air quality and human well-being (Keeler et al., 2019), face risks from climate-induced stress. To secure the provision of these benefits to urban residents, Esperon-Rodriguez, Rymer, et al. (2022) emphasize the importance of selecting tree species suited to the projected climate conditions in cities along with other desirable characteristics, such as aesthetic value and biodiversity support. By assessing the risks to heat, drought, and pest outbreaks, urban planners can make informed decisions to increase the longevity of urban trees and secure the services they provide (Esperon-Rodriguez, Rymer, et al., 2022). Urban environments present unique challenges and opportunities for tree resilience. Sjöman et al. (2024) examined how genetic diversity within tree species (i.e., intraspecific variation) supports resilience to urban stresses, such as pollution and limited water availability. The authors suggest that by focusing on resilient tree varieties, urban forestry initiatives can improve biodiversity and ecosystem function within cities, fostering healthier urban landscapes that also contribute to climate resilience. Species, however, respond differently to local environmental conditions. For example, Goessen et al. (2022) explored how tree species have diverse adaptations driven by geographic conditions. Their study focused on Populus tremuloides, or Quaking aspen, a species native to North America, has developed divergent strategies in response to local environmental constraints, reflecting the role of genetic diversity in resilience. In Japan, Miyawaki-Kuwakado et al. (2024) investigated how warming temperatures affect the timing of seasonal events like bud dormancy. Their research on the iconic Yoshino cherry tree (Cerasus × yedoensis) showed that climate change may lead to mistimed flowering. Such shifts threaten species reliant on specific climatic triggers, raising concerns about the long-term viability of temperature-sensitive species in changing climates. Importantly, these changes can also have socio-economic disruptions, as the blossoming of cherries is an important tourism resource (Murata et al., 2012). Similar results were found in the Singapore Botanic Gardens, where Ho et al. (2024) conducted a long-term assessment of changes in leafing behavior of tropical trees in response to climate change. They found that tropical trees can adjust their leafing behavior over extended periods, showcasing their adaptive capacity. By focusing on adaptive capacity, genetic diversity, and optimal species selection, this research offers pathways to enhance forest resilience and sustain the ecological and social benefits that trees provide. Forest restoration plays a critical role in climate change mitigation and biodiversity conservation as global efforts aim to reverse deforestation and land degradation (Bastin et al., 2019). Andres et al. (2023) sought to define the term ""biodiverse reforestation"" and explained why this matters for climate change mitigation and biodiversity. The authors emphasize the importance of integrating biodiversity goals into reforestation efforts. By prioritizing species diversity, reforestation projects can sequester carbon more effectively while supporting ecosystem functions and species. This represents a more resilient and sustainable approach to forest restoration. Importantly, the authors consider the potential for improving scientific approaches to biodiverse reforestation with First Nations perspectives. The co-benefits of Indigenous knowledge and values have been recognized as vital to climate adaptation (Nursey-Bray et al., 2022). In restoration, ensuring water efficiency in seedlings is crucial, especially under climate stress. Krishnan et al. (2023) examined how organic nitrogen can enhance water-use efficiency in tropical tree seedlings. They showed that nutrient addition allowed seedlings to establish more effectively under dry conditions, suggesting practical strategies for forest restoration projects in arid regions. This has important repercussions not only for restoration but also for food production. For example, in regions where food security and forest health are closely linked, selecting appropriate tree species is essential. A study in Burkina Faso, West Africa, by Vinceti et al. (2022) explored how tree species contribute to both ecological restoration and local nutrition. By including species that provide food, like fruit-bearing trees, reforestation initiatives in Burkina Faso can address both environmental and community needs, creating landscapes that support biodiversity while improving food security. Local and small-scale efforts, such as home gardens, also play a significant role in supporting biodiversity and for conservation. Offord and Zimmer (2024) studied how home gardeners help preserve the critically endangered Wollemi Pine (Wollemia nobilis). This species native to Australia was described as new to science in 1994 and is represented by fewer than 100 individuals (Trueman et al., 2007). By cultivating Wollemi Pine in private gardens, individuals contribute to broader conservation goals, ensuring genetic diversity and supporting efforts to reintroduce the species into its natural habitat (Offord & Zimmer, 2024). This approach highlights the value of community-based conservation in supporting endangered species and enhancing biodiversity. Trees and forests have profound cultural and economic value, reflecting centuries of human interaction and local knowledge (O'Brien, 2005). Recent research investigates the cultural, economic, and social significance of tree species, focusing on the importance of identity, naming, and preservation of species. Dunbar-Wallis et al. (2023) highlight the significance of preserving historic North American apple (Malus domestica) varieties. Their study showed how naming and identifying these apples maintain cultural heritage and biodiversity. North American apples represent historical practices and tastes, underscoring the importance of preserving these genetic resources as part of local identity and resilience. Notably, M. domestica is one of the most cultivated fruits worldwide (ranked fourth) with an average annual production of over 85 million tons globally (FAOSTAT, 2020). For the wild apple (Malus sylvestris), Ruhsam et al. (2023) took the challenge of accurately identifying the nursery stock sold in nurseries from the United Kingdom. Wild apple species are vital for genetic diversity and resilience, and ensuring authenticity in nursery stock is crucial for conservation. This research highlights the importance of preserving genetic integrity and maintaining access to wild species, which are valuable for both biodiversity and cultural heritage. Studying a culturally significant species, the barnī date palm variety, a local elite variety of al-'Ulā oasis in Saudi Arabia, Gros-Balthazard et al. (2023) found that this variety is not only an economic staple but also a cultural icon in the region. Through its name and cultivation, the barnī date palm represents a rich heritage that has sustained communities for generations, illustrating how plant varieties can embody place-based knowledge and cultural ties. In a similar study, Gurung et al. (2024) explored the cultural and medicinal significance of Buddleja asiatica, a shrub native to the East Indies. In the Pan-Himalayan region, this species is integral to local healthcare practices, providing essential medicinal benefits to communities. Its use reflects a traditional knowledge system and highlights the symbiotic relationship between people and native plant species, demonstrating the role of trees in supporting cultural identity and local health. Trees as ecosystem engineers (i.e., organisms responsible for the creation and maintenance of habitats; Jones et al., 1996) can change the abiotic context upon which biotic interactions depend (Byers et al., 2006). Thus, community livelihoods rely on identifying threats and benefits provided by trees. Tsvuura et al. (2023) explored gender perspectives on the perceived benefits and threats of tree restoration in South Africa. They explored how communities view trees as valuable contributors to their livelihoods, recognizing the critical role trees play in providing resources such as timber, fruit, and medicinal products. However, this study also highlights concerns regarding threats to these benefits, such as climate change, deforestation, and urbanization. These threats challenge the sustainability of the services that communities depend on, underscoring the need for strategies that secure tree resources while balancing conservation and economic needs (Sivakumar et al., 2024). In Yemen, Maděra et al. (2024) studied 11 endemic frankincense tree (Boswellia) taxa in the Socotra Archipelago. These species are culturally and economically valuable to local communities. However, frankincense trees are also threatened by overharvesting, habitat loss, and climate change, threatening local biodiversity and the communities reliant on them for livelihood. Maděra et al.'s study provides a detailed ecological assessment identifying regions at most risk and offers insights into conservation strategies that balance sustainable use with the preservation of genetic diversity. The conservation of frankincense trees is critical not only for the ecosystem but also for supporting traditional practices and economic stability for people in the region. As hosts for other species, trees can develop complex interactions, such as the relationship between strangler figs and their host trees, studied by Mo et al. (2024). Strangler figs start life on host trees, gradually growing and often overtaking the host tree's structure. While this interaction may seem parasitic, it can enhance urban green spaces by adding unique biodiversity and aesthetic value. This study suggests that, when managed properly, strangler figs can enrich urban ecosystems by creating microhabitats for multiple species, supporting urban biodiversity, and improving the resilience of green spaces (Mo et al., 2024). This research highlights the dual ecological and cultural significance of these trees in urban landscapes. Modern technologies like AI, UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles), and genetic tools are shaping a new era in the conservation, management, and monitoring of forests worldwide. By combining UAV surveys, genetic analysis, advanced forestry tools, and ground-based monitoring, researchers and managers can make informed decisions about forest conservation and sustainable use. These technologies not only improve our understanding of forest ecosystems but also facilitate enforcing regulations, planning conservation strategies, and adapting to climate change impacts on forests. In Madagascar, Williams (2024) used UAVs to monitor deforestation in real-time. Madagascar harbors a unique biodiversity, but this is threatened by illegal logging (Ralimanana et al., 2022). UAVs enable rapid, cost-effective detection of deforestation, offering precise data on forest loss and allowing authorities to respond promptly to illegal activities (Williams, 2024). In a global review of emerging tools to support sustainable forestry, Bunney et al. (2023) focused on protecting sandalwood species (a variety of species in the family Santalaceae), which are culturally and economically valuable and threatened by overharvesting. This review examined different methods, including DNA barcoding, to verify the species of harvested wood and remote sensing for forest monitoring. Together, these studies demonstrate the importance of combining drones, remote sensing, and genetic tools for comprehensive forest conservation strategies. The role of genomics in understanding the resilience of tree species was studied by Kong et al. (2023). Prosopis alba, native to arid environments, possesses genetic traits that allow it to withstand extreme drought and saline conditions. By mapping the genome of P. alba, Kong et al. demonstrated species adaptability, which can inform breeding programs aimed at enhancing the resilience of trees in regions facing water scarcity and climate stress. Genomic tools enable targeted conservation of tree species that are vital to ecosystem stability in extreme climates (Isabel et al., 2020). Finally, in a study using ground-based data, Anderson-Teixeira et al. (2024) showed that effective forest carbon inventories require precise measurements of carbon stocks. Technologies such as remote sensing paired with field data can provide reliable estimates. This approach enhances the accuracy of reporting forest carbon, helping countries meet their climate goals and track the effectiveness of conservation efforts. Collectively, these studies show the essential roles that trees play in both natural and urban environments, particularly in the face of climate change and environmental pressures. They reveal how trees adapt to climate changes, underscoring the importance of genetic diversity and adaptive strategies to strengthen climate-resilient forestry. This knowledge supports informed species selection and management to foster resilient forests that benefit both ecosystems and communities. A multi-faceted approach to forest restoration, one that incorporates ecological, cultural, and social factors, emerges as crucial for sustaining biodiversity while meeting community needs. These studies highlight trees as cultural symbols and economic resources, essential for preserving cultural identity and biodiversity. Trees also serve as ecosystem engineers, offering ecosystem services that support biodiversity, air quality, and water regulation, while facing significant threats from human impact. Notably, technological advancements and emerging tools are transforming forest conservation and monitoring, providing researchers with tools to better protect and manage forest ecosystems. Together, these studies provide insights and innovations toward more sustainable and resilient ecosystems that benefit both the environment and society. MER wrote this article.

rayyan-210760394,"Reliable and superior elliptic Fourier descriptor normalization and its
  application software ElliShape with efficient image processing",,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Elliptic Fourier analysis (EFA) is a powerful tool for shape analysis, which is often employed in geometric morphometrics. However, the normalization of elliptic Fourier descriptors has persistently posed challenges in obtaining unique results in basic contour transformations, requiring extensive manual alignment. Additionally, contemporary contour/outline extraction methods often struggle to handle complex digital images. Here, we reformulated the procedure of EFDs calculation to improve computational efficiency and introduced a novel approach for EFD normalization, termed true EFD normalization, which remains invariant under all basic contour transformations. These improvements are crucial for processing large sets of contour curves collected from different platforms with varying transformations. Based on these improvements, we developed ElliShape, a user-friendly software. Particularly, the improved contour/outline extraction employs an interactive approach that combines automatic contour generation for efficiency with manual correction for essential modifications and refinements. We evaluated ElliShape's stability, robustness, and ease of use by comparing it with existing software using standard datasets. ElliShape consistently produced reliable reconstructed shapes and normalized EFD values across different contours and transformations, and it demonstrated superior performance in visualization and efficient processing of various digital images for contour analysis.The output annotated images and EFDs could be utilized in deep learning-based data training, thereby advancing artificial intelligence in botany and offering innovative solutions for critical challenges in biodiversity conservation, species classification, ecosystem function assessment, and related critical issues.","",https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2412.10795,"",,
rayyan-210760489,"Generalization in birdsong classification: impact of transfer learning
  methods and dataset characteristics",,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Animal sounds can be recognised automatically by machine learning, and this has an important role to play in biodiversity monitoring. Yet despite increasingly impressive capabilities, bioacoustic species classifiers still exhibit imbalanced performance across species and habitats, especially in complex soundscapes. In this study, we explore the effectiveness of transfer learning in large-scale bird sound classification across various conditions, including single- and multi-label scenarios, and across different model architectures such as CNNs and Transformers. Our experiments demonstrate that both fine-tuning and knowledge distillation yield strong performance, with cross-distillation proving particularly effective in improving in-domain performance on Xeno-canto data. However, when generalizing to soundscapes, shallow fine-tuning exhibits superior performance compared to knowledge distillation, highlighting its robustness and constrained nature. Our study further investigates how to use multi-species labels, in cases where these are present but incomplete. We advocate for more comprehensive labeling practices within the animal sound community, including annotating background species and providing temporal details, to enhance the training of robust bird sound classifiers. These findings provide insights into the optimal reuse of pretrained models for advancing automatic bioacoustic recognition.","",https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2409.15383,"",,
rayyan-210760661,Habitat niches of bird species along a recovery gradient in the Chocó tropical forest,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Conservation programs need improved tools to measure the recovery of animal diversity across restoration gradients. We used soundscapes and expert identifications of bird species to calculate niche position (i.e., mean of environmental conditions across all areas a species occupies) and niche breadth (i.e., the standard deviation of the species distribution) along a recovery gradient; from agriculture to early (up to 20 yrs) and late (up to 38 yrs) recovery, to old-growth forests. Our survey included 323 bird species and was conducted in 66 plots in the lowland Chocoan tropical rainforest in Ecuador where less than 11% of the forest remains intact, and large areas are currently undergoing regeneration post-abandonment. First, we validated our niche metrics by contrasting them against independent global categories of forest density dependency. We then explained the niche metrics of the bird species with different ecological traits, gathered from the literature, reflecting species-specific primary diet, morphology and distribution, and accounting for the phylogenetic relatedness of species. Finally, we explored the phylogenetic signal present in bird species' ecological traits and recovery niche metrics. Niche position and breadth across the recovery gradient closely followed global categories of forest density dependency. However, our approach provided a more fine-scaled sorting of bird species in forest plots categorized as late recovery and old-growth. Granivorous birds occupied niche positions in active cacao and pasture plots and were replaced by frugivorous birds in older regeneration plots. Along the recovery gradient, tail length and handwing index decreased with niche position, supporting previous observations that birds in old-growth forests are less mobile. Birds in old-growth forests had smaller global distribution ranges than birds in agricultural plots. Finally, the latitudinal distribution of birds in the study area averaged south of the equator, with birds in old-growth plots averaging latitudinal centroids in wet forests north of the equator, whereas birds in agriculture plots averaged latitudinal centroids further south of the country, towards the dry and open Tumbesian forest. Frugivores, invertivores and vertivores had broader niche breadths, but these decreased (marginally) with tail length. We suggest these recovery niche metrics as a potentially powerful tool for the rapid assessment of the recovery process, which might support conservation strategies such as biodiversity credits, compensation payments, and strategic land purchases. With the increasing availability of information-intensive models for bird species identification, such as deep learning artificial intelligence, our new niche metrics open the avenue for rapid assessment of tropical biodiversity and new conservation areas at larger scales.","",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2024.112260,"",,
rayyan-210760671,"Deep learning-based ecological analysis of camera trap images is
  impacted by training data quality and size",,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Large wildlife image collections from camera traps are crucial for biodiversity monitoring, offering insights into species richness, occupancy, and activity patterns. However, manual processing of these data is time-consuming, hindering analytical processes. To address this, deep neural networks have been widely adopted to automate image analysis. Despite their growing use, the impact of model training decisions on downstream ecological metrics remains unclear. Here, we analyse camera trap data from an African savannah and an Asian sub-tropical dry forest to compare key ecological metrics derived from expert-generated species identifications with those generated from deep neural networks. We assess the impact of model architecture, training data noise, and dataset size on ecological metrics, including species richness, occupancy, and activity patterns. Our results show that while model architecture has minimal impact, large amounts of noise and reduced dataset size significantly affect these metrics. Nonetheless, estimated ecological metrics are resilient to considerable noise, tolerating up to 10% error in species labels and a 50% reduction in training set size without changing significantly. We also highlight that conventional metrics like classification error may not always be representative of a model's ability to accurately measure ecological metrics. We conclude that ecological metrics derived from deep neural network predictions closely match those calculated from expert labels and remain robust to variations in the factors explored. However, training decisions for deep neural networks can impact downstream ecological analysis. Therefore, practitioners should prioritize creating large, clean training sets and evaluate deep neural network solutions based on their ability to measure the ecological metrics of interest.","",https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2408.14348,"",,
rayyan-210760688,The Benefit of Coralline Algae Science to Elevate Ocean Literacy,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Marine habitats will face a growing number of pressures in the coming decades because of anthropogenically induced climate change, ocean warming and ocean acidification, biodiversity shifts and overexploitation (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 2023). Effective engagement of scientific research beyond academia is crucial for maximising the resilience of nature to these global challenges (Herbert-Read et al. 2022). Ocean literacy is a fundamental first step towards global marine science education, research and effective conservation of ecologically important ecosystems (Santoro et al. 2017; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 2013). Here, we provide some examples (not an exhaustive list) of recent outreach initiatives across multiple media types that were designed to elevate public knowledge about coralline algae—globally distributed calcified red seaweeds—and their associated habitats, known as coralline algae reefs, maerl beds or rhodolith beds. Placed within the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission of UNESCO (IOC/UNESCO) Ocean Literacy Framework (Santoro et al. 2017) and aligned to the seven 'Essential Principles of Ocean Literacy' (Box 1), we show that coralline algae are an excellent basis for elevating ocean literacy at local, regional and global scales and transcending diverse public groups. An ocean-literate person understands the Essential Principles and Fundamental Concepts about the ocean; can communicate about the ocean in a meaningful way; and is able to make informed and responsible decisions regarding the ocean and its resources. Principle 1: Earth has one big ocean with many features. Principle 2: The ocean and life in the ocean shape the features of Earth. Principle 3: The ocean is a major influence on weather and climate. Principle 4: The ocean makes Earth habitable. Principle 5: The ocean supports a great diversity of life and ecosystems. Principle 6: The ocean and humans are inextricably interconnected. Principle 7: The ocean is largely unexplored. Coralline algae are present in all the ocean basins with global distribution. Public engagement centred around coralline algae therefore opens up the opportunity for bringing in global scale ocean literacy concepts. In 2022, Costa et al. published an accessible introduction to rhodoliths in the journal Frontiers for Young Minds (Figure 1a)—an alternative academic journal that includes children as peer reviewers and input from mentors and teachers. This paper provides an accessible introduction to rhodoliths, targeted towards younger audiences (but with relevance for all ages), engaging participation in the scientific process from a young age and inspiring the next generation of scientists. Key concepts and terminologies were introduced, such as the importance and implications of their global distribution, with local context of searching for 'redstones' or 'rhodoliths' at the beach, how coralline algae act as 'bioengineers', their role in 'blue carbon' and the importance of conserving these unique habitats for future prosperity. We suggest that through increasing the number of popular science articles about coralline algal research, it is possible to bolster the public understanding of the occurrence and global significance of coralline algal habitats. Encouraging widespread distribution of these articles via social media and other outlets will enable coordinated global scale reach. Marine science documentaries can inspire, educate and transform complex scientific concepts and serve to be informative tools in science communication (Staaterman et al. 2014). Biogenic maerl beaches are geologically significant, with rhodoliths found frequently in Cenozoic deposits and through the formation of recent sedimentological micro-habitats such as maerl subaqueous dunes (mega-ripples) as well as biogenic gravel beaches composed of fossilised maerl debris (Freiwald 1995; Joshi 2016). Therefore, they have proven to be a useful example to illustrate Principle 2—where biology and geology meet. The Trá an Doílín beach in county Galway, Ireland, is popularly known as the 'Coral Strand' in the local community and frequently mistaken to be composed of coral, not coralline algae. To elevate coralline algae ocean literacy and to preserve local knowledge previously unrecorded, Dr Siddhi Joshi led the direction and production of an hour-long documentary 'Maerl: A Rare Seabed Habitat'. In this, focusing on Ireland's maerl beds, the documentary covered a diverse range of multidisciplinary maerl research spanning botany, zoology, habitat mapping, conservation management, geology, hydrographic surveying and geophysics (Joshi and Documentary Team 2014; Figure 1b). Through a series of interviews with coralline algae/maerl experts, this documentary was able to show how stakeholders and coastal communities are affected by anthropogenic activities that target maerl bed, including commercial extraction, dredging, salmon farming and bottom trawling, now freely available on the 'Seabed Habitats' collaborative research blog (seabedhabitats.org). Through a film screening on Aran Island in county Galway, west of Ireland (at Inisheer Film Festival), the film helped raise local awareness of the presence and conservation significance of maerl, in light of a previous salmon farm proposal in a neighbouring local area. Attendees included local fishermen and conservation groups, tourists and marine scientists. Another locally significant maerl documentary is 'Pink Maerl and Salmon Farms– Scotland's Barrier Reef' (Little Green Island Films 2023), inspired by the rising citizen science movement to protect maerl beds in Scotland (Hall-Spencer and Rasmusson 2024; Figure 1c). Receiving more than 2000 views from around the world, these video documentaries have given regional coralline algal science a global public platform. Biogeochemistry can be easily left behind in public engagement by not being as charismatic or broadly understood as other topics like biodiversity (Sutton et al. 2013). However, their known importance as a globally important pool of dimethylated sulphur (Burdett, Hatton, and Kamenos 2015) has been showcased in public settings, including in a headline talk by Dr Heidi Burdett at the 2019 New Scientist Live—one of the largest science festivals in the world with more than 40,000 attendees, mostly of school age (Figure 1d). Dimethylated sulphur is important for weather and climate because of the role it may play in local-regional climate regulation through the stimulation of cloud formation (Hopkins et al. 2023). The longevity of coralline algae and the complexity of their calcium carbonate skeleton means they are excellent recorders of past climate, allowing us to reconstruct Holocene environmental change and identify the impacts of human activity. Research led by Dr Branwen Williams on Arctic coralline climate reconstruction has been featured by National Geographic, with a video on YouTube (link here) that has received 46,000 views from around the world (Figure 1e; Williams, personal communication). Marine photosynthesis supports almost all ocean life, and coralline algae have been recorded at deeper depths than any other alga in the ocean (Gattuso et al. 2006). The extraordinary ability for coralline algae to photosynthesise under a huge range of light environments has been a recent research focus (e.g., Krieger et al. 2023; Voerman et al. 2023; Voerman et al. 2022). However, photosynthesis—especially in the ocean—can be an abstract concept to understand. Since 2019, Dr Heidi Burdett in collaboration with Dekko Comics (dekkocomics.com) has used science comics as a medium to start conversations and increase knowledge about coralline algal photosynthesis. Drawing on the known benefits of science comics with visual design, narratives and metaphors (Farinella 2018), more than 6000 copies of this comic have been distributed around the world (as of May 2024) in schools, museums, music festivals, and more (Figure 1f). Known to increase engagement, learning motivation and improve understanding of STEM subjects, science comics are a valuable but underexplored genre in science communication. Scientific illustrations have also been suggested by rhodolith researchers in Costa Rica to help communicate the importance of rhodoliths to different age groups and to rangers of marine protected areas (MPAs), so they can identify rhodoliths in their conservation areas. The group is actively involved in talks to university students, courses for the nonscientific population about algae where this topic is included, as well as education for tourism companies so they can recognise the beds and the ecosystem services they provide (Fernández García, personal communication). Coralline algal habitats are one of the ocean's most biodiverse ecosystems (Tuya et al. 2023). They therefore present an opportunity to showcase Nature's biodiversity beyond the more commonly targeted ecosystems such as coral reefs or rainforests. Art–science collaboration, such as Julia Barton's maerl-themed 'Littoral Art Project' and performance exhibition (littoralartproject.com), is one novel example which utilised dance as an art-form to communicate the diversity of coralline algae ecosystems. Using personifications of a crab, sea cucumber and octopus to artistically explore the maerl habitat, the threats of anthropogenic activities such as dredging and the 'sanctuary' can be provided by MPAs. Marine citizen science is a growing method for improving ocean literacy and has now reached out to coralline algae. In Scotland, for example, citizen science initiatives via Seasearch (www.seasearch.org.uk) have helped to increase biodiversity records on maerl beds and improve conservation policy compliance (Hall-Spencer and Rasmusson 2024). Maerl is a celebrated commodity in some parts of the world. For example, the 'Fête du maerl' cultural festival takes place every 4 years in Brittany with more than 5000 attendees. Historically, maerl was used as a soil conditioner for treating acidic soils in the region; extraction of maerl from the seabed therefore had the dual benefit of supporting fertile agricultural land and a fishing industry (Figure 1g). Over time then, maerl has had an inextricable link to human socioeconomic and cultural values that continues to live on in conservation initiatives and museum exhibitions (e.g., Óceanopolis aquarium in Brest; www.oceanopolis.com/en). At a global scale, coralline algae have also been a leading feature of local initiatives around the world within the Global Seaweed-SUPERSTAR Project (https://globalseaweed.org/). For example, the project has capacity-building initiatives in Tanzania, Malaysia and the Philippines to improve seaweed (including coralline algae) taxonomic identification skills in the local community and to identify diseases. These efforts are communicated via policy briefs and guidance videos for publics and industry. Despite their ecological, biogeochemical, socioeconomic and cultural importance and global ubiquity, coralline algae and their associated habitats remain poorly studied (Tuya et al. 2023). Even now, our knowledge about their distribution remains patchy. Public engagement with coralline algae citizen science initiatives hold promise for scaling-up our exploration and distributional recording of coralline algae habitats (Hall-Spencer and Rasmusson 2024). This can be further facilitated by public networks such as the Irish Ocean Literacy Network (irishoceanliteracy.ie) and combined ocean mapping-outreach initiatives such as the 'Real Map of Ireland'—which showcases the tremendous progress we have made in recent years to map our ocean floors and identify new habitats such as maerl beds. Through participation in international conferences (COLACMAR, SOFILAC), data on rhodolith beds in Costa Rica have been translated into maps showing conservation gaps at the national level. This helps to additionally augment the research efforts studying fossil and recent rhodoliths from Central America (Caribbean and Pacific), with the aim of identifying the main species (from a morphological and genetic perspective), analysing their historical biogeography, describing their development environments and generating conservation recommendations (Fernández García, personal communication). Embracing emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence is crucial if coralline algae science is to keep pace with other disciplines. It is here where innovation in coralline algal public engagement can build on its foundation, looking forward to our next generation of coralline algal scientists, conservationists, policymakers and advocates. A first step towards this can be seen in the NASA NeMO-Net videogame (van den Bergh et al. 2021; nemonet.info; Figure 1h) where seabed classification (of, for example, coral reefs and coralline algae) feeds into a neural network to progress and improve habitat mapping. In this citizen science for the digital age, users are trained in seabed classification on virtual dives by a Remotely Operated Vehicle. Having reached more than 300 million people within 7 months of launch (van den Bergh et al. 2021), it is clear that digital engagement holds great potential for widespread engagement in both ocean and technology literacy. We hope to see more innovations in this space with particular emphasis on co-creating with educators' materials, resources and information. Most people only engage with the ocean through the visual of the flat ocean surface, suggesting calm and nothingness underneath (Williams, personal communication). Visualising the ocean as a three-dimensional or more dynamic four-dimensional changing environment is therefore of crucial importance and may be achieved using emerging technologies such as ocean digital twins—a current multimillion Euro priority for the European Commission (European Commission 2022). Activities that highlight how complex the ocean is and integral to our earth science is important. This is done particularly well through engaging storytelling, including high-quality visuals—several examples of which we have highlighted here. Language and illiteracy barriers should be overcome through translation of resources to local language(s) and a focus on non–text-based engagement materials. Coralline algae-specific resources are sparse compared to other habitats and species—here we demonstrate that redressing this balance can help us to advance local–global ocean literacy. Permissions are granted for the use of images in Figure 1, where necessary. The authors would like to thank Cindy Fernández García and Branwen Williams for their contributions to the global examples included for the ocean literacy principles and two anonymous reviewers for improving the quality of the final manuscript.

rayyan-210760904,The FAIR-Device - a non-lethal and generalist semi-automatic Malaise trap for insect biodiversity monitoring: Proof of concept,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract Field monitoring plays a crucial role in understanding insect dynamics within ecosystems. It facilitates pest distribution assessment, control measure evaluation, and prediction of pest outbreaks. Additionally, it provides important information on bioindicators with which the state of biodiversity and ecological integrity in specific habitats and ecosystems can be accurately assessed. However, traditional monitoring systems can present various difficulties, leading to a limited temporal and spatial resolution of the obtained information. Despite recent advancements in automatic insect monitoring traps, also called e-traps, most of these systems focus exclusively on studying agricultural pests, rendering them unsuitable for monitoring diverse insect populations. To address this issue, we introduce the Field Automatic Insect Recognition (FAIR)-Device, a novel non-lethal field tool that relies on semi-automatic image capture and species identification using artificial intelligence via the iNaturalist platform. Our objective was to develop an automatic, cost-effective, and non-specific monitoring solution capable of providing high-resolution data for assessing insect diversity. During a 26-day proof-of-concept evaluation, the FAIR-Device recorded 24.8 GB of video, identifying 431 individuals from 9 orders, 50 families, and 69 genera. While improvements are possible, our device demonstrated potential as a cost-effective, non-lethal tool for monitoring insect biodiversity. Looking ahead, we envision new monitoring systems such as e-traps as valuable tools for real-time insect monitoring, offering unprecedented insights for ecological research and agricultural practices.","",https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.03.22.586299,"",,
rayyan-210760938,Acoustic detection rate can outperform traditional survey approaches in estimating relative densities of breeding waders,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Passive acoustic devices are increasingly being used to monitor biodiversity. However, few studies have compared the accuracy of acoustic surveys and traditional surveys against ground‐truthed data. Here, we assess whether acoustic recorders used in conjunction with an artificial intelligence (AI) classifier can predict the relative breeding density of four wader species better than traditional fieldworker transect surveys. In a 27‐km 2 upland study site, acoustic data were collected at 83 sampling points and analysed using the BirdNet bird‐sound classifier to estimate vocal detection rate at each location; we also carried out concurrent transect bird surveys. To ground‐truth these approaches, intensive field surveys were undertaken to identify each breeding territory of our focal species. With both the acoustic dataset and the transect dataset, we used similar analytical approaches (random forest regression trees) to predict relative territory density across the study site, and then compared these predictions with the territory density obtained from the intensive field surveys. The classifier performed well at identifying the presence of target species' vocalizations within 3‐s periods for Lapwing (accuracy = 0.911), Curlew (0.826) and Oystercatcher (0.841), but less well for Golden Plover (0.699). For Curlew and Oystercatcher, the predictions obtained from the acoustic approach were a better fit to actual territory density than the transect approach. In contrast, for Lapwing and Golden Plover, the transect predictions outperformed the acoustic predictions, with the acoustic model particularly poor for Golden Plover. We attributed these differences to the performance of the classifier, species' ecology and vocal behaviour. Data gathering for the acoustic approach was more time‐efficient than the transect surveys, requiring less than a quarter of the fieldworker days. We conclude that there is high potential for acoustic approaches to augment traditional methods, although species' ecological characteristics should be considered: species that vocalize more frequently, at higher amplitudes and hold larger territories will be better‐suited to sampling‐based acoustic methods.","",https://doi.org/10.1111/ibi.13375,"",,
rayyan-210761011,MiTREE: Multi-input Transformer Ecoregion Encoder for Species Distribution Modelling,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Climate change poses an extreme threat to biodiversity, making it imperative to efficiently model the geographical range of different species. The availability of large-scale remote sensing images and environmental data has facilitated the use of machine learning in Species Distribution Models (SDMs), which aim to predict the presence of a species at any given location. Traditional SDMs, reliant on expert observation, are labor-intensive, but advancements in remote sensing and citizen science data have facilitated machine learning approaches to SDM development. However, these models often struggle with leveraging spatial relationships between different inputs -- for instance, learning how climate data should inform the data present in satellite imagery -- without upsampling or distorting the original inputs. Additionally, location information and ecological characteristics at a location play a crucial role in predicting species distribution models, but these aspects have not yet been incorporated into state-of-the-art approaches. In this work, we introduce MiTREE: a multi-input Vision-Transformer-based model with an ecoregion encoder. MiTREE computes spatial cross-modal relationships without upsampling as well as integrates location and ecological context. We evaluate our model on the SatBird Summer and Winter datasets, the goal of which is to predict bird species encounter rates, and we find that our approach improves upon state-of-the-art baselines.","",https://doi.org/10.1145/3687123.3698297,"",,
rayyan-210761043,Standardizing marine habitat modelling practices to enhance inter-comparability across biological observations,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"ABSTRACT In recent years, the volume of accessible marine pelagic observations has increased exponentially and now incorporates a wealth of new data types, including information derived from metagenomics and quantitative imaging. This calls for standardized modelling protocol across taxonomically harmonized observations, to better predict biogeographic patterns in space and time, and thus investigate marine ecosystem structure and functioning on a macroecological scale. In this context, we introduce CEPHALOPOD (Comprehensive Ensemble Pipeline for Habitat modelling Across Large-scale Ocean Pelagic Observation Datasets), a standardized and flexible framework to perform multi-species marine habitat modelling across data types and data sources. We built this new framework on observational data from federating initiatives such as AtlantECO, OBIS, GBIF, associated with already existing statistical and machine learning methods that enable to extract and model information from heterogeneous, scarce, and biased field observations. Here, we first document our statistical ensemble modelling approach and then assess its strength and limitations with a virtual ecologist approach. We show how our framework performs in reproducing a range of distributions from biased field samples. Then, we illustrate its performance and comparability across data types by investigating the global diversity patterns of coccolithophores from both abundance and metagenomic data. Our modelling framework serves as a foundation for the consistent generation of Essential Biodiversity and Ocean Variables (EBVs and EOVs) and carries the potential to significantly advance our comprehension of biodiversity and marine ecosystems functioning. Finally, it provides an unprecedented opportunity to foster collaborations in the field of marine science, sustainable ecological practices, and, ultimately, contribute to the preservation of global marine biodiversity.","",https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.09.02.610745,"",,
rayyan-210761070,Semi-supervised learning advances species recognition for aquatic biodiversity monitoring,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Aquatic biodiversity monitoring relies on species recognition from images. While deep learning (DL) streamlines the recognition process, the performance of these method is closely linked to the large-scale labeled datasets, necessitating manual processing with expert knowledge and consume substantial time, labor, and financial resources. Semi-supervised learning (SSL) offers a promising avenue to improve the performance of DL models by utilizing the extensive unlabeled samples. However, the complex collection environments and the long-tailed class imbalance of aquatic species make SSL difficult to implement effectively. To address these challenges in aquatic species recognition within the SSL scheme, we propose a Wavelet Fusion Network and the Consistency Equilibrium Loss function. The former mitigates the influence of data collection environment by fusing image information at different frequencies decomposed through wavelet transform. The latter improves the SSL scheme by refining the consistency loss function and adaptively adjusting the margin for each class. Extensive experiments are conducted on the large-scale FishNet dataset. As expected, our method improves the existing SSL scheme by up to 9.34% in overall classification accuracy. With the accumulation of image data, the improved SSL method with limited labeled data, shows the potential to advance species recognition for aquatic biodiversity monitoring and conservation.","",https://doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2024.1373755,"",,
rayyan-210761344,BioEncoder: a metric learning toolkit for comparative organismal biology,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Abstract In the realm of biological image analysis, deep learning (DL) has been a transformative force. Tasks like finding areas of interest within an image (segmentation) and/or sorting images into groups (classification), can now be automated and achieve unprecedented efficiency and accuracy. However, conventional DL methods are challenged by large-scale biodiversity datasets, which are characterized by unbalanced classes and small phenotypic differences between them. Here we present BioEncoder, a user-friendly toolkit for metric learning, which overcomes the aforementioned challenges by focussing on learning relationships between individual data points rather than on the separability of classes. This approach simplifies training of robust image classification models for biologists, democratizing access to advanced DL techniques. BioEncoder is encapsulated in a Python package, crafted for ease of use and flexibility across diverse datasets. It features taxon-agnostic data loaders, custom augmentation options, and streamlined hyperparameter adjustments through text-based configuration files. The toolkit’s significance lies in its potential to unlock new possibilities in biological image analysis - from phenomics and disease diagnosis to species identification and ecosystem monitoring. BioEncoder focuses on the urgent need for toolkits bridging the gap between complex DL methodologies and practical applications in biological research.","",https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.04.03.587987,"",,
rayyan-210761394,Ecological features facilitating spread of alien plants along Mediterranean mountain roads,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Invasive alien species represent a major threat to global biodiversity and the sustenance of ecosystems. Globally, mountain ecosystems have shown a degree of resistance to invasive species due to their distinctive ecological features. However, in recent times, the construction of linear infrastructure, such as roads, might weaken this resistance, especially in the Mediterranean basin region. Roads, by acting as efficient corridors, facilitate the dispersal of alien species along elevation gradients in mountains. Here, we investigated how the ecological features and road-associated disturbance in native plant communities affected both the occurrence and cover of alien plant species in Central Apennines (Italy). We implemented the MIREN road survey in three mountain transects conducting vegetation sampling in plots located both adjacent to and distant from the roads at intervals of ~ 100 m in elevation. We then used community-weighted means of Ecological Indicator Values for Europe together with Disturbance Indicator Values applied to plant species of native communities as predictors of alien species occurrence and cover in a machine-learning classification and regression framework. Our analyses showed that alien species' occurrence was greater in proximity to the road where high soil disturbance occurred and in warm- and light-adapted native communities. On the other hand, alien species cover was more strongly related to moderate grazing pressure and the occurrence of nitrophilic plant communities. These findings provide a baseline for the current status of alien plant species in this Mediterranean mountain region, offering an ecological perspective to address the challenges associated with their management under global change.","",https://doi.org/10.1007/s10530-024-03418-y,"",,
rayyan-210761400,Can we harmonize the monitoring of plants and pollinators?,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Pollution, climate change, and shrinking habitats are driving major changes in flowering plant and pollinator populations. These include shifts in local abundance, population extirpations, range shifts, altered community composition, and reshuffled interactions. To date, evidence for these changes mostly reflect opportunistic efforts to collect occurrence data to document distributions. Coarse-scale perspectives on biodiversity change can be invaluable, especially when threats to rare habitats are widely distributed, but many changes occur slowly (decades) at such scales. Opportunistic occurrence data are therefore generally less useful for detecting short-term trends and monitoring the effectiveness of conservation policies. They are also typically biased for large-scale surveillance monitoring (Boyd et al., 2022) and rarely encompass both plants and pollinators, limiting our ability to estimate broad and fine-scale trends in populations and plant–pollinator interactions. Ecologists often prefer using plot-based methods for systematic surveys and monitoring, as these provide quantitative data on abundance and distributions. Resurveying such plots adds a time dimension, greatly enriching our understanding of how species abundances and distributions shift in response to drivers of global change. Monitoring and resurvey data remain scarce, leaving pictures of ecological conditions and change uncertain. Except for Switzerland and the UK, countries are slow to support systematic programs to monitor plants and pollinators. The 23–24 May Paris symposium on 'New solutions to monitor plants, pollinators and their interactions in a changing world' brought scientists together to assess the state of plant and pollinator monitoring schemes in Europe and to ponder how these might be improved, extended, and coordinated (https://www.college-de-france.fr/fr/agenda/colloque/nouvelles-approches-pour-le-suivi-des-plantes-des-pollinisateurs-et-de-leurs-interactions-dans-un). This group met to review existing schemes, compare the trends and indicators they produce, and outline future needs for research and policy. These needs include expanding the number of plots, species and habitats monitored, the different methods (e.g. by citizen scientists) and how frequently they are surveyed; how to identify and locate plants and insects quickly and reliably (including new technologies); how best to coordinate plant and pollinator sampling; and statistical tools to integrate heterogeneous data and infer causal relationships. Efforts to monitor plants include six schemes launched between 2001 and 2017 that range from regional to national in scope (Fig. 1), plus two international resurvey initiatives with the earliest observations in 1927. These programs share the following: (1) a plot-based design focused on vascular plants; (2) regular resurveys of these plots (at variable frequencies); (3) standardized protocols for collecting data on abundance or frequency; and (4) success in documenting systematic changes in plant abundances, diversity, and/or community composition. Many plant species show declining abundance (e.g. National Plant Monitoring Scheme (NPMS): unpublished; ReSurveyEurope: Jandt et al., 2022), but threatened plants in Northeastern Spain show high stability (Garcia et al., 2021). Population increases and declines are associated with climate change (especially 'thermophilization' – Vigie-flore: Martin et al., 2019; forestREplot: Zellweger et al., 2020), eutrophication (Biodiversity Monitoring Switzerland (BDM): Roth et al., 2013; North America: Clark et al., 2019), and biotic homogenization (BDM: Buehler & Roth, 2011). Plant–animal interactions also alter plant communities. The impacts of herbivory have long been documented; declines in animal-pollinated plants are another apparently widespread, but more recently observed, phenomenon (North America: Wiegmann & Waller, 2006; Novana: Ehlers et al., 2021; BDM: Abrahamczyk et al., 2022; Vigie-flore: unpublished). Although the symposium identified some common changes in diversity across Europe, differences also exist among countries that deserve investigation. Some of them may reflect the lack of a common monitoring system across Europe, as well as other intrinsic biases in design or implementation (e.g. nonrandom distributions of volunteers in space and over time). To supplement our symposium, we organized a survey to collect additional data on European plant monitoring schemes (https://mnhncesco.limesurvey.net/985853?lang=en). This was intended to facilitate a more complete comparison of how schemes vary in spatial, temporal, and ecological coverage and the use of volunteer vs professional staff. The resulting review should highlight conspicuous gaps in monitoring and suggest guidelines to improve existing and proposed monitoring schemes. These guidelines will likely include needs for geographical representativeness, stratification in sampling, ways to include rare species or habitats, and statistical methods to characterize change. Monitoring wild pollinators is even less frequent across most of Europe, reflecting in part their impressive diversity (2138 species of bees, 496 butterflies, 913 hoverflies, plus thousands of uncounted moths, flies, wasps, and beetles). Relatively few specialists exist for many of these groups, and entomological citizen science efforts are more difficult or impossible. Monitoring schemes exist in a few countries (e.g. the UK), but overall, we have few data on abundance except for butterflies. We thus lack trend data for most pollinators and pollination services across the EU, especially in southern and eastern Europe where basic knowledge is lacking even for well-studied groups. However, the symposium was encouraged to learn that a standardized EU pollinator monitoring scheme (EU-PoMS) is under development to overcome current knowledge gaps. The EU's new (2024) Nature Restoration Law may provide an opportunity to implement EU-PoMS. Assuming adequate plant and pollinator monitoring can be implemented, it will still be necessary to link these efforts to document shifts in plant–pollinator interactions. Coordinated joint plant–pollinator monitoring schemes would help us understand how plants affect pollinators and vice versa. In this regard, it was encouraging to learn of the 'Spipoll' program that seeks to document plant–pollinator interactions using large numbers of volunteers' photographs collected according to a standardized protocol. Spipoll data have already been used to characterize how specialized pollinators tend to avoid urban areas (Deguines et al., 2016). Additional programs designed to monitor both plant and insect populations at shared locations would further enhance our ability to detect changes in plant–pollinator interactions. The diversity of goals, methodologies, and data structures among the reviewed programs makes it clear that it will be difficult or impossible to standardize data collection procedures across countries and monitoring schemes. Instead, we might usefully seek to construct a modeling framework to extract similar key information from different data types. In particular, it may be possible to link programs using different types of data at different frequencies and spatial scales using rarefaction and latent variables to capture changes over time and space. Similar hierarchical models have been used elsewhere to extract information from different data types (NPMS: Pescott et al., 2019). For these efforts to succeed, we need to focus on a few key concepts, such as changes in abundance over time, to investigate the combined datasets. Visual analysis techniques to detect and identify species have improved significantly in recent years. They may enable us to improve monitoring programs by automating some aspects of species identification, data entry, and validation. Advancing sensor and analysis (AI) technologies have reduced costs while enhancing capabilities, allowing these technologies to be applied to smaller and more active animals (e.g. pollinators) and diverse small herbaceous species embedded within other vegetation. Photographic traps could be used to detect and monitor insects at flowers and quantify interactions. So far, efforts to identify plant species have mainly used close-up images of flowers and/or leaves. Newer efforts use massive visual learning data derived from citizen science platforms such as iNaturalist (https://www.inaturalist.org) or Pl@ntNet to continually improve accuracy and reliability (Joly et al., 2016). New deep-learning models (e.g. vision transformers) allow new types of analysis (Elvekjaer et al., 2024). Field workers may soon take high-resolution quadrat images (Fig. 2) for subsequent analysis by self-supervised learning models to generate data on species frequency and cover. Eventually, autonomous drones or ground vehicles equipped with cameras might lower costs enough to allow regular systematic monitoring of large areas, greatly enhancing our ability to monitor ecological change. However, care must be taken to keep botanists and citizens in the field, to maintain their knowledge and connection with nature, as well as to collect reference data that are necessary to validate new technologies. Structured monitoring schemes, especially when linked together, can generate sensitive indicators to detect changes in abundance and early-warning signals of impending extirpations. When these efforts are consistent, extensive, and extended over time, they also provide opportunities to test which environmental factors most likely drive these changes (e.g. by using 'natural experiments' that exploit spatial variation in environmental conditions). Consistent and continued monitoring programs are also essential to assess whether public policies and programs are meeting their goals. The EU's new Nature Restoration Law aims to restore at least 20% of the EU's land and sea areas by 2030 and all ecosystems needing restoration by 2050. Harmonized plant monitoring initiatives across Europe along the lines of EU-PoMS would provide a key tool for assessing its success. Coordinating these programs at the international scale will facilitate comparisons among temperate regions, increasing our ability to describe changes and infer causes. It would also serve as a useful model for monitoring ecological change in other biogeographical regions, including the tropics.

rayyan-210761462,<scp>AVOTREX</scp>: A Global Dataset of Extinct Birds and Their Traits,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"ABSTRACT Motivation Human activities have been reshaping the natural world for tens of thousands of years, leading to the extinction of hundreds of bird species. Past research has provided evidence of extinction selectivity towards certain groups of species, but trait information is lacking for the majority of clades, especially for prehistoric extinctions identified only through subfossil remains. This incomplete knowledge potentially obscures the structure of natural communities, undermining our ability to infer changes in biodiversity across space and time, including trends in functional and phylogenetic diversity. Biases in currently available trait data also limit our ability to identify drivers and processes of extinction. Here we present AVOTREX, an open‐access database of species traits for all birds known to have gone extinct in the last 130,000 years. This database provides detailed morphological information for 610 extinct species, along with a pipeline to build phylogenetic trees that include these extinct species. Main Types of Variables Contained For each extinct bird species, we provide information on the taxonomy, geographic location, and period of extinction. We also present data on island endemicity, flight ability, and body mass, as well as standard measurements of external (matching the AVONET database of extant birds) and skeletal morphology from museum specimens where available. To ensure comprehensive morphological data coverage, we estimate all missing morphological measurements using a data imputation technique based on machine learning.

rayyan-210761482,Climate challenges: can plants adapt in time?,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"The Earth's climate has continuously fluctuated throughout its recent history, with many of the most significant changes linked to changing levels of atmospheric CO2 and other greenhouse gases such as N2O and CH4 during cycles of glacial and interglacial periods (roughly every 100 thousand years since the Mid-Pleistocene). However, the current rise in CO2 is mainly due to human activities and is unprecedented in both its speed and concentration, now exceeding 400 ppm which is well above the ~ 300 ppm seen in the interglacial periods before anthropogenic pollution. This rapid increase in CO2 levels is far beyond what organisms have experienced over the last million years and poses serious challenges to their existence and functioning.While plants thrive under rising CO2 levels (Ainsworth and Long 2021), rapid and continuous warming consequent to greenhouse gases accumulation could push the Earth into a ""hothouse"" state (Steffen et al. 2018). Rising temperatures, along with concurrent stresses such as prolonged or recurrent droughts and soil salinization, threaten global agricultural productivity, and food security.Organism enduring permanent or recurrent stresses associated with climate change may: a) adapt to the stress; b) migrate to areas more suitable for growth and reproduction, or, in absence of any of these two responses, c) undergo extinction.Plants are sessile organisms. They can migrate through trans-generation seed dispersal, but this process is very slow, limited, and inefficient. Despite observed migration of plant communities in response to warming climates many plants have limited options for migration. Moreover, only migration at speeds greater than one km per year would allow plants to successfully escape the impacts of climate change, as suggested by Corlett and Westcott (2013). The success of the plant migration strategy to cope with climate change is therefore clearly limited.Eliminato: 1 Plants possess the ability to adapt to a wide range of environmental conditions due to their phenotypic plasticity. However, the phenotypes of plants also react rather slowly to environmental pressures. Indeed, any environmental change needs to be sensed first by plants, subsequently activating transcriptional, post-transcriptional or even epigenetic regulatory mechanisms. Those responses lead to phenotypic changes associated with improved tolerance and/or resilience, or with the capacity to escape incoming stress. Is this fast enough to cope with the current pace of climate warming? Previous studies cast doubts on this capacity (Loarie et al. 2009;Ostra et al. 2018). Indeed, a fundamental assumption of paleoecology has been that the rate of evolution is far slower than the rate of current climate change and the faster it occurs, the more extreme phenotypes in populations will likely be lost (Davis et al. 2005) (Figure 1).Additionally, farming might have eroded the capacity for high phenotypic plasticity of agricultural (domesticated) plants. For example, breeding exclusively for high productivity selects for traits that enhance crop yields (e.g. shorter stems, increased fruit and seed size or production). At the same time, it selects against other traits that positively influence plant survival, such as the synthesis of secondary metabolites, including phenolics, which reduce growth and/or produce antinutrients). As a result, plants loose crucial adaptation strategies, leaving them more vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, and to the loss of biodiversity.To allow plants to effectively and timely adapt to climate change may require a ""help"" from our side. In their Frontiers in Science lead article, Palmgren and Shabala (2024) discuss current knowledge about the possibility of reintroducing lost traits from wild relatives of cultivated plants (re-wilding) or, alternatively, of de novo domestication of wild plants.However, adaptation to abiotic stresses by re-wilding plants probably requires re-introduction Eliminato: plants' capacity to keep pace with current 62 changes of a suite of genes, as tolerance to abiotic stresses is a complex trait, entailing activation of multiple metabolic pathways. This is unlikely to result in the fast help that is required. In fact, taking on board the case of plant adaptation to salinity as highlighted in Palmgren and Shabala (2024), and despite considerable progress in understanding plant responses to salt stress, breeding of salt-tolerant cultivars has progressed slowly. Even when salt-tolerance genes have been identified, we have not yet been able to produce commercially relevant salttolerant varieties (Hu and Schmidhalter 2023).Driving accelerated domestication could present a more promising and practical technology for developing plants that can adapt better to climate change. Today, around thirty domesticated species account for a significant portion of dietary diversity, with only three principal cereal grains (rice, wheat, and maize) contributing to more than half of the calories intake worldwide (FAO, 2010). Thousands of edible species have been left out in the course of plant domestication; yet these underutilized species might hold the potential to transform our food systems toward being more nutritious, sustainable, and resilient to climate change (Ray et al. 2020).There are numerous suitable candidates for domestication among wild relative species, especially when stress-related tolerance has already successfully evolved in nature (e.g. in halophytes). However, domestication today often requires conversion of wild plant species into crops not only viable but also producing high yields (Rozema and Flowers 2008). It is unclear whether this goal will be successfully met as any step toward setting final yields (e.g. successful seed germination or propagation, resistance to plant diseases, positive response to farming practices such as harvesting) needs to be tested, and this, if achievable, may require time. Even when domestication of wild relatives can be successfully carried out, will the new crops meet farmers' and consumers' expectations? Tolerance of abiotic stressors often leads High-throughput phenotyping, in particular, has previously been a bottleneck, slowing the selection of suitable plant material for breeding and monitoring resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses. However, significant progress has been made in plant phenotyping by taking advantage of new technologies that merge new sensors availability (especially optical sensors) with robotics and artificial intelligence applications (Watt et al. 2019). Today, plant phenotyping is the main tool scientists use to non-destructively characterize plantenvironment interactions over the plant's lifetime, and breeders use it for high-throughput selection of desirable genotypes for specific traits. However, the massive volume of plant phenotyping data needs harmonization and powerful statistical tools to be useful in the rapid selection of adapted plants.There are other biotechnological tools helping with increasing plants' capacity to adapt to fast changing environments. For example, genomic selection promises to overcome problems experienced when applying marker-assisted selection to select for quantitative traits controlled by multiple genes, such as those involved in climate change adaptation (Budhlakoti et al. 2022). Other technologies, such as directed evolution, may speed up retrieval and insertion of resistance traits, with microbial assistance (Gionfriddo et al. 2019).Significant progress might come from improved knowledge of plant interaction with soil and airborne microorganisms. This emerging field benefits from great advances in microbial genomics, plant-microbe interactions, and the resulting changes in plant physiology and phenotypes. These developments hold great potential for enhancing plant adaptation to changing environments.As a final point, it is important to note that developing crops without accounting for their need to cope with environmental stresses may not be the most effective strategy for future agriculture. While farming practices strive to provide conditions that minimize stress to maximize growth and yield, climate change is expected to exacerbate environmental stresses and crop yield losses, and resources such as water and fertilizers are increasingly limiting plant production (Rezaei et al. 2023). Moreover, farming marginal lands has important economic, environmental, and social consequences, e.g. fighting desertification and migrations of environmental refugees. Finally, secondary metabolites that plants need to selfdefend against stresses, such as many antioxidants and pigments, have positive nutritional properties (Gionfriddo et al. 2019). Thus, breeding plants that successfully cope with stresses can also make our food safer and healthier. The figure, adapted from Davis et. al. (2005) shows changes in phenotypic means and optimal fitness means of populations of a plant species along a climate gradient under (A) a stable climate, (B) a changing climate, and (C) a rapidly changing climate. While optimal conditions follow the shift in the climate gradient, mean phenotypes are unable to follow; the more rapid the shift in climate change is, the more individual of a population will be under a condition favoring their extinction.Note from the Editorial office: publishing this figure will depend on reproduction permission from Davis et al.'s original publisher.","",https://doi.org/10.3389/fsci.2024.1522649,"",,

We investigated a novel approach using smartphone-based 3D scanning for non-destructive, high-resolution monitoring of above-ground plant biomass. This method leverages Structure from Motion (SfM) techniques with widely accessible smartphone apps and subsequent computing to generate detailed ecological data. By implementing a streamlined pipeline for point cloud processing and voxel-based analysis, we enable frequent, cost-effective, and accessible monitoring of vegetation structure and plant community biomass. Conducted in long-term experimental grasslands, our study reveals a high correlation (R² up to 0.9) between traditional biomass harvesting and 3D volume estimates derived from smartphone-generated point clouds, validating the method's accuracy and reliability. Additionally, results indicate significant effects of plant species richness and fertilization on biomass production and volume estimates, underscoring the potential for high-resolution temporal and spatial analyses of vegetation dynamics.

rayyan-210761490,From theory to practice: New innovations and their application in conservation biology,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Evolution has generated an extraordinary diversity of life on Earth that drives the function of natural ecosystems (Xu et al., 2020), human cultures (Clark et al., 2014), and economies (Hanley and Perrings, 2019; Paul et al., 2020). Plants are the most dominant life form on Earth (Bar-On et al., 2018) and the decline of plant diversity has caused drastic shifts in natural ecosystems (Pugnaire et al., 2019), resulting in a loss of hundreds of billions of dollars (USD) per year from the global economy (Austin et al., 2020; Diagne et al., 2021). Plant species face unprecedented challenges to their survival, growth, and reproduction due to numerous threats, including anthropogenic factors such as land-use change, habitat destruction, climate change, and illegal poaching (IUCN, 2023). The most urgent threats vary by region and species; thus, addressing individual threats to species survival worldwide will require broad knowledge of plant organismal function, ecology, and evolution and the creation of innovative, targeted tools and applications. This special issue features new techniques and approaches across multiple disciplines (from molecules to ecosystems) and scales of inquiry (from individual plants to global perspectives), with a central focus on the development and dissemination of new methods and perspectives in conservation biology. Conservation biologists and practitioners around the globe are conducting research and enacting policies to conserve and preserve plant diversity at the local and regional scales. One primary obstacle to the conservation of plant diversity at larger scales has been the lack of tools that directly aid the coordination of research efforts and knowledge from around the world. Linsky et al. (2024) present a new collaborative framework called the Global Conservation Consortia (GCC). Under this framework, researchers and practitioners are united by a shared focus on a specific ecological or taxonomic group (e.g., trees, cycads, magnolias, oaks) to develop comprehensive conservation action plans that scaffold efforts across local, regional, and global scales. While gathering and collating data from around the globe has historically been a challenge, a new tool hosted by the Botanic Gardens Conservation International (BGCI), reported here by Quintana et al. (2024), aims to close knowledge gaps on the conservation status of threatened tree species across regions, increase collaboration, and provide information to decision-makers. The Conservation Action Tracker, part of the GlobalTree Portal, gathers information about the current status of threatened species, action/recovery plans, ex situ collections, species protections, and policy and outreach programs. This online database is freely available so that it can be used to guide conservation efforts and monitor their success. It allows for comparisons between different species and regions, and importantly, highlights the areas where conservation efforts are deficient. Large-scale databases and collaborative networks like GCC and BGCI are key developments that can improve the effectiveness of species knowledge dissemination among conservation researchers and practitioners. A main goal of conservation networks like the GCC and BGCI is to create and expand metacollections of living plants that are of high conservation value. The preservation of wild diversity in ex situ (meta)collections is one of the most effective tools in conservation biology. Thus, understanding the extent to which current collection practices capture the biological diversity of wild populations is critical to their effectiveness, and strategies to improve the diversity represented in ex situ collections are of extreme interest to conservation biologists and practitioners alike. Linan et al. (2024) describe an effective approach to assess the genetic diversity of ex situ and in situ individuals of the tropical tree Karomia gigas, of which fewer than 100 individuals remain on Earth. Using a genetic approach, the authors were able to determine the relative proportion of individuals that share kinship and thus better inform breeding and outcrossing approaches to preserve the genetic diversity of ex situ collections. Similarly, Rosenberger and Hoban (2024) used computer simulations to understand better the contribution of propagule dispersal and population structure to the distribution of genetic diversity among maternal individuals. These empirical and theoretical data demonstrate the importance of understanding the diversity of ex situ populations relative to in situ populations to improve the effectiveness of ex situ (meta)collections for preserving extant plant species. One of the most effective practices for reversing diversity loss is species and/or habitat restoration, which is often performed with source material from ex situ collections. However, many restoration efforts are unsuccessful, and improving the success of restoration efforts could transform conservation practices broadly. Prakash et al. (2024) demonstrate the importance of considering source population genetic diversity when maximizing outplanting diversity and evolvability in Picea rubens, a declining forest tree in eastern North America. By integrating genomic data, field experiments, and boots-on-the-ground conservation, the authors demonstrate a positive association between combined source populations of outplanted individuals, early-life fitness, and evolvability. Despite advances made in conservation research, there is a current gap in sharing the outcomes of restoration efforts of plants due to a disconnect between conservation research and conservation practice. Bellis et al. (2024) introduce a database of reintroductions within the United States, called the Center for Plant Conservation Reintroduction Database (CPCRD), to enable the sharing of restoration efforts and their progress and outcomes. The CPCRD collaboration offers great promise to facilitate better management decisions by restoration practitioners, as well as encourage scientific engagement by providing a long-term database. A primary limitation for restoration practitioners working in seed-plant systems is collecting and identifying seeds of both rare and common species. Currently available methods are expensive and time-consuming, using either expensive machines that can separate size- or shape-specific seeds one at a time, or the time of highly skilled individuals. Multi-year projects also often introduce user error if the same individuals are not responsible for sorting each season. Reek et al. (2024) tested a novel way to sort conifer seeds using image recognition and machine learning. After training their model on a set of conifer seeds, they validated it against manual identification and found it to be similar in accuracy. This new method of seed counting was more efficient and, if it can be applied to other species, will provide time and cost savings in conservation efforts to monitor the seed availability of various species. Predicting extinction risk and possible future changes to various aspects of species' biology (e.g., distribution, phenology, reproductive success, physiological performance, gene expression) before they require intensive restoration efforts has become a cornerstone of conservation biology research. For example, the Evolutionarily Distinct and Globally Endangered (EDGE) and EDGE2 metrics are two recent approaches that integrate extinction risk and the evolutionary distinctiveness of geographic areas to identify conservation priorities. Pizzardo et al. (2024) compared the performance of these metrics with more traditional metrics (e.g., phylogenetic diversity) to determine conservation prioritization using a tropical legume clade (Chamaecrista ser. Coriaceae) found in the Brazilian campo rupestre ecosystem. While EDGE and EDGE2 both incorporate extinction risk, Pizzardo et al. draw attention to their requirement for complete phylogenetic data, which may be unrealistic for data-deficient regions or taxonomic groups. In contrast to broad-scale approaches that rely on phylogenetic diversity to identify conservation priorities, species distribution models (SDMs) are commonly used to predict potential changes in species ecology and distribution into the future. Evolving the use of these models by integrating different types of geographic, biological, and historical data is a core aim in conservation biology to improve the predictability of species outcomes in the future. Hansen et al. (2024) tested the performance of correlative SDMs for the invasive aquatic plant European frog-bit using data at different geographic scales and with and without including field observations. The authors found that interpretations of model outputs can be very different based on the data types included, including which factors are driving species distributions. These comparisons show the direct implications of data integration on the perception of species biology and thus inform or misinform aspects of species biology that are of conservation concern. Similarly, Edwards-Calma et al. (2014) integrated historical land-use data with a recently developed statistical model for estimating a hypothetical fundamental niche for naturalized and native species of ferns. The authors make robust comparisons of species niche occupancy in light of historical land-use changes that reveal the portions of native fern niches that are occupied by naturalized species and discuss the implications for biotic interactions to limit species distributions. These studies demonstrate the power of integrating different data types to improve the conservation value of SDMs and to predict changes in aspects of species biology across space and time. The new methods and approaches presented in this special issue speak to the diversity of approaches that botanists are employing for their work to preserve threatened species and ecosystems in the face of a biodiversity crisis worldwide. Many of these papers were originally presented at the symposium ""From Theory to Practice: New Innovations and Their Application in Conservation Biology,"" held at the Botany 2023 meeting; the symposium had two goals: (1) to highlight new technologies and novel uses of data sets to document and promote the conservation of plant species, and (2) the celebration of the 10th anniversary of Applications in Plant Sciences as a publication of the Botanical Society of America. This special issue—which grew out of the 2023 symposium—highlights some of those advances, among others, to aid in regional and worldwide conservation efforts, including more collaborative data repositories, genetic techniques, machine learning, and refined models. As conservation researchers and practitioners continue to innovate and develop new tools to prevent the further loss of biodiversity, it will be important to continue to share and promote these applications to the wider community. We hope that this special issue will be a useful resource for the community as it continues to innovate and solve problems while facing the challenges ahead.

Initially, the process focused on sub-individual end points; ERA has since expanded to encompass landscape-level analyses. After focusing entirely on single substances, we now recognize the reality of exposure to contaminant mixtures. Assessment techniques have progressed from a simplistic risk quotient method to more sophisticated probabilistic approaches as the library of chemical monitoring and toxicity test data has expanded. The probabilistic approaches, where they can be applied, have reduced uncertainty, yet the link to real outcomes in the field is rarely established. (1)Traditional ERA approaches rely heavily on laboratory-derived exposure and toxicity data for a limited number of individual species, while study of the complex interactions present in natural ecosystems remains rare. These interactions include species–species and species–multiple stressor dynamics (as well as compensating factors), population-level processes such as density dependence and recovery, and ecosystem-level feedback. The outcome for wildlife from the interactions of multiple contaminants in the environment, along with various abiotic and biotic factors, is not taken into account by traditional methods. Consequently, existing methods fail to capture the full spectrum of ecological risks and threats at the ecosystem level, potentially compromising ecosystem security and functional continuity. Conversely, the traditional approaches may overestimate risks due to not taking into account animal behavior or compensating factors.Trait-based approaches offer a promising new direction for stress response and risk assessment at the community scale. (2) Introducing ecological characteristics theory within community ecology into ecological risk assessment, based on toxicity data, may more accurately predict the impact on ecosystems and their functions. By considering impacts on individual organisms to broader community dynamics, these approaches can enhance the mechanistic understanding and diagnostic capabilities of ERA. Future developments may involve combining functional traits of sensitive taxa with real environmental stressors to establish trait-based response indicators for specific contaminants. This could facilitate the construction of community-level safety thresholds for more environmentally relevant ecological risk assessments. While some progress has been made in this area, many significant challenges remain, particularly in developing comprehensive taxonomic trait databases for regions outside Europe and North America and in establishing robust mechanistic relationships between traits and stressors. (3)The implementation of more realistic ERA necessitates the integration of multiple disciplines and cutting-edge technologies. Advancements in analytical chemistry and molecular biology offer novel tools for assessing ecological risk with unprecedented precision. Environmental DNA (eDNA) technology based on high-throughput sequencing demonstrates significant potential for rapid and efficient biodiversity monitoring. (4) Trait-based approaches enhance our understanding of the responses of species to environmental stressors, and when combined with trait databases, they provide valuable insights into sensitive taxa and associated traits. eDNA approaches provide efficient tools for evaluating the effects of chemical pollutants on (1) the occurrences and population of wildlife, (2) communities, and (3) the function of an ecosystem in the field. (4) The application of eDNA technology can improve the relevance and immediacy of laboratory toxicological assessment and provide strong scientific support for ecosystem management and protection.While nontargeted screening techniques can detect a broader spectrum of contaminants, their qualitative or semiquantitative nature limits direct application in quantitative ERA. Combining nontargeted screening with targeted quantitative analysis of numerous chemicals provides a more comprehensive understanding of contaminant mixtures and their potential effects. In addition to applying toxicity data to assess the environmental impact of pollutants, we can establish a nonlinear relationship between the contaminant concentration and organism traits, accounting for the combined effects of other biological or abiotic stressors. The integration of quantitative chemical analysis and eDNA data may accelerate the convergence of predictive risk assessment and biomonitoring, potentially enabling more accurate assessments of contaminant impacts on biodiversity, community structure, and ecosystem function. Nevertheless, establishing quantitative relationships between contaminant concentrations and changes in species biodiversity remains challenging and requires continued research efforts. Advanced mathematical modeling and machine learning techniques offer promising avenues for predicting higher-level ecological responses using readily available underlying data, such as individual-level and molecular-level information. The synergistic utilization of these advanced technologies from analytical chemistry and ecology, coupled with machine learning approaches, could catalyze a paradigm shift in the reliability of comprehensive ecosystem assessment and management. (5)In conclusion, ""trait-based community-level risk assessment"" represents a promising paradigm for future ERA (Figure 1). By incorporating the traits of sensitive taxa and considering multiple biological and abiotic factors, this approach can enhance the mechanistic understanding and diagnostic capabilities of ERA. The integration of trait-based ERA with quantitative chemical analysis and eDNA technology offers new perspectives for ERA at the ecosystem level. While challenges remain in developing comprehensive trait databases and establishing robust mechanistic relationships between traits and stressors, continued research in this direction could lead to community-level ecological risk thresholds that more accurately reflect real environmental conditions. This holistic approach has the potential to provide a more sound basis for aquatic ecosystem protection and environmental management, effectively bridging the gap between laboratory predictions and ecosystem reality.Figure 1Figure 1.

(Wiley-Blackwell) The goal of protecting the aquatic environment through testing thousands of chems. against hundreds of aquatic species with thousands of endpoints while also considering mixts. is impossible given the present resources. Much of the impetus for studies on micropollutants, such as pharmaceuticals, came from the topic of endocrine disruption in wild fish. But despite concern over redns. in fish fertility, there is little evidence that fish populations are in peril. Indeed, fish biologists suggest that many cyprinid populations have been recovering for the past 30 to 40 yr. The central assumption, key to current risk assessment, that effects obsd. in the lab. or predicted by models are readily transferrable to the population level, is therefore questionable. The neglect in monitoring wildlife populations is the key weakness in environmental protection strategies.

(American Chemical Society) A trait-based macroinvertebrate sensitivity model is described which provides two main outcomes: it constructs a macroinvertebrate sensitivity ranking, and subsequently, a predictive trait model for each of a diverse set of pre-defined modes of action (MOA); and it reveals data gaps and restrictions to help direct future research. In addn. to revealing taxonomic patterns of species sensitivity, there was not one genus, family, or class which was most sensitive to all MOA, and common test taxa were often not the most sensitive at all. Traits, e.g., life cycle duration and feeding mode, were identified as important in explaining species sensitivity. For 71% of species, no or incomplete trait data were available, making the lack of trait data the main obstacle in model construction. Thus, research should focus on completing trait databases and enhancing them with finer morphol. traits, focusing on chem. toxico-dynamics, e.g., target site distribution. Further improved sensitivity models can help create ecol. scenarios by predicting untested species sensitivity. This approach can help reduce animal testing and contribute toward a predictive ecotoxicol. framework. >> More from SciFinder ®https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC1MXnvVyhtbc%253D&md5=12c62751b9e285cc8ba9f5221a027ba04Zhang, X.; Xia, P.; Wang, P.; Yang, J.; Baird, D.

(American Chemical Society) A review. Toxic substances in the environment generate adverse effects at all levels of biol. organization from the mol. level to community and ecosystem. Given this complexity, it is not surprising that ecotoxicologists have struggled to address the full consequences of toxic substance release at ecosystem level, due to the limits of observational and exptl. tools to reveal the changes in deep structure at different levels of organization. Omics technologies, consisting of genomics and ecogenomics, have the power to reveal, in unprecedented detail, the cellular processes of an individual or biodiversity of a community in response to environmental change with high sample/observation throughput. This represents a historic opportunity to transform the way we study toxic substances in ecosystems, through direct linkage of ecol. effects with the systems biol. of organisms. Three recent examples of -omics advance in the assessment of toxic substances are explored here: (1) the use of functional genomics in the discovery of novel mol. mechanisms of toxicity of chems. in the environment; (2) the development of lab. pipelines of dose-dependent, reduced transcriptomics to support high-throughput chem. testing at the biol. pathway level; and (3) the use of eDNA metabarcoding approaches for assessing chem. effects on biol. communities in mesocosm expts. and through direct observation in field monitoring. -Omics advances in ecotoxicol. studies not only generate new knowledge regarding mechanisms of toxicity and environmental effect, improving the relevance and immediacy of lab. toxicol. assessment, but can provide a wholly new paradigm for ecotoxicol. by linking ecol. models to mechanism-based, systems biol. approaches. >> More from SciFinder ®https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC1cXjtlOlt7w%253D&md5=21af0a95f22fff2d572b30f4ffde5a6a5Sylvester, F.; Weichert, F.

This approach can help reduce animal testing and contribute toward a predictive ecotoxicol. framework. >> More from SciFinder ®https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC1MXnvVyhtbc%253D&md5=12c62751b9e285cc8ba9f5221a027ba04Zhang, X.; Xia, P.; Wang, P.; Yang, J.; Baird, D.

(American Chemical Society) A review. Toxic substances in the environment generate adverse effects at all levels of biol. organization from the mol. level to community and ecosystem. Given this complexity, it is not surprising that ecotoxicologists have struggled to address the full consequences of toxic substance release at ecosystem level, due to the limits of observational and exptl. tools to reveal the changes in deep structure at different levels of organization. Omics technologies, consisting of genomics and ecogenomics, have the power to reveal, in unprecedented detail, the cellular processes of an individual or biodiversity of a community in response to environmental change with high sample/observation throughput. This represents a historic opportunity to transform the way we study toxic substances in ecosystems, through direct linkage of ecol. effects with the systems biol. of organisms. Three recent examples of -omics advance in the assessment of toxic substances are explored here: (1) the use of functional genomics in the discovery of novel mol. mechanisms of toxicity of chems. in the environment; (2) the development of lab. pipelines of dose-dependent, reduced transcriptomics to support high-throughput chem. testing at the biol. pathway level; and (3) the use of eDNA metabarcoding approaches for assessing chem. effects on biol. communities in mesocosm expts. and through direct observation in field monitoring. -Omics advances in ecotoxicol. studies not only generate new knowledge regarding mechanisms of toxicity and environmental effect, improving the relevance and immediacy of lab. toxicol. assessment, but can provide a wholly new paradigm for ecotoxicol. by linking ecol. models to mechanism-based, systems biol. approaches. >> More from SciFinder ®https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC1cXjtlOlt7w%253D&md5=21af0a95f22fff2d572b30f4ffde5a6a5Sylvester, F.; Weichert, F.

rayyan-210761544,Disease ecology and pathogeography: Changing the focus to better interpret and anticipate complex environment–host–pathogen interactions,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Over the past 15 years, disease ecology has become a discipline in its own right. It is fundamentally based on training in ecology and evolution, with solid theoretical foundations and skills in computational biology and statistics, and it differs from a medical approach to the interpretation of disease. It is concerned with how species interactions, including host–pathogen relationships and environmental conditions (e.g. temperature and rainfall), affect patterns and processes of disease presence and spread, how pathogens impact host individuals, populations, communities, and ultimately ecosystem function (Ostfeld et al. 2008). Initially rooted in parasite ecology, particularly among researchers working on transmission cycles and host–disease population dynamics, disease ecology mainly focuses on parasitic and infectious diseases but is not exclusive to them (Ostfeld 2018). A booming subfield currently concerns research linking different areas such as infectious transmission, agriculture development, and development aid policies, notably in the world's poorest countries (Ngonghala et al. 2014). Unlike ecologists, disease ecologists focus on understanding the causes and consequences of the maintenance and transmission of pathogens in animal species, including humans, plants, and communities of species. It has become much more widespread in studies among wild animal species, also in their contacts with domestic species, e.g. livestock, and their interactions with human populations, and much less so in plant diseases and their transmission, which in some respects are the focus of more plant-pathology molecular-orientated research (Guégan et al. 2023a). We cannot say that the development of disease ecology has involved the gradual integration of several distinct lines of inquiry because it is the heir of ecology. It has an ecosystem-based approach and takes into account natural complexity (Johnson et al. 2015, Hassell et al. 2021, Petrone et al. 2023); it develops experimental methods in the laboratory or mesocosms and has an essential background in statistical and mathematical analysis. The spatial scales of disease ecology study are experimental or local and, depending on the questions posed, can extend to the most global scales (Guernier et al. 2004, Jones et al. 2008, Allen et al. 2017, Carlson et al. 2022). In the temporal domain, these can be daily or weekly studies or multi-decadal investigations, such as in disease population dynamics (Keeling and Rohani 2007). By definition, disease ecology is concerned with understanding patterns and processes on large spatial and temporal scales. It integrates different levels of life organization, i.e. from genes to the global ecosystem, which is not the case, or only to a limited extent, of medical and veterinary approaches (Ezenwa et al. 2015). Over the years, however, disease ecology has gained the confidence of other disciplines, particularly the medical and veterinary ones, and is now published in top-leading generalist journals (Mahon et al. 2024, Pfenning-Butterworth et al. 2024, Chevillon et al. 2024). Today, disease ecology is also challenging established dogmas in human and veterinary medicine, reconsidering several aspects of infectious transmission in-depth, raising the question of possible larger host species spectra, and questioning the origin and nature of pathogen virulence (Chevillon et al. 2024). We are happy to present this special issue on disease ecology in the journal Ecography. At least two other contributions recently published in Ecography could have contributed to this special issue in disease ecology. Both constitute remarkable illustrations of macro-scale studies on host–parasite interactions. They are: Latitudinal distributions of the species richness, phylogenetic diversity and functional diversity of fleas and their small mammalian hosts in four geographic quadrants by Krasnov and colleagues (Krasnov et al. 2023); and Continental-scale climatic gradients of pathogenic microbial taxa in birds and bats by Xu and coauthors (Xu et al. 2023). As illustrated in the different sections of this special issue, disease ecology is a highly interdisciplinary field, drawing on molecular biology and population genetics, immunology, epidemiology, time-series and spatial biostatistics, and ecological and epidemiological modeling. It takes an interdisciplinary approach, often questioning disease distribution, transmission, and intensity from another angle, and this with the wish to propose methods of surveillance, control, and research that are innovative sometimes breakthrough, and more in line with the complexity of the observations made. In summary, the papers we present in this issue illustrate diverse scientific work and confirm the significant growth of disease ecology in the international research landscape. Climate change is accepted as an important driver of infectious disease emergence and spread for humans, wildlife, and domestic animals (Mora et al. 2022). However, there is considerable controversy as to whether climate change operates directly on the ecology of host–pathogen interactions (Franklinos et al. 2019, Casadevall 2020) or whether it intervenes more indirectly by exacerbating prevailing environmental, socioeconomic, or political conditions (Guégan et al. 2023b). In a disease–biogeography study based on field observations, entitled Climate change linked to vampire bat expansion and rabies virus spillover, Van de Vuurst and collaborators (Van de Vuurst et al. 2023) report the impacts of global warming on the distributional range and expansion of the common vampire bat, Desmodus rotundus, across the Americas over the last century. Through a cogent correlation-based statistical analysis, the authors document the gradual expansion of vampire-borne rabies virus outbreaks in cattle herds in the last 50 years of the multi-decadal study period. The results presented here confirm the numerous observations of vampire-borne rabies cases in livestock on the continent while situating it in a macroecological dimension and pathogeography research perspective (Murray et al. 2018). Then, Garcia-Carrasco and coauthors in an article, Present and future situation of West Nile virus in the Afro-Palaearctic pathogeographic system (Garcia-Carrasco et al. 2024), analyze the impacts of climate change on West Nile virus transmission and spread, a disease system that is highly sensitive to weather conditions and change. This virus is transmitted by insect vectors, genus Culex, and is also hosted by a wide range of bird species, making this zoonotic disease highly sensitive to climatic conditions. Using an innovative machine learning and fuzzy logic approach to model the effects of climate change scenarios for 2040 and 2070, this study evaluates the risk of West Nile virus outbreaks in two biogeographic regions, the Afrotropical and the Western Paleartic. They report that the Afro-Paleartic land masses could experience significant upsurges of epizootic and epidemic West Nile virus, with central and northern European regions at notable risk of disease expansion beyond the current distribution range. This study also confirms a broader comparative study on spillover risk in the context of climate change and wild species range shifts (Carlson et al. 2022). Next, Aliaga Samanez and colleagues, in their article Climate change is aggravating dengue and yellow fever transmission risk (Aliaga-Samanez et al. 2024), model dengue and yellow fever diseases, two severe human infectious diseases, considering for the first time urban and sylvatic vectors, and non-primate hosts, to identify areas where climatic favourability for the two viral agents could change with global warming. Both viruses spilled over into human transmission and were translocated in many regions, opening a path for spillback onto sylvatic cycles mainly for yellow fever (Santos de Abreu et al. 2022, Tuells et al. 2022) and DENV-2 serotype (Hanley et al. 2024). Using the same methodological framework as for previous studies, they obtain projections of future transmission risk for dengue and yellow fever and show that global favourability could increase by 10% for dengue and 7% for yellow fever, providing details of regions and subregions at particular risk for each disease. Furthermore, pathogeographical patterns of viral transmission are discussed in light of both vector and non-human primates' geographical distribution and potential range shifts. Projections of disease spread scenarios within the current context of climate change become particularly relevant since these changes disrupt ecological equilibria among vectors, host reservoirs, and human populations. These three examples illustrate the application of disease ecology and biogeography tools to assess the risk of infectious diseases and anticipate their future spread. Human activities modify, either directly or indirectly, the environments in which host–pathogen interactions take place (Lindahl and Grace 2015), leading to more encounters with reservoirs (Rhyan and Spraker 2010) or changes in the natural dynamics of complex multi-species systems (Hassell et al. 2017). In this section, contributors to the Special Issue investigate how habitat alterations and loss can reshape the risk of disease transmission or emergence. Among the drivers that disease emergence and biodiversity loss share, land use features prominently. In their contribution, García-Peña and Rubio (2024) investigate how reservoirs of pathogenic and non-pathogenic New World Hantaviruses (NWH) respond to disturbances alongside a continent-wide gradient going from primary forest to agriculture. Through multivariate analysis, their results suggest that the prevalence of hosts is increased in rangelands and agricultural landscapes, corroborating global comparative studies exploring drivers of spillover transmission from rodent hosts (Ecke et al. 2022). Increased chances of encountering NWH reservoirs in agricultural lands suggest that ongoing widespread reconversion of the forest into cropland, such as the Brazilian Amazon (Morton et al. 2006), may increase the burden of infectious disease. Remarkably, this analysis also highlights a potential hotspot for reservoirs of NWH in northern Canada, a prediction that is well-supported in, for example, the case records of infections of humans by Sin Nombre virus since 1993 (Warner et al. 2020). The question of how much habitat degradation will reshape the global risk of zoonotic diseases is, likewise, the core of the contribution by (Heckley et al. 2023). Through a meta-analysis of neotropical bat prevalence and seroprevalence, they examine the consequences of various classes of habitat degradation (including forest loss) on infection dynamics. Although sampling biases led to an over-representation of data on D. rotundus and rabies virus (see also Van de Vuurst et al. 2023 in this issue), they report that the highest prevalences (above 50%) were only observed in regions with the greatest extents of forest loss in the year before sampling. Identifying these potential causal mechanisms linking habitat degradation to zoonotic disease spillover is critical for more accurate prediction (Plowright et al. 2017, Mahon et al. 2024). The strength of the study by Heckley et al. (2023) is to show how diffuse these effects can be, even within relatively well-described systems (bats in the Neotropics). One possible explanation is that seasonal dynamics (Kessler et al. 2018) can profoundly change the landscape hosts experience, and these intra-annual variations can only be captured with a significantly larger amount of data. In their contribution, Teitelbaum et al. (2024) look at how wild waterfowl interact with domestic poultry farms and how variations in these interactions shape the risk of transmission of avian influenza. The data used in this study (GPS data at the individual scale for over 400 individuals of ten species) offer a high-resolution view of space, time, and taxonomy; this allows for developing an appreciation of the risk of avian influenza transmission at a very fine scale. Different species of wild waterfowl used the habitats provided by domestic poultry farms at different rates, both across day/night and seasonal changes. Coupled with changes in abundance and influenza prevalence, the (multiplicative) interactions between these factors led to substantial changes in transmission risk, even within the relatively homogeneous study environment of California's Central Valley. These studies highlight the challenges of understanding how habitat alteration will reshape the risk associated with disease. Because the ecological processes linking species (and species interactions) to their habitats play out over heterogeneous space and time, the amount of data required to draw general conclusions remains the main obstacle. Advances in Earth Observation through, e.g. remote sensing or the increased availability of high-resolution data with GPS collars are likely to provide good data to generalize our understanding of these questions in the coming years. In this section, the authors illustrate the inherent complexity in host–pathogen or host–symbiont interactions. Indeed, a microbe cannot cause disease on its own without a host (Casadevall and Pirofski 2014). Still, this host–pathogen interaction is also mediated by the relationships it may maintain with other host and non-host species and with abiotic and biotic environmental conditions. Disease is one of several possible outcomes of an interaction between a host and a microbe, and this section also proposes research on host–symbiont relationships. A first contribution by Clark and contributors entitled Aggregation of symbionts on hosts depends on interaction type and host traits analyzes aggregation patterns in both barnacle–limpet and gill helminth–poecilid fish associations (Clark et al. 2023). The aggregation of symbionts and parasites among hosts is a near-universal pattern, and it also has important consequences for the stability of host–parasite associations and disease impacts (Morrill et al. 2022). Identifying which potential drivers are contributing to levels of observed aggregation in these systems has always been a pillar of parasitological ecology, the precursor of what would become disease ecology. This research has also contributed to developing high-performance biostatistical methods, another feature of disease ecology (McVinish and Lester 2020, Lester and Blomberg 2021). Using null models to analyze aggregation patterns in the two systems, Clark et al. (2023) show that aggregation of barnacles on limpets mirrors random partitioning, with variation observed across sites depending on limpet body size. Differently, helminth worms across fish populations were less aggregated than expected by chance, with aggregation decreasing with host fish size. The authors conclude that stochastic processes can account for the aggregation of symbionts on their hosts but do not explain the levels of aggregation observed in host–parasite interactions for which host traits may help to explain aggregation observations. In a second macroecological study, Pinheiro and colleagues describe a latitudinal specialization gradient for a set of bird-malarial parasite networks that do not conform to the rule of accepted higher specialized interactions towards the equator (Pinheiro et al. 2023). Using bird species communities within different biomes on a gradient of temperate to tropical biomes across South America, they show that while specialization of host-parasite pairs interactions, i.e. network connectedness, increases towards lower latitude, quantitative specialization, i.e. including frequencies of host–parasite interactions and host phylogenetic relatedness, on the opposite, decreases. Overall, this study indicates that, near the equator, despite the fact that each malarial lineage parasitizes a more restricted range of available bird species, infections are more evenly distributed among tropical bird species than in temperate regions. In addition to providing strong arguments against a critical ecological hypothesis about species specialization, this work also echoes recent explanations concerning zoonotic viral infections in Southern America (Thoisy et al. 2024). It also contributes to a tradition in disease ecology of conducting comparative studies of non-human systems to better understand human host–pathogen interactions. In essence, ecology is about understanding complex systems and their dynamics, and disease ecology integrates host–pathogen interactions to understand their origin, balance, and imbalance in host–pathogen equilibria and infectious transmission processes, including to humans. Sundaram and collaborators' contribution to this issue examines the origin of Ebola virus in sub-Saharan Africa, adopting an ecosystem-based approach (Sundaram et al. 2024). Instead of exclusively targeting Ebola virus linked to frugivorous bats, suspected to be the active reservoir hosts, this study investigates the role that multiple factors from bats, primates, fruiting tree species, their spatial habitat suitability, and biometeorological parameters play in driving Ebola virus disease outbreaks. Using sophisticated phylogenetically-based path analyses and comparing different plausible path scenarios, it concludes that the factors most associated with previous Ebola virus outbreaks are spatial habitat suitability for Ficus trees and the diversity of Cercopithecus monkeys in the area. Furthermore, frugivorous species guilds, including bats, primates, and several other mammals, plus Pteropodid bat species richness, are good indicators of local Ebola virus circulation but do not explain zoonotic risk. Recent studies (Pleydell et al. 2024) have highlighted the importance of understanding the phenology of various species and the disturbances natural ecosystems and their biodiversity face. This goes beyond simply observing what is readily visible, as the current research demonstrates. In a third investigation, Wallén and colleagues propose a research work entitled Consequences of repeated sarcoptic mange outbreaks in an endangered mammal population (Wallén et al. 2024). Parasites and infections are major factors influencing the population dynamics of wild animals (Hudson et al. 2002, Keesing et al. 2010). The Scandinavian arctic fox, Vulpes lagopus, is and endangered species showing a fragmented spatial distribution and suffering from inter-species competition, prey scarcity, genetic inbreeding and disease pathogens. Wallén et al. (2024) show that sarcoptic mange, caused by Sarcoptes scabiei, is responsible for repeated outbreaks in the artic fox metapopulation, and introduced by a few red fox specimens. Sarcoptic mange effects are severe and affect arctic fox demography and reproductive output. This case study also demonstrates that implementation of non-invasive treatment against V. scabiei can be effective, but only in the short-term, for spatially complex systems with overlapping species (e.g., see Haydon et al. 2006 for another illustration). In the last part of this section, Hjermann and colleagues propose a study entitled Individual and temporal variation in movement patterns of wild alpine reindeer and implications for disease management (Hjermann et al. 2024), in which they analyze animal movement patterns based on GPS-marked wild reindeer individuals to identify chronic wasting disease transmission and potential behaviour risk. Research on wild animal movements and their health situation is scarce (Calenge et al. 2024), and this work attempts to re-establish the situation. Using an extensive individual-based dataset of surveyed Norwegian alpine reindeer with individuals infected by a fatal prion causing chronic wasting diseases, this work shows that the rut season favors an increase in male home ranges, greater home range overlaps and shorter geographic distance between males, and between males and females. These conditions facilitate individual-to-individual transmission of the prion agent, and management measures to prevent excessively high transmission rates affecting livestock survival are suggested. One of the aims of this study is to propose adequate surveillance systems of wildlife to assess disease risk in the most affected regions and reconcile surveillance in the research agenda (Guégan 2024). The final section of this special issue deals with plant–pathogen interactions in space. Tree pests are a global threat to plant biodiversity (Freer-Smith and Webber 2017) and can have cascading effects on a broad range of ecosystem services (Boyd et al. 2013). As plant health is a core factor in maintaining food security (Flood 2010) and human health more broadly (Hulme 2020), these articles highlight how relevant plant–pathogen interactions are to the conversation about disease biogeography. In their contribution Climatic variability, spatial heterogeneity and the presence of multiple hosts drive the population structure of the pathogen Phytophthora ramorum and the epidemiology of Sudden Oak Death, Kozanitas et al. (2024) investigate how Sudden Oak Death epidemiology changes under the joint effects of climate variation, habitat heterogeneity, and host species turnover. Primarily affecting species from the Quercus genus, the pathogen is transmitted through a mostly unaffected host, the California Bay laurel. This causes an interesting challenge for the distribution of the pathogen, as the range of predictors required involves abiotic factors (here, precipitation is particularly determinant) and biotic ones (the distribution of the transmissive host). This situation is not specific to plants and resembles similar systems like the Cryptococcus complex, where the risk of transmission is shaped by climatic variables and the tree composition (Mak et al. 2010, 2015). Caballol et al. (2024) cover much of the same conceptual ground in their manuscript entitled Climate, host ontogeny and pathogen structural specificity determine forest disease distribution at a regional scale, but consider how different pathogen species (Dothistroma pini and Diplodia sapinea) jointly interact with their host (Pinus nigra) and the climate. Although both diseases cause additive effects (on tree defoliation), they report no evidence of competition in adult trees. Environmental heterogeneity manifested itself by changing which pathogen had the largest impact on tree mortality; Dothistroma resulted in more seedling mortality in cold and moist areas, and Diplodia in dry, warm areas. In addition to their different environmental responses, these two pathogens are likely to differ in the micro-habitat they use within the host at the adult and seedling stages. The combination of these factors resulted in a marked variation in the drivers of forest health within the study region: the host–pathogen interaction was regulated by local bioclimatic conditions, even though both pathogens were widely distributed. This is an intriguing observation, as it highlights the need to consider how coinfection may be mediated (and its outcome determined) by environmental conditions. In the final manuscript of this special issue, Contrasting effects of beekeeping and land use on plant–pollinator networks and pathogen prevalence in Mediterranean semiarid ecosystems, Martínez-López et al. (2023) study the interactive effects between beekeeping and land use on the biotic interactions between plants and pollinators, in the context of the emergence of a novel insect pathogen, Vairimorpha ceranae. V. ceranae can be transmitted during pollination (Zbrozek et al. 2023) and may lead to secondary infections by the bacterial genus Serratia (Braglia et al. 2024). In the semiarid ecosystems studied, the authors report that the prevalence of the pathogen is not predictive of its spread but varies considerably within the year. Although communities with more diverse pollination interactions and more plants tended to show a lower prevalence, this effect was only weakly significant. Yet, this is an interesting observation that should lead to future investigations of how the structure of interactions within communities can shape the potential for dilution effects. A striking takeaway from this article is that several causal relationships may only become apparent once temporal delay is considered; this emphasizes the need for temporal data collection that would re-survey several sites/communities to capture these complex temporal interactions. The interdisciplinary field of disease ecology has significantly evolved over the past 15 years, establishing itself as a distinct discipline within ecology and evolution. This special issue of Ecography underscores the importance of understanding the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of diseases, emphasizing the intricate interactions between hosts, pathogens, and their environments. The studies presented herein reflect the diverse and growing body of research that characterizes modern disease ecology, spanning topics such as climate change, habitat alteration, and the complex interplay of ecological and disease processes. The insights from this special issue suggest several areas warranting further exploration. Future research in disease ecology should prioritize integrating advanced climate models with data on ecological interactions to predict disease dynamics under changing environmental conditions. Such studies are likely to benefit from longitudinal studies tracking disease patterns over time, which are essential for identifying trends and informing management practices. Embracing interdisciplinary research that combines molecular biology, genetics, epidemiology, and ecological modeling will enhance our understanding of disease processes. Such an approach will foster innovative solutions for disease surveillance and control and for maintaining environmental health, for instance, by advancing our understanding of biodiversity's role in disease resilience. Interdisciplinary thinking applied to research on the human–wildlife interface (social science, ecology, and epidemiology) will be critical for mitigating spillover transmission risks to humans as human activities increasingly impact natural habitats. Health geography and, a fortiori biogeography and pathogeography of infectious disease, have suffered a significant loss of importance over the last 30 years in human and veterinary medicine. It is very common in the medical world to speak of ecological studies to describe the finding of spurious correlations, which in medicine are not convincing compared with the gold standard of cohort analysis studies. At the heart of this discrepancy lies the subject of changes in spatial and temporal scales, and scale-dependency, which are major concerns for science in general. Several investigations have been developed to estimate biologically relevant spatial and temporal scales at which environmental conditions impact ecological patterns and processes in ecology (Pease 2024), but this is less common in disease ecology (Becker et al. 2019; but see Halliday et al. 2020, Liu et al. 2022). Temporal and/or spatial varying scales of effect are plausible in host–disease interactions, but they remain largely untested in both theoretical and empirical studies. The debate around the dilution effect is illustrative of this. Disease–biodiversity relationships reveal contrary relationships depending on different parameters, like disease transmission categories, land types or spatial scales. Temporal and/or spatial variation in scales of effect can strongly depend on available variables at scales of interest, making that host–pathogen interactions and changes can be best explained by changes in human development at local scale because these parameters are measured and available, and explained by climatic variables and climate change at largest scale, at which these variables can be obtained, i.e. the Elton's sound hypothesis (Chavy et al. 2019 for an illustration on human leishmaniasis in southern America). This also indicates an important issue about collected data since biotic and human behaviour and attitude data exist at lower scales and quasi-absent at largest scales when abiotic parameters, e.g. meteorological data, dominate. We strongly encourage disease ecologists towards this research avenue in order to elucidate host–pathogen and also tri-trophic interactions at specific scales of effect and deciphering their ecological and evolutionary drivers. This will help disease ecology to be better understood, taught in veterinary and medicine schools, and interpreted by disciplines that are either reticent or still too hegemonic, and to play a part in the process of aiding animal and public health efforts worldwide. Disease ecology is poised for continued growth and impact in a world where change is visible at every observable scale. The advances in our field will be driven by the need to understand and take action to address the complex challenges of infectious diseases. This special issue highlights the current state of knowledge across numerous systems and scales, and sets the stage for future research to further unravel the web of interactions that define disease ecology. – This work was supported by the joint NSF-NIH-NIFA Ecology and Evolution of Infectious Disease program (DEB no. 1911457) to JFG and (NIFA no. 1211-1143-00-A, DEB no. 2308273) to BAH.

rayyan-210761547,Apis mellifera welfare: definition and future directions,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Apis mellifera, commonly known as the Western honeybee, plays a crucial role in providing ecosystem services, such as pollination, which are essential for biodiversity and environmental quality (Stout and Finn, 2015). Honey bees are the most economically valuable pollinator worldwide and impact a wide number of commercial crops and wild plants, some of which are threatened by extinction (Hristov et al., 2020). Hive products are valuable not only for their economic benefits but also for their positive impact on human and animal health (Boppré and Vane-Wright, 2019;Brodschneider and Gratzer, 2021;De Goede et al., 2013). Thanks to its pollination services, Apis mellifera is regarded as a flagship species among pollinators and serves as a biomarker for environmental quality (FAO, 2022;Giovanetti and Bortolotti, 2023;Olate-Olave et al., 2021).Beekeepers promote sustainability and product safety by adopting Good Beekeeping Practices and Biosecurity Measures, following the principles of the One Health approach to achieve collective health for animals, humans, and the environment (Brodschneider and Gratzer, 2021;Lerner and Berg, 2017;Pietropaoli et al., 2020;Rivera-Gomis et al., 2020). However, a more advanced approach to apiculture should incorporate animal welfare considerations, as these represent a key component in the shift towards more sustainable farming practices (Escobar, 2022;Koralesky et al., 2022;Lanzoni et al., 2023;Stamp Dawkins, 2021).Animal welfare science, a multidisciplinary field involving ethics, laws, physiology, ethology, and farming, is now a significant consideration in modern policies and scientific research (Koralesky et al., 2022;Vapnek and Chapman, 2010). Poor welfare can exist also in animals that appear healthy and productive, and its negative outcomes become evident only when coping mechanisms fail, leading to issues like illness, lack of productivity, infertility, and behavioural anomalies (Bottaccioli and Rulli, 2014;Fraser, 2008;Moberg, 1985;Sandfoss et al., 2020;Yeates, 2024). Since the beginning of the 21st century, ensuring good levels of animal welfare has shown to improve production outcomes, maintain healthy animals, and reduce intervention costs (Fernandes et al., 2021), while enhancing the living conditions of animals, humans, and the environment in various aspects, including social, health, economic, behavioural, and mental domains (Bayvel, 2004;Beausoleil and Mellor, 2015;Browning, 2022). Several studies have shown that animals living in good welfare conditions not only produce more, but also exhibit better health and fertility. This reduces the costs associated with treating sick or infertile animals, limits the usage of antimicrobial substances and enhances growth and resilience (Blokhuis et al., 2013;Fernandes et al., 2021;Fraser, 2008;Mariottini et al., 2022;Moriconi et al., 2024).In this context, the One Welfare approach, encouraged by the FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations) and WOAH (World Organization of Animal Health), is gaining global traction (Baragli et al., 2022;FAO, 2023;Verniers, 2022). This approach advocates for the interconnected and shared welfare of humans, animals, and the physical and social environments (Keeling et al., 2022;Stephens, 2022;Vapnek and Chapman, 2010). Traditional animal welfare is based on the Five Freedoms, which outline the fundamental requirements for contemporary animal farming to satisfy the essential needs of the farmed animals (Blokhuis et al., 2013;Broom, 2008). These include Freedom from hunger and thirst, Freedom from discomfort, Freedom from pain, injury and disease, Freedom to express normal behaviour, and Freedom from fear and distress (Brambell, 1965).The Five Freedoms, initially conceived to protect intensively farmed mammals and birds, have evolved in response to changing public opinion and values regarding animals (Alonso et al., 2020). In recent years, animal welfare science has expanded its focus from avoiding negative impacts to also include providing positive welfare states. Modern practices now emphasize good farming and product standards (Browning and Veit, 2021), based on the more comprehensive Five Domains Model (Beausoleil and Mellor, 2015;Grandin, 2022;Mellor, 2016;Mellor et al., 2020). This approach aims for a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being, rather than merely the absence of disease or infirmity, considering as significant the welfare of all the stakeholders involved (human, animals and the environment). The model not only addresses the basic needs of the animals, but also emphasizes that animal welfare is a continuum from negative to positive emotional states. It strives to enhance animal welfare by placing greater emphasis on the mental experiences of the animals (Vigors et al., 2021). Despite their remarkable abilities, honey bees have been given limited consideration in terms of welfare due to uncertainty about their capacity to experience mental states. However, based on numerous scientific reports, we believe that honey bees are capable of feelings and emotions, and they align perfectly with the Five Domains model, just like any other animal (Andrews, et al., 2022;Chittka, 2022;Chittka andGeiger, 1995, 1995;Degen et al., 2015;Garrido and Nanetti, 2019;Perry et al., 2017;Solvi et al., 2016;Tan et al., 2013).The New York Declaration recently acknowledged the realistic possibility of consciousness in invertebrates (Andrews, et al., 2022), including Apis mellifera, emphasizing the importance of considering their welfare based on scientific evidence1 . However, animal welfare is applicable once its meaning is clearly defined and practical actions are implemented to measure and to improve specific indicators (Lanzoni et al., 2023;Lorenzi et al., 2023;Sevi, 2009). For Apis mellifera, the concept of welfare needs to be further defined, drawing from models that address contemporary threats and promote preventive approaches (Donkersley et al., 2020).The concept of welfare has been explored through various lenses, primarily focusing on either the subjective experiences and consciousness (Experience Welfare) or on the physical health, biological functioning, and the ability of animals to perform natural behaviours (Functional Welfare) (Birch, 2022;Mellor, 2016). By integrating both experience welfare and functional welfare, a more comprehensive understanding of animal welfare can be achieved, ensuring that animals experience both physical well-being and positive emotional states (Reimert et al., 2023). For Apis mellifera, applying Experience Welfare can be challenging due to difficulties in reaching consensus on honey bee cognition, which might lead to arbitrary conclusions. However, the recent New York Declaration could help guide the discussion and address this issue. In fact, the welfare of insects in captivity encompasses a complex array of issues, like stress, loss of individual choice, suffering, pain and sentience (Boppré and Vane-Wright, 2019). Sentience, understood as the capacity to experience positive and negative feelings (Birch, 2017), has rarely been considered in traditional beekeeping practices. However, recent studies on invertebrates, including bees, suggest that individual bees as much as the superorganism exhibit distinct personality traits, highlighting the need to pay greater attention to their welfare, especially in the context of intensive, managed apiculture (Mather and Carere, 2019). Given the highly social and interconnected nature of bees, both the collective personality of the colony and the individual experiences of each bee should be acknowledged when they are held in captivity (Pinter-Wollman, 2012). For instance, foraging bees have been shown to exhibit varying personality profiles depending on the areas they forage, which could indicate different levels of stress or well-being in these environments (Chittka, 2022). Failing to recognize this could lead to unnecessary suffering: sentience is crucial for adapting beekeeping practices to minimize negative experiences and promote positive ones, particularly in captivity where stressors may be heightened. In 2019, Garrido and Nanetti have been at the forefront of defining welfare in managed bees, describing it as the ""most natural condition possible"" under managed circumstances, while considering all potential threats to honeybees (Garrido and Nanetti, 2019).The responses to stress events characterize the animal's welfare status, which relies on animal's subjective experiences (i.e. sentience). Sentience grants the ability to consciously experience negative or positive sensations, emotions, feelings, or other subjective states that are significant to the animal (Mellor, 2019). Sentience plays a crucial role in understanding the variety of animal welfare status, whether experiences are negative (welfare compromising), or positive (welfare enhancing) (Mellor, 2019). Sentience is recognized in animals regardless of their cognitive capacities, a topic that scientific communities have recently been focusing on, particularly in the case of honeybees (Andrews, 2024;Chittka, 2017;Perry et al., 2017;Wenseleers and Van Zweden, 2017).The New York Declaration on animal consciousness highlights the realistic possibility of conscious experience in many invertebrates, including insects, and stresses the importance of considering this possibility in welfare decisions (Andrews, 2024). Even in the absence of conclusive evidence of sentience, the precautionary principle and the Terrestrial Animal Code (WOAH, 2013), along with the Animal Welfare Act, grant welfare considerations to all animals (Birch, 2017;Knutsson and Munthe, 2017;Lundmark et al., 2013).Thus, animal welfare assessments should be carried out also in the beekeeping sector and the methods used can be supported by established Good Beekeeping Practices and Biosecurity Measures and can benefit from comprehensive data and insights from surveys, studies, beekeeper experiences, and in-hive monitoring (Precision Beekeeping). In order not to overlook the relationship between environmental stressors and animals' stress-responses, the use of both Resources-Based Indicators and Animal-Based Indicators to assess honeybee welfare, appears to be the most suitable solution (Montagnin et al., 2024;Moriconi et al., 2024). For Apis mellifera such approach has been already used in research projects in Europe, like B-WELL (Italian Ministry of Health, 2022) and CLASSYALV (Italian Ministry of Health, 2020) (Montagnin et al., 2024).With the New York Declaration regarding honey bee sentience now addressed, we can incorporate Stamp Dawkins' recent statement on animal preferences to refine our understanding of bee welfare (Stamp Dawkins, 2021). Marian Stamp Dawkins suggested that an animal in good welfare is healthy and ""has what it wants"", indicating a positive state of preference defined as ""valence state"" (Birch, 2022;Stamp Dawkins, 2023, 2021). The latter is a neutral status, functionally positioned between consciousness and non-consciousness, where animals process information, make choices for their best interests, and express preferences based on the environmental options available to them. Many bee species have demonstrated such capacities (Menzel, 2021), exhibiting behaviours indicative of desire, curiosity (Degen et al., 2015) playfulness (Galpayage Dona et al., 2022), anxiety, and despair (Bateson et al., 2011;Schönfelder and Bogner, 2017;Tan et al., 2013;Wehmann et al., 2015). In bees, affective states were reported to influence decision-making, just as they do in humans and other vertebrates. While the neurophysiological mechanisms are probably different, the resulting decisionmaking behaviour appears similar (Mendl et al., 2011). Thus, the study of emotion-like patterns in bees is becoming an increasingly important topic within the scientific community (Baracchi et al., 2017;Chittka, 2017;Chittka and Geiger, 1995;Mendl and Paul, 2016;Perry et al., 2017;Perry and Baciadonna, 2017;Solvi et al., 2016).Stamp Dawkins's definition of animal welfare aligns with the fundamental needs outlined in many scientific and ethical declarations (Stamp Dawkins, 2021). The most prominent of these is the Five Freedoms enunciated in the Brambell Report (Brambell, 1965;Carenzi and Verga, 2009;Webster, 2001) and later by the British Farmed Animal Welfare Council (FAWC) in 1979. However, since its inception, animal welfare science has made significant progress, going beyond the basic needs of animals to also include positive experiences, as highlighted in the Five Domains model. In addition, the widely recognized One Welfare approach emphasizes the interconnected welfare of humans, animals, and the environment (Fraser and MacRae, 2011;Koralesky et al., 2022;Lanzoni et al., 2023;McGreevy et al., 2020;Pinillos, 2018;Stephens, 2022), and organizations like FAO (2009), WOAH (2024), and the European Community (2024) are actively supporting initiatives to advance this approach.Based on these considerations, we propose a novel welfare definition for Apis mellifera that follows a functional approach: ""a balanced and dynamic state, as natural as possible, where the beehive superorganism and each individual bee have the freedom to express their roles and preferences, meet their fundamental needs, and adapt positively to variable external stressors without enduring unnecessary suffering"". This definition captures the essence of honey bee welfare, acknowledging both individual and colony-level needs and emphasizing adaptability and natural living conditions.Honey bees have only recently been considered within the scope of Animal Welfare (Garrido and Nanetti, 2019), and there was still no clear definition that apply welfare principles. Due to limited knowledge about the cognitive world of bees, the scientific community has long been sceptical about the necessity of considering welfare in invertebrates (Perry et al., 2017). Thanks to the New York Declaration, scientific research, and growing public and institutional awareness, solid foundations have been established to approach welfare in honey bees, accounting their consciousness and acknowledging the extraordinary abilities of their minds (Baracchi et al., 2017;Boppré and Vane-Wright, 2019;Chittka, 2022aChittka, , 2017;;Perry and Baciadonna, 2017;Pinter-Wollman, 2012;Solvi et al., 2016), as we did in this work. Acknowledging the complex interplay of colony dynamics and individual experiences our definition is flexible and applicable to various scenarios, including experimental, breeding, and non-traditional beekeeping. This opinion piece offers a focused perspective on what welfare means for honey bees fostering narrow actions to make progress in beekeeping practices, aligning apiculture with the One Welfare framework for the first time.Additionally, this definition introduces the welfare's functional approach for honey bees, opening roads to viable actions for control, assessments and measurements, such as welfare indicators and to improvements, such as identification of honey bee welfare practices.In our opinion, we believe that a functional definition of Honey Bee Welfare is essential for advancing beekeeping practices and honey bee research. Nowadays, beekeeping cannot disregard animal welfare and it must provide a clear and actionable framework to endure good living conditions of Apis mellifera (Garrido and Nanetti, 2019). Applying welfare principles to honey bees involves addressing their ability to cope with stress (Even et al., 2012;Jhawar et al., 2023), maintain balance, and express preferences (Chittka, 2017;Stamp Dawkins, 2023;Rault et al., 2020;Stamp Dawkins, 2021) within a biocentric framework. This approach not only enhances our understanding of honey bees but also opens the door to increasing general knowledge about their needs and well-being. By integrating beekeeping with the principles of the Five Domains model into a comprehensive, multi-level, and interdisciplinary approach, under the One Welfare perspective, apiculture can become more welfare-oriented. Developing a welfare-friendly beekeeping sector begins with a clear understanding of what constitutes the good life for Apis mellifera and redefining its needs through this novel welfare definition. This approach not only advocates for honey bee resilience but also aligns with the broader goal of creating a balanced world. Establishing this new definition of Honey Bee Welfare will clarify their role within a shared future context (Fraser, 2019) and support the development of policies and regulations that reflect the latest scientific and ecological knowledge, as well as contemporary attitudes towards managed animals.Future research directions should focus on refining and validating welfare indicators specific to honey bees, considering both individual bees and the colony as a superorganism. This includes developing new methodologies for assessing bee health, behaviour, and environmental interactions (Papa et al., 2022), and creating welfare assessment tools that can be easily used by beekeepers and sector operators, like entomologists, veterinarians, ecologists, and social scientists. Interdisciplinary collaborations will be crucial in addressing the multifaceted challenges of honey bee welfare. Emphasizing the role of technology in monitoring and improving bee welfare, such as through the use of sensors and artificial intelligence, can also provide real-time data and insights (Danieli et al., 2023). Policymakers should be informed by this research to establish guidelines and standards that promote sustainable and welfareoriented beekeeping practices. Education and outreach programs for beekeepers and the public will be vital in fostering a culture of welfare awareness and encouraging the adoption of best practices. Ultimately, advancing honey bee welfare will contribute to the health and stability of ecosystems, benefiting both biodiversity and human societies.","",https://doi.org/10.3389/fanim.2024.1486587,"",,
rayyan-210761563,"Parasitic plants are models for examining global food security, biodiversity loss and host–parasite evolution, in a changing world",,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Parasitic plants, though often overlooked, are of exceptional importance and play a major functional role in the world's ecosystems. Where parasitic plants affect agricultural systems, they pose a threat to global food security at a time when this is already foreshadowed by a fast-changing climate, a growing human population, economic volatility and abiotic stressors. Parasitic plants include evolutionary enigmas, for example, the world's largest flowers and plants that grow inside other plants; they are also models for exploring plastome evolution and plant–plant interactions. In this special issue of Plants, People, Planet, 16 articles give a holistic, multidimensional snapshot into current parasitic plant biology and present ways forward in the context of major global change. Parasitic plants devastate crop productivity around the world, threatening food and nutritional security for millions. In this special issue of Plants People, Planet, we provide a systematic analysis of some of the most devastating parasitic plants that threaten global food security focusing on (i) witchweeds, (ii) broomrapes and (iii) vampireweeds. Witchweeds—members of the genus Striga—have earned themselves the nickname 'cereal killers' because of their devastating destruction of Africa's most staple cereals, including maize, sorghum, millets and upland rice. Striga is a highly successful parasite, the lifecycle of which is tightly synchronised with that of its host (Runo & Kuria, 2018). Central to this synchronisation is its ability to detect and locate would be hosts through biomolecules—predominantly strigolactones—emitted from the host (Al-Babili & Bouwmeester, 2014; Matusova et al., 2005). Ironically, the reliance of Striga on strigolactones (SLs) is also its Achilles' heel as this presents opportunities for control through manipulation of communication exchange. One approach involves growing Striga alongside a false host that releases SLs, which trigger Striga germination but fail to support its growth or infection (Khan et al., 2011). Another method uses germination stimulants applied to bare fields to induce Striga germination without a host (Jamil et al., 2022, 2024; Kountche et al., 2019). These methods are referred to as 'suicidal germination'. Additionally, breeding host crops that produce insufficient or less potent SLs can also help manage Striga infestations. These strategies have made SLs a central focus of research for Striga control. Mutinda et al. (2023), published in this issue show that some sorghum varieties do not produce effective germination stimulants, making them resistant to the parasite. The study uses molecular markers, which lead to the identification of new sorghum genotypes, which incur less Striga infection due to a mutation in a genetic region described as the low germination stimulant loci 1 (lgs1). This mutation shifts the SL production flux from a potent SL (5-deoxystrigol) to orobanchol, a less potent SL. This genetic change brings to light the vast diversity of SLs and potential application in Striga resistance breeding. But it is not just Striga-host communications that SLs modulate. Striga 'eavesdrops' on the communication exchange between host crops and soil microorganisms. Host crops produce SLs when nutrient levels in the soil drop; especially soil phosphorus (P), to attract mycorrhizas that make P available (López-Ráez et al., 2011). Moreover, SLs act as shoot inhibiting hormones responsible for shaping plant architecture (Umehara et al., 2008). In a timely and comprehensive review, Shimels et al. (2024) provide an analysis of the diversity of SLs in sorghum, focusing on (i) the complexity of SL biosynthesis across different plants, (ii) their roles in promoting symbiosis with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and influencing shoot architecture and (iii) how this knowledge could enhance the use of SLs to manage Striga infestations in Africa. At the core of the SL diversity are the alpha-to-beta interconversions of SL stereochemistry by a sulfotransferase enzyme named SbSOTA (Shimels, 2019). Using molecular docking data, Shimels et al. (2024) explain how this conversion happens: In wild-type LGS1 genotypes, the enzyme SbSOTA adds a sulphate group to 18-hydroxy-carlactone, an intermediate SL biosynthesis pathway. This sulfated intermediate is then carboxylated at carbon 19, followed by ring closure, which results in the loss of the sulphate group and the formation of 5-deoxystrigol with a beta-oriented stereoisomer. In contrast, lgs1 mutants lack functional SbSOTA, so no sulphate group is added on 18-hydroxy-carlactone. Instead, oxidation occurs at carbon 18, followed by another oxidation at carbon 19, leading to ring closure in an alpha conformation and the production of orobanchol. This diversity caused by mutations presents opportunities for managing Striga through induced mutations, such as genome editing (Runo et al., 2024). However, as Shimels et al. (2024) point out, lgs1 is unique to sorghum, meaning this approach (lgs1-based resistance) cannot be applicable across other Striga-infected cereal hosts. On the plus side, symbiotic arbuscular mycorrhiza fungi are not affected by changes in SL stereochemistry—nor is the plant's architecture—indicating that such mutations could be introduced in sorghum for Striga resistance without adversely affecting crop performance. Remaining with SLs, Irafasha et al. (2023) put forward the view that sorghum emits a complex blend of biomolecules in the rhizosphere, some of which may interact with SL either to suppress or enhance Striga germination. To support this argument, Irafasha et al. performed a comparative transcriptomic analysis to identify major transcriptomic changes that define the germination process in Striga and a set of genes that may contribute to the differences in germination rates of resistant and susceptible sorghum genotypes. Irafasha et al. (2023) revealed that germination results from a culmination of a complex of hormonal crosstalk—especially abscisic acid (ABA) biosynthesis pathway, the repression of which was a prerequisite. Other hormones influencing germination were as follows: (i) ABA and auxin repressed germination; (ii) brassinosteroid, ethylene and gibberellin promoted Striga germination. Further evidence supporting Irafasha et al. (2023) lies in the finding of Chen et al. (2024) published in the same issue. Chen et al. (2024) validated the hormonal crosstalk argument, showing that gibberellin promotes Striga germination by shortening the conditioning period required for seed maturation. In this issue, Mwangangi et al. (2023) explored Striga resistance mechanisms beyond germination, focusing on post-attachment resistance. They present strong evidence that combining Striga resistance with plant nutrients enhances the effectiveness of sorghum's resistance and tolerance. The study underscores the importance of an integrated approach for effective Striga management. Broomrapes (Orobanche and Phelipanche spp.) pose a threat to crops across the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere as much as witchweeds do in tropical areas. Broomrapes are especially prevalent in the Mediterranean Basin, western Asia and in southern and eastern Europe. Podalirius aegyptiaca, P. ramosa and O. cernua are particularly pernicious to the cultivation of tomatoes (Goldwasser & Kleifeld, 2004). Tourneur et al. (2024) highlight the impact of O. cumana on sunflower production and introduce an innovative method to mitigate crop losses. O. cumana, also known as sunflower broomrape, is one of the most significant biotic threats to sunflower cultivation in Eurasia and North Africa, with reported yield losses reaching up to 100% (Eizenberg et al., 2004; Molinero-Ruiz et al., 2015; Shi et al., 2015). The authors present a novel technology platform using microRNA-encoded peptides (miPEPs), a new class of peptides that regulate miRNA expression and their target genes as a control strategy for O. cumana. In their proof-of-concept study, miPEPs targeting O. cumana were applied to sunflower plants via watering to inhibit the parasite seed germination. This approach offers promising potential for managing parasitic plants, and with expanding genomic data, it could be adapted for other species, including witchweeds as well as various broomrapes. Vampireweed (Rhamphicarpa fistulosa) is a facultative root parasitic plant that has more recently become problematic in rainfed lowland rice systems (Rodenburg et al., 2011, 2015). In this issue, Rodenburg and Bastiaans (2024) use a comparative approach to examine the ecological and biological differences between vampireweed (R. fistulosa) and witchweed (Striga spp.) to inform targeted management strategies in rice farming systems. Their recommendations for managing Striga spp. include preventive measures like no-till farming, crop diversification, fertilisation, delayed sowing and using resistant or tolerant crop varieties. For R. fistulosa, they also suggest early sowing and using resistant or tolerant varieties. Furthermore, they recommend postemergence chemical interventions for R. fistulosa. Among the most bizarre and extraordinary of all parasitic plants are the endoparasites—those that spend most of their life cycles embedded within the tissues of their hosts in the form of a highly reduced endophyte and emerge only to reproduce. There are four such examples in the plant kingdom, and two are covered in this special issue in detail: Cytinus (Cytinaceae) and Rafflesia (Rafflesiaceae). Due to this extraordinary convergence in life history, the families Apodanthaceae, Cytinaceae, Mitrastemonaceae and Rafflesiaceae all of which comprise 'plants that grow in plants' were long thought to be monophyletic before DNA sequencing analysis revealed their independent origins. Owing to the cryptic life cycles of endoparasites, the taxonomy of some genera is poorly understood. As de Vega et al. (2023) explain in their Flora Obscura article, this is the case for Cytinus, a disjunct genus that is likely to include several undescribed species, particularly in their threatened forested habitats of Madagascar at the east of its range. The authors' work on Cytinus highlights the complex biology of parasitic plants and the importance of taxonomy-informed conservation. Three papers in this special issue of Plants People, Planet focus on Rafflesia, the genus that contains the world's largest flowers. Malabrigo et al. (2023) explain in their paper focusing on extinction in the genus, the plant has long been used in ethnobotanical medicine and, more recently, as a source of revenue from ecotourism. But despite its acclaim, Rafflesia remains poorly understood in many respects—as also discussed by Molina et al. (2023). Taxonomy is disputed, new species are described each year, and the plant has proven recalcitrant to cultivation. Malabrigo et al. propose a multipronged approach to conserving Rafflesia, combining strengthened taxonomy, ex situ propagation, ecotourism and an extension of protected areas. The authors suggest action devolved to local communities, and awareness campaigns linked to social media networks will be crucial outside of protected jurisdictions. Kusuma et al. (2023) complement the work of Malabrigo et al. (2023) and build on the idea that clarifying species status for closely related Rafflesia taxa with overlapping morphologies is important for informing conservation efforts. Using the Rafflesia species diversity of Java as an example, they highlight how biodiversity conservation is an investment in the health and well-being of both ecosystems and human societies. Molina et al. (2023) report the transcriptome of Rafflesia seeds as part of this larger effort to understand and conserve Rafflesia put forward. Rafflesia has never been grown successfully outside of its native range, as both papers discuss. Consequently, seed banking is not yet possible, precluding a critical management strategy for conservation. The authors explain how investigating Rafflesia seed biology is a critical step to improve its cultivation, which will educate the public about unique species and the importance of conserving their habitats. Together these papers address the plight of parasitic plants, the focus of which has traditionally been eradication where they are problematic and offer solutions to their conservation. They emphasize the challenges associated with these bizarre and often poorly understood organisms. Understanding the mechanisms of interaction between parasitic plants, their hosts and the environment offers crucial insights into plant–plant dynamics, with practical implications for food security, environmental management and our broader understanding of plant ecology and evolution in a changing world. This special issue features three papers that explore these interactions, shedding light on the key processes of seed germination and development of the haustorium—a specialised and multifunctional organ that attaches and penetrates a host root and then connects to the host vascular system to withdraw the necessary water and nutrients to feed the parasite. Germination: Two complementary papers provide valuable insights into how parasitic plant seeds interact with other plants and the environment—firstly, Wakabayashi et al. (2023) take us back to when the first SL (strigol) was discovered—ironically from cotton, as a Striga germination stimulant. After 50 years, the authors have now elucidated the full strigol biosynthetic pathway through the discovery of a critical enzyme called strigol synthase. This discovery and other similar ones that advance our understanding of SL-mediated communication exchange between Striga and its hosts have far-reaching implications in practical agriculture. Secondly, Brun, Pöhl and Wicke (2023) addresses the question: 'If parasitic plant seeds are not stimulated to germinate, how long can they live?'. Brun et al. answer this question by moving us forward in time as broomrapes' and witchweeds' seeds age, revealing the physiological and epigenetic changes then providing clues on seed longevity and viability. From these seed ageing experiments, the authors conclude that seeds of these pests lose their sensitivity to germination stimulants (SLs) and that such changes are associated with DNA methylation. This research provides important information toward a better understanding of parasite seed bank dynamics, which must be accounted for in future control strategies. Haustorium development: Two papers offer insights into development of the haustorium. Firstly, Brun, Leman and Wicke (2023) examined the development of haustoria in P. ramosa. During its growth, P. ramosa forms rudimentary roots that attach to the roots of a host, producing new structures called lateral haustoria. Brun, Leman and Wicke (2023) use a comparative transcriptomic approach and reveal divergence of transcriptional landscapes in terminal and lateral haustoria of P. ramosa indicating differences in primordial cell origin. This research provides valuable insights that will help design management strategies of parasitic plants through exploiting host–parasite communication at the haustorium interphase. Secondly, Kithinji et al. (2024) applied high-resolution X-ray computed tomography (HRXCT) to visualise haustorial structures at cellular resolution among five facultative and obligate parasitic plant species from the family Orobanchaceae. They developed an optimised protocol, incorporating specific sample preparation and contrast staining, to enhance the discrimination between parasite and host cells across different plant–host systems. Additionally, Kithinji et al. (2024) provide new insights into haustorial development, revealing increased complexity along the transition to holoparasitism, particularly host-cell displacement and multiple contact points between parasite cells and the host vasculature in Alectra vogelii and P. ramosa. The method described holds promise for mid-throughput studies and may enable Artificial Intelligence-based automated cell recognition in parasitic plant research.

rayyan-210761781,Deep learning applications to automate phenotypic measurements on biodiversity datasets,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"The growing number of digitised biological specimens brings new possibilities for the study of a wide range of evolutionary questions at broad scales. Taking measurements on digital photos often requires annotations (e.g. placing points on focal locations), and many projects label their digitised specimen datasets (commonly more than thousands of images) manually, which could take a huge amount of time. Deep learning is the state-of-the-art for many computer vision tasks. Deep learning models can be trained on a set of manually annotated images, and can make accurate predictions based on what they learned. To what extent deep learning can help to improve the measurement process on digitised collections has yet to be thoroughly explored. Here, I have applied deep learning models to three tasks on two datasets (bird specimens and Littorina shell images), and show that predicted labels are remarkably accurate and that downstream biological analyses using these labels generated biologically meaningful results. First, I used pose estimation models (algorithms originally designed to identify human body parts) to locate keypoints on bird specimens. The results showed high accuracy with 95% of the validation images (N=5,094) correctly predicted, and rapid generation of data (less than three days to predict keypoints on the whole dataset of >120,000 images). Colours measured by points showed that male birds tend to be more colour-diverse than females. Second, I applied deep learning models to segment the overall plumage areas on the bird dataset. More than 95% of the plumage areas were correctly segmented, and it also took less than three days to segment the whole dataset. I found that colour diversities (calculated from segmentations) among closely related birds tend to be similar across more than 7,500 bird species. Finally, I built PhenoLearn, a user friendly tool that provides functions such as manual annotation (to create training images), predicting using deep learning, and reviewing predictions. I illustrate the broader applicability of PhenoLearn in an example of morphological landmarking on Littorina shell images. More than 98% of the predicted landmarks were placed within the acceptable range. The methods and tools introduced here both illustrate the value of deep learning and significantly increases accessibility to deep learning approaches for non-expert biologists allowing the rapid accumulation of phenotypic datasets at large scales. Taken together, these results show that deep learning methods have great potential for speeding up the measuring process on digitised specimens while producing accurate annotations.","",,"",,

After introducing key terms and modelling approaches, we move chronologically through the drug development pipeline to identify and summarise work incorporating: target identification, design of small molecules and biologics, and drug repurposing. Whilst the field is still emerging, key milestones including repurposed drugs entering in vivo studies, suggest graph machine learning will become a modelling framework of choice within biomedical machine learning.","",,"",,
rayyan-210762167,Collections‐based systematics and biogeography in the 21st century: A tribute to Dr. Vicki Funk,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"This special issue honors Dr. Vicki Ann Funk (26 November 1947–22 October 2019), who passed away after a battle with an aggressive cancer (Fig. 1). Dr. Funk was a Botanist at the Smithsonian Institution in 1981–2019. Vicki was an inspirational evolutionary biologist and a champion for collections-based systematics and biogeography (Funk, 2018). She quite literally changed the way we perform our collections-based systematics today, and she was consistently a driving force for positive change in botany and beyond. Vicki was one of the most active, enthusiastic, and passionate professional botanists of our time. She combined these qualities with a quick mind and glowing wit, always with new ideas or opinions that she was eager to share with anyone who would listen and be willing to enter an engaging dialog. During her distinguished career, Vicki achieved pre-eminence in the fields of phylogenetic methods, systematics, biogeography, and biodiversity conservation. She was a very active member and leader in several professional societies in systematics and biogeography. Her vision and leadership as well as her passion for mentoring the next generation have had a strong influence on the direction of botanical research and the career development of many colleagues. A detailed biography of Vicki was published recently by Wagner & Specht (2020), and her contributions to systematics and biogeography can also be found in the works of Wagner et al. (2019) and Gillespie & Whittaker (2020). Vicki pioneered the use of cladistics or phylogenetic theory in plant systematics in the late 1970s and the early 1980s (e.g., Funk & Stuessy, 1978; Funk, 1982, 1985a). She was one of the few botanists at the time who actively collaborated with leading zoologists in advocating new phylogenetic approaches in systematics (e.g., Funk & Brooks, 1981; Platnick & Funk, 1983; Wiley et al., 1991). She innovatively developed guidelines to detect hybridization events, which are common in plants, using phylogenetic patterns and extensive case studies (Funk, 1985b). She continued to extensively study the evolutionary diversification and classification of the Compositae using phylogenetics (e.g., Funk et al., 2005, 2009; Nie et al., 2013), and added next-generation phylogenomics to her tool box for phylogenetic systematics in the last few years (e.g., Mandel et al., 2015, 2017, 2019). Vicki was one of the world's leading experts on the systematics and biogeography of the sunflower family, Compositae, the largest family of flowering plants with more than 27 000 species, accounting for 10% of all angiosperm species. She started her career in Compositae at the Ohio State University with her dissertation research on the systematics of Montanoa Cerv. (Funk, 1982) under the direction of Tod Stuessy. In 1981, she spent a postdoctoral year at the New York Botanical Garden, where she studied Compositae systematics with Art Cronquist. During that time, Vicki spent 1 day a week at the American Museum of Natural History to develop her expertise and intellectual leadership among the cladistics community. In the subsequent 35 years, Vicki and her large network of collaborators across the globe generated numerous important studies on the systematics and evolution of this large, diverse, and ecologically important, and taxonomically difficult family. The spectacular Compositae book (Systematics, Evolution, and Biogeography of the Compositae) (Funk et al., 2009) is an outstanding example of Vicki's research and organizational skills, which represents the most extensive synthesis of the largest family of plants. The work won the prestigious Stebbins Medal from the International Association for Plant Taxonomy (IAPT) in 2010 (Fig. 2). In her office at the Smithsonian, Vicki was surrounded by all her favorite objects of Compositae plants (Fig. 3). Vicki was one of the founding members of the International Biogeography Society (IBS), and she also served as the President for IBS (Gillespie & Whittaker, 2020). Early in her career, she advocated innovative approaches for cladistic biogeographic analyses (Funk & Brooks, 1981; Funk, 1982; Platnick & Funk, 1983). In the early 1990s, Vicki teamed with Warren Wagner to organize a symposium for the Honolulu botany meetings that explored the utility of phylogenetics to understand the biogeographic patterns of the Hawaiian archipelago. The proceedings were published in the highly influential book Hawaiian Biogeography: Evolution on a Hot Spot Archipelago (Wagner & Funk, 1995). In this volume, Funk & Wagner (1995) articulated the famous progression rule for hotspot archipelagos: clades tend to inhabit older islands first and disperse to younger islands in the order that the islands appear. The large collection of papers in Wagner & Funk (1995) set the foundation for phylogenetic biogeographic research and inspired numerous subsequent studies on the Hawaiian archipelago, the Pacific, and island systems in general (Appelhans et al., 2018a, 2018b). On our expedition to Tibet in 2006 (Fig. 4), Vicki often discussed with the many young participants on the island-like systems on the vast Qinghai–Tibetan Plateau in Asia and inspired many phylogenetic biogeographic studies in that region (e.g., Baird et al., 2010; Wen et al., 2013, 2014; Nie et al., 2013, 2016; Zhang et al., 2019). Vicki was an exceptionally strong advocate for collections-based research (Funk et al., 1999; Funk & Richardson, 2002; Funk, 2004, 2006, 2017, 2018; Wen et al., 2015). She served as Director of the Biological Diversity of the Guiana Shield Biodiversity Program (BDG) for over 30 years and supported collection of diverse organisms from plants to birds, mammals, and insects from the region. Her BDG program was fundamental to document, understand, and conserve the biological diversity of the Guiana Shield area of northeastern South America. The program made more than 60,000 new collections and databased all those plus nearly 100,000 previously collected specimens (Kelloff et al., 2019). The collections and this database are extremely valuable for systematic and biogeographic studies and conservation efforts of a biodiversity-rich region. She made over 15,000 number of collections in her career and brought back important Compositae collections worldwide, especially from South America. She legendarily explored remote areas from the Death Valley to the Roof of the World and targeted her taxa like Bidens orofenensis M.L.Grant in Tahiti via a helicopter (see cover image, this issue). In the genomic era, Vicki was instrumental for establishing the Global Genome Initiative for Gardens (GGI-Gardens) in 2015 with the goal of fulfilling the GGI mission: to preserve and understand the genomic diversity of life on Earth—for the plant tree of life (Fig. 5). Vicki Funk was passionate about mentoring the next-generation biologists, and she mentored more than 40 undergraduate and graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, and inspired numerous interns, students, and visiting scientists through the Botany Department at the National Museum of Natural History at the Smithsonian. Vicki served numerous professional societies in leadership and various other roles. She was the President of the Society of Systematic Biologists in 1998–1999, American Society of Plant Taxonomists 2006–2007, the International Biogeography Society in 2007–2009, the Botanical Society of Washington in 2014, and the International Association of Plant Taxonomists from 2011 to 2017. Vicki received many honors and awards recognizing her achievements in systematics, evolutionary biology, and biogeography. For example, in addition to the Stebbins Medal from IAPT, she was awarded the Rolf Dahlgren Prize in 2014 for her contributions to the systematics and evolution of the flowering plants. In 2018, she won the prestigious Asa Gray Award, the highest honor bestowed to an individual from the American Society of Plant Taxonomists (ASPT). ASPT also established the named Vicki Funk Graduate Student Research Award in her honor at the 2019 Botany Meetings in Tucson, Arizona. Also, in 2019, the Linnean Society of London recognized Vicki with its Linnean Medal for lifetime service to the natural sciences. For this special issue, we invited a broad group of scientists to explore the advances of collections-based systematics and biogeography in the 21st century, to pay tribute to a true leader in our field. We emphasize four major areas that Vicki was passionate about and made significant contributions: Pacific biogeography, statistical phylogenetic biogeography, systematics and evolution of the Compositae (Asteraceae), and collections-based phylogenetic systematics. Three papers in this special issue emphasize plant evolution on oceanic islands. Stuessy (2020) has reviewed the evolutionary processes in plants of oceanic islands (ontogeny of the islands, population divergence, speciation, and hybridization) and argues that the present patterns of distribution and ecology of species within endemic groups may have little to do with the patterns when the species originated. Thus, understanding these environmental changes is fundamental to infer processes such as founder effect and modes of speciation, with case studies from the Juan Fernández Archipelago and Lord Howe Island. Knope et al. (2020) have explored the radiation of the genus Bidens in the Pacific. Although Bidens is confirmed to be polyphyletic within Coreopsis, the Polynesian Bidens is inferred to be monophyletic, and this morphologically diverse clade has most likely radiated from an ancestor in South America. The initial colonization of the Pacific was either to the Marquesas (43% probability) or the Hawaiian Islands (39% probability). The crown group in the Pacific is estimated to have occurred ~1.63 million years ago (Ma), the youngest and most rapid plant diversification events documented in the Pacific. Within the Pacific, each of the Marquesan and Hawaiian radiations was the result of single colonization events, with the Hawaiian radiation being monophyletic and the Marquesan radiation being paraphyletic with respect to the Society Islands radiation. From the Marquesas, Bidens dispersed to the Society Islands and then to the Austral Islands. The study showcases that relatively rare long-distance dispersal and founder event speciation, coupled with subsequent loss of dispersal potential and within-island speciation, can lead to the repeated, complex, and explosive adaptive radiation of Bidens across the archipelagoes of Polynesia. On the basis of the RADseq data, Appelhans et al. (2020) have reconstructed the Hawaiian radiation of Myrsine L. of the primrose family (Primulaceae), the only one of the ten most species-rich Hawaiian plant lineages that has never been studied in a phylogenetic analysis. Myrsine is likely paraphyletic with the monotypic Macaronesian genera Heberdenia and Pleiomeris nested within it, and the Hawaiian Myrsine is supported to be monophyletic. Hawaiian Myrsine includes three main lineages: one of which contains the majority of species mainly from Kauaʻi and the other two lineages are the few widespread species. Quartet Sampling and HyDe analyses further suggest phylogenetic incongruence throughout the phylogeny and provide evidence of extensive hybridization in the lineage (also see Kleinkopf et al., 2019). Four papers showcase the power of phylogenetics in inferring classical biogeographic patterns. Echeverría-Londoño et al. (2020) have explored the diversification patterns of another major plant radiation in the megadiverse genus Solanum L. (c. 1200 species, Solanaceae). Despite the vast diversity of Solanum lineages in the Neotropics, the Old World lineages are inferred to have diversified more rapidly, with the recent increase in diversification coinciding with a long-distance dispersal event from the Neotropics to regions with active major climatic changes. Two groups of Solanum migrated to Australia independently, with the arid-adapted lineages experiencing significant increases in the diversification rate, as they adapted to the long-term climatic trend toward seasonally dry and arid biomes there. This study represents an excellent case study showing how successful colonization of new areas and niches can drive explosive plant diversifications. Zhu et al. (2020) have conducted a phylogenetic biogeographic analysis on the genus Celastrus L. (c. 30 species, Celastraceae) with a wide disjunct distribution in five continents of both hemispheres. The diversification of Celastrus is suggested to be linked to global warming events during the Miocene. The genus is inferred to have originated in tropical Asia and then dispersed to Central and South America, North America, Oceania, and Madagascar at different time periods via long-distance dispersals. Birds may have facilitated transoceanic migrations of Celastrus, due to its bicolored fruits, which contain red and fleshy arils, highlighting the importance of key morphological innovations and animal-mediated dispersals for the rapid diversification of plant lineages across vast distributional ranges. Zhang et al. (2020) have constructed the origin and diversification of Saxifraga L. sect. Irregulares Haw. (c. 15–20 species, Saxifragaceae), one of the early-diverged lineages in the genus. The results corroborate the monophyly of sect. Irregulares and its sister relationship to sect. Heterisia from North America. Divergence time estimates and ancestral area analysis suggest a western North American origin of sect. Irregulares with migration into eastern Asia via the Bering land bridge (Graham, 2018) in the middle Oligocene. The development of desert belt in the late Miocene is hypothesized to be important in the subsequent divergence of the north and south lineages within eastern Asia, supporting an emerging important biogeographic pattern in Asia. Wang et al. (2020) have tackled another classical biogeographic pattern in eastern Asia—the Sino-Japanese disjunctions in Diabelia Landrein (four species, Caprifoliaceae; Linnaeoideae). The species diversification within Diabelia dated back to the middle Oligocene, and phylogenomic analysis of the plastomes supported two independent vicariance events leading to the disjunction between Japan and Korea in the middle-to-late Miocene and between eastern China (Zhejiang) and Japan in the early Miocene. Five papers are included in memory of Vicki's important contributions to Compositae systematics and evolution. Watson et al. (2020) have analyzed five closely related tribes of Compositae (Anthemideae, Astereae, Calenduleae, Gnaphalieae, and Senecioneae), which represent over 10 000 species. These tribes form one of the two megadiverse clades within subfamily Asteroideae. Sampling both the nuclear and plastid genomes via the HybSeq approach (Zimmer & Wen, 2015), Watson et al. (2020) have found both concordance and conflicting support in both data sets and documented four ancient hybridization events. With the timing of the early radiation of this five-tribe lineage dated to be shortly before the Eocene–Oligocene extinction event (c. 34 Ma), early lineages were likely lost, hence obscuring the details of their early diversification history. Ackerfield et al. (2020) have tackled the phylogeny of the thistle genus (Cirsium L.), one of the most taxonomically challenging groups of Compositae in North America. This first phylogenetic attempt of the North American thistles suggests that the messy difficulties within Cirsium may be due to (i) previously undescribed taxa, (ii) inadequate representation of taxa from herbarium specimens, (iii) phenotypic convergence, (iv) hybridization, and (v) incipient speciation. Using a phylogenomic approach, Lichter-Marck et al. (2020) have analyzed the rock daisy tribe Perityleae, consisting of seven genera, most of the c. 84 taxa narrowly endemic on rock cliffs throughout the southwest United States and northern Mexico. Discordance between sources of molecular data supports hybridization events in Perityleae. Phylogenies reject the monophyly of the most species-rich genus Perityle Benth. and several of its sections. Pappus elements show a high level of homoplasy, and flower color is found to be conserved. A base chromosome number of x = 18 is suggested to give rise to lower base numbers in subtribe Peritylinae (x = 12, 13, 16, 17, and 19) via descending dysploidization. Most taxa constitute a clade with a base chromosome number of x = 17, but with many polyploidization events inferred. Using a new progenitor-specific amplicon sequencing method, Wan et al. (2020) have tested the hypothesis that allopolyploidization between the same two parental species has led to the origin of two different yarrow species, Achillea alpina L. and A. wilsoniana Heimerl ex Hand.-Mazz., from the same diploid progenitor species pair, A. acuminata (Ledeb.) Sch. Bip. and A. asiatica Serg. On the basis of the sequences of 17 nuclear genes from 21 wild populations of the four Achillea species investigated, this study supports independent allopolyploidy events between the same Achillea parental species that gave rise to two genetically and ecologically distinct taxa. Approximate Bayesian computation suggested that both tetraploid species originated before the Last Glacial Maximum and nearly all diploid lineages went through population declines after the allopolyploidization events. Ma et al. (2020) have explored the origins of cultivated chrysanthemums using chloroplast genomes and the nuclear LEAFY gene. Several wild species of Chrysanthemum L., for example, C. indicum L., C. zawadskii Herbich, C. dichrum (C.Shih) H.Ohashi & Yonek., C. nankingense Hand.-Mazz., C. argyrophyllum Ling, and C. vestitum (Hemsl.) Stapl, were likely directly or indirectly involved as paternal species of most of the chrysanthemum cultivars examined in this study. Yet, the maternal species is supported to be a lineage of an extinct wild Chrysanthemum species and its subsequent cultivars, as all accessions of chrysanthemum cultivars sampled formed a strongly supported clade, distinct from all other species of Chrysanthemum in the plastome tree. Thus, the results support that the spectacular chrysanthemum cultivars originated from multiple hybridizations involving several paternal species rather than only two or a few wild species, with an extinct species and its subsequent cultivars serving as the maternal parents. Phylogenetic systematics has progressed tremendously in the last decade with the additional sampling of characters as well as taxa. DiMichele & Bateman (2020) have updated the reconstruction of the Carboniferous tree-clubmoss Paralycopodites Morey & Morey from disarticulated, anatomically preserved fossils to determine its phylogenetic position and to infer the developmental biology that dictated its remarkable architecture. Their biological and taxonomic conclusions on the phylogenetically basalmost member of the Carboniferous stigmarian lycopsids can be expanded to encompass the more widespread compression mode of plant preservation. Considering that the recently published Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group classification (PPG I, 2016) did not include intergeneric hybrids (nothogenera), Liu et al. (2020) have provided an evaluation of previously proposed nothogenera in the context of a current phylogeny-based pteridophyte classification. They also explore the distribution of nothospecies across the pteridophyte phylogeny. Their results support future efforts to better report and study hybrids in ferns and lycophytes, especially in biodiversity-rich areas. Spooner et al. (2020) have compared next-generation sequencing results of the same accessions of the carrot genus Daucus L. with different genomic regions: (i) the entire plastid genome, (ii) 47 mitochondrial genes, (iii) 94 conserved nuclear orthologs, and (iv) 564 895 nuclear SNPs. Extensive data discordance is detected in all four results using the same accessions analyzed with maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood, and with the nuclear data species trees through a coalescent analysis. The nuclear results show significant areas of discordance as well. The results, thus, raise questions concerning the best data and analytical methods to reconstruct and understand the ""true"" phylogeny. Thode et al. (2020) have evaluated character partitioning and molecular models in plastid phylogenomics using Amphilophium Kunth (Bignoniaceae) as a case study. They detected incongruences in recovered phylogenetic relationships mainly located in short internodes. They suggest that the selection of appropriate partition strategies and evolutionary models is important to increase accuracy in phylogenetic relationships, even when using plastome data sets. Welker et al. (2020) have proposed a new phylogenetic classification of the grass tribe Andropogoneae Dumort. (14 subtribes, 92 genera, and c. 1224 species), which includes several important crops such as maize, sugarcane, and sorghum, and dominates the tropical grasslands of the world. Their dated phylogeny suggests that Andropogoneae diverged from Arundinelleae in the early Miocene, and the ""core Andropogoneae"" clade is dated to the late Miocene. The tribe was inferred to have originated in eastern Asia, with many independent dispersal events to Africa and the New World. Soreng et al. (2020) have presented a nuclear ribosomal DNA phylogeny of the grass genus Poa L., characterized the breeding systems and morphology for several species of Poa sect. Nivicolae (Roshev.) Prob., and assessed the taxonomy of these poorly understood taxa in the section. Rabarijaona et al. (2020) have revisited the phylogeny and divergences of Cayratia Juss. of Vitaceae and its close relatives in tribe Cayratieae J.Wen & L.M.Lu (Wen et al., 2018), and for the first time broadly sampled the taxa from Africa and Madagascar. On the basis of the new phylogenetic evidence, the authors have proposed a new genus, Afrocayratia J.Wen, L.M.Lu, Rabarijaona & Z.D.Chen from Africa and Madagascar and have provided a taxonomic revision for the genus. The untimely passing of Dr. Vicki Funk was a big loss to the entire systematics, biogeography, and biodiversity science community. Vicki was a dear friend to both of us, and organizing this special issue was a very emotional process for us. We hope that the collection of papers in the special issue will help inspire many colleagues in carrying on the Vicki Funk spirit to promote collections-based systematics, biogeography, and biodiversity science in the 21st Century (Funk, 2018).","",https://doi.org/10.1111/jse.12707,"",,
rayyan-210762216,"Aspen detection in boreal forests: Capturing a key component of biodiversity using airborne hyperspectral, lidar, and UAV data",,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Importance of biodiversity is increasingly highlighted as an essential part of sustainable forest management. As direct monitoring of biodiversity is not possible, proxy variables have been used to indicate site&amp;amp;#8217;s species richness and quality. In boreal forests, European aspen (Populus tremula L.) is one of the most significant proxies for biodiversity. Aspen is a keystone species, hosting a range of endangered species, hence having a high importance in maintaining forest biodiversity. Still, reliable and fine-scale spatial data on aspen occurrence remains scarce and incomprehensive. Although remote sensing-based species classification has been used for decades for the needs of forestry, commercially less significant species (e.g., aspen) have typically been excluded from the studies. This creates a need for developing general methods for tree species classification covering also ecologically significant species.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#160;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Our study area, located in Evo, Southern Finland, covers approximately 83km&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;, and contains both managed and protected southern boreal forests. The main tree species in the area are Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.), Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst), and birch (Betula pendula and pubescens L.), with relatively sparse and scattered occurrence of aspen. Along with a thorough field data, airborne hyperspectral and LiDAR data have been acquired from the study area. We also collected ultra high resolution unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) data with RGB and multispectral sensors.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#160;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Our aim is to gather fundamental data on hyperspectral and multispectral species classification, that can be utilized to produce detailed aspen data at large scale. For this, we first analyze species detection at tree-level. We test and compare different machine learning methods (Support Vector Machines, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Machine) and deep learning methods (3D convolutional neural networks), with specific emphasis on accurate and feasible aspen detection. The results will show, how accurately aspen can be detected from the forest canopy, and which bandwidths have the largest importance for aspen. This information can be utilized for aspen detection from satellite images at large scale.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu2020-21268,"",,
rayyan-210762459,A Metanalysis of Sequences of Vascular Plants in the World’s Biodiversity Hotspots with a Special Section on Madagascar,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Humans have become a major factor in reshaping the Earth’s biosphere. One of the major effects of human changes to the environment is an increase in the rate of species extinction as compared to background rates. Biodiversity hotspots are areas whose species assemblages are very rich (50% of the world’s plants and 42% of land vertebrates) yet very threatened with extinction ( &gt; 70% habitat destruction), and which ought to be foci for conservation efforts. The intense peril in which the flora of these endangered regions are requires an equally intense response from the scientific community. This study investigated the benefits of adding genomic information to voucher specimens to alleviate the Linnaean (lack of species description), Wallacean (lack of data on species distribution) and Darwinian (lack of data on species evolution) shortfalls. An open-source R bioinformatic pipeline was developed to determine the percentage of vascular plant species present in biodiversity hotspots with at least one reproducible DNA sequence deposited on GenBank. Reproducible DNA sequences were defined as being underpinned by traceable material and methods and accurate taxonomic identifications. A vascular plant species checklist for the 36 biodiversity hotspots was inferred using 32,914,892 GBIF occurrences, comprising 204,044 species. A total of 736,532 GenBank accessions (representing DNA barcodes) were downloaded for those species. Associated abstracts and metadata were mined from 3,127 publications deposited on PubMed to assess DNA sequences reproducibility. The reproducibility of each study was tested by a sentiments (natural language processing) analysis. Overall, the analyses indicated that the reproducibility crisis also extended to the realm of biodiversity. There was a significant shortfall in genetic information available for biodiversity hotspots, where 80.3% of the sequences produced (591,431) were not reproducible. This meant that only 19.7% of sequences—representing only 37,637 species (18% of the total)— were reproducible. This phenomenon was named the Wu-Meyersian shortfall to recognize that we are critically lacking DNA sequence data for threatened biodiversity. This shortfall was named in honor of Ray Wu (the father of DNA sequencing; 1928-2008) and Norman Meyers (a pioneer in establishing biodiversity hotspots; 1934-2019). Working on this shortfall could contribute to alleviating the Linnean, Wallacean and Darwinian shortfalls and support conservation. Information was particularly lacking in tropical biodiversity hotspots, but no biodiversity hotspot other than Japan had &gt; 50% of its flora reproducibly sequenced. Older biodiversity hotspots were less known than those established more recently. This is concerning since those are among the most diverse and threatened (e.g. Madagascar, Sundaland). From a DNA region perspective, ITS (23,422 species), <italic>matK</italic> (17,164 species), and <italic>rbcL</italic> (16,509 species) were the most commonly used barcodes. From a lineage perspective, gymnosperms (N=895) are exceptionally well-sequenced, with three quarters of their species having been reproducibly sequenced. Angiosperms are comparatively poorly sequenced (18%), but this may be explained by their extreme diversity (N=195,433). Finally, ferns and their allies (N=7,716) are poorly sequenced (22%). This is especially troubling because extinction of these species would represent the loss of hundreds of millions of years of unique evolutionary history. This study finally proposed best practices to ensure maximizing reproducibility of DNA sequences produced by the scientific community. The bioinformatic pipeline can be applied to systems at multiple geographical scales and any taxonomic groups and is therefore appealing to a wide range of stakeholders. We recommended using it periodically to monitor progress towards alleviating the Wu-Meyersian shortfall.","",https://doi.org/10.18122/td/1707/boisestate,"",,
rayyan-210762475,A finer record of biodiversity,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Paleontology
We have pressing, human-generated reasons to explore the influence of environmental change on biodiversity. Looking into the past can not only inform our understanding of this relationship but also help us to understand current change. Paleontological records depend on fossil availability and predictive modeling, however, and thus tend to give us a picture with large temporal jumps, millions of years wide. Such a scale makes it difficult to truly understand the action of environmental forces on ecological processes. Enabled by a supercomputer, Fan et al. used machine learning to analyze a large marine Paleozoic dataset, creating a record with time intervals of only ∼26,000 years (see the Perspective by Wagner). This fine-scale resolution revealed new events and important details of previously described patterns.

rayyan-210762483,Accurate and robust animal species classification in the wild,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"[ACCESS RESTRICTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI--COLUMBIA AT REQUEST OF AUTHOR.] Wildlife monitoring with camera-traps allows us to collect data at large scales in space and time to study the impact of climate changes, land-use, and human actions on wildlife population dynamics, and biodiversity. With the increase of camera trap used per study and the large number of images generated by camera traps, processing and managing the generated images has become a big challenge. Unlike many other image processing and vision analysis tasks, detecting, segmenting, and classifying animal species from the camera-trap images is very challenging since natural scenes in the wild are often highly cluttered due to heavy vegetation and dynamic background. In this dissertation, we focus on animal object detection and species classification in camera-trap images collected in highly cluttered natural scenes. Using a deep neural network (DNN) model trained for animal- background image classification, we analyze the input camera-trap images to generate its multi-level visual representation. We detect semantic regions of interest for animals from this representation using k-mean clustering and graph cut in the DNN feature domain. These animal regions are then classified into animal species using multi-class deep neural network model. According the experimental results, our method achieves 99.75 percent accuracy for classifying animals and background and 90.89 percent accuracy for classifying 26 animal species on the Snapshot Serengeti dataset, outperforming existing image classification methods. We develop a robust learning method for animal classification from camera-trap images collected in highly cluttered natural scenes and annotated with noisy labels. We proposed two different network structures with and without clean samples to handle noisy labels. We use k-means clustering to divide the training samples into groups with different characteristics, which are then used to train different networks. These networks with enhanced diversity are then used to jointly predict or correct sample labels using max voting. We evaluate the performance of the proposed method on two public available camera-trap image datasets: Snapshot Serengeti and Panama-Netherlands datasets. Our experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods from the literature and achieved improved accuracy on animal species classification from camera-trap images with high levels of label noise. We also develop a new approach for learning a deep neural network for image classification with noise labels using ensemble diversified learning. We first partition the training set into multiple subsets with diversified image characteristics. For each subset, we train a deep neural network image classifier. These networks are then used to encode the input image into different feature vectors, providing diversified observations of the input image. The encoded features are then fused together and further analyzed by a decision network to produce the final classification output. We also study image classification on noise labels with and without the access to clean samples. Our extensive experimental results on the CIFAR-10 and MNIST datasets demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms existing methods by a large margin.","",https://doi.org/10.32469/10355/84261,"",,
rayyan-210762717,Deforestation Prediction using Ensemble of Convolutional Neural Network Models,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"Deforestation is the destruction of forest due to for a non-forest purpose [1]. The disadvantages due to deforestation are an increased amount of carbon dioxide emissions and soil erosion. Increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere increases temperature of the earth, leading to climate change. Also the destruction of forest habitat and the loss of biological diversity of both plants and animals occurs. With increased deforestation earth will lose its top fertile soil layer and get converted into desert. The ecological balance will get disturbed and floods and drought will become more frequent. Wildlife will also be affected. As of now there only one habitable planet, and we need to conserve all life and environment. The surface area of earth is around 510.1 million km2. In this about 29.2% is earths land area. And in that land area only around 30% is the Forest area [2]. There are several studies taken to monitor the deforestation happening in all over the world as well as India. One of the notable ones is which gives the data of loss of 28% forest covers over eight decades. The major deforestation has occurred due to conversion of forests to agricultural lands, timber product, construction of major projects such as reservoirs in dams, road construction etc. Several global, legally binding instruments (LBIs) have instituted requirements for national-level inventory and reporting (UNFF 2004c:7). The recently effective Kyoto Protocol requires the inventorying of land use-related deforestation, afforestation, and reforestation in developed country Parties. For afforestation to occur, it requires more active coordination to support, the environmental objectives of global conventions, such as the conservations on biodiversity and wetland protection [3].
There are many management challenges associated with global forest health. Conversion of forest land to commercial usage, constructions, etc. will not only decrease the forest health but also leads to extinction of many biodiversity’s. In terms of accounting systems for forest yields, global accounts of forest production are based on national reports and contain substantial gaps, particularly in respect to non-timber resources. So, there is no accurate measurement or number to count the number of trees lost. First step in addressing forest deforestation is to monitor and report changes in forest cover in areas that are reserved for forest in the country [4]. Manual labour checking of the land area is time consuming and never ending. In order to overcome this challenge high resolution satellite imaging are utilized. Once again, the manual labour is recurring and tiresome [5].  Use of machine learning methods has emerged in recent days to predict accurately how much of the land has undergone deforestation over the years. utilizing mathematical models and training the systems will result in automatic detection and less human labour for detecting the large amount of satellite data [6]. 
Tarazona, Yonatan, et al focuses on mapping tropical deforestation using time series and machine learning algorithms and were able to classify forest, cropland, bare soil, and water with more than 90% accuracy [7].  Large areas under deforestation and degradation threat, and location of suitable areas for regeneration were predicted by Grinand, Clovis, et al. through machine learning algorithms combined with high-resolution data sets to provide simultaneous and spatial forecasts of deforestation, land degradation, and regeneration for the next two decades [8]. Bavaghar et al. utilised logistic regression on satellite imagery data to estimate the location and extent of deforestation which achieved 75% accuracy [9]. Hyandye et al. used multinomial logistic regression to determine how land use/land cover class in Tanzania was influenced by a set of variables. The authors used the multinomial model, run on Landsat of data across multiple years, to obtain the probable change in land use/land cover.[10]. Szuste et al. [11] used Support Vector Machines for land use and land cover classification in tropical coastal zones achieved decent results.
Kavzoglu and Mather [12] used artificial neural networks to identify land use/land cover for remote sensing data in England, and provide a set of guidelines for practitioners for designing and using artificial neural networks in remote sensing image classification. Some examples of classification using neural networks for remote sensing data are provided by Srivastava et al. [14], Shao and Lunetta [13], and Wang et al. [15]. Kong et al.  [16] apply a long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network to predict forest fire based on a time series of Modis satellite images. They have used a composite time series instead of a single-pixel time series and examined changes to detect fire events. Convolutional neural networks have been successfully applied on multimedia approaches and used to create a system able to handle the classification without any human’s interactions. In [17], for satellite image classification that are based on deep learning convolutional neural network for features extraction used AlexNet, VGG19, GoogLeNet and Resnet50 pretraining models.  Akshay, S., et al, proposed a system for satellite image processing that detects unused land. Here remote sensing earth images are taken as the dataset where the pre-processing step includes converting image into greyscale image, compression and noise removal. Segmentation is done to partition the region of used and unused lands. Random forest is used to segregate two landscapes as used and unused land which gives accuracy better than the existing systems [18]. In the work for recognition in high-resolution, multi-spectral satellite imagery, Pritt, Mark, and Gary Chern [19] have described a deep learning system for classifying objects and facilities from the IARPA Functional Map of the World (fMoW) dataset into 63 different classes. The system consists of an ensemble of convolutional neural networks and additional neural networks that integrate satellite metadata with image features.
The proposed work addresses the detection of the forest cover areas as an important and holistic studies related to ongoing forest cover changes. The outline of the proposed work is shown in Fig.1 It consists of following steps. Preparing Input images acquired from the datasets. In this step the image is acquired, Pre-processed and augmented. Defined two classes for prediction, i.e. 0 is for “No Deforestation happened” and 1 is for “Deforestation”. Labelled the images accordingly and passed it to the pre-trained models for training the models. Pre-trained weights help to overcome the overfitting of the model with a smaller number of datasets. Feature extraction and classification using AlexNet, ResNet18 and DenseNet121 was done individually and all the results were ensembled. We have used Sentinel-2 datasets that is publicly available in Kaggle. 500 original images were used and four different data augmentation techniques were applied to generate more images. A total of 2500 images were utilized to train the models. Data was split into 80% training datasets and 20% validation datasets. 200 separate test sets were taken to verify the test accuracies.
In this proposed approach, all models used Adam optimizer with decreasing learning rate after every 10 epochs. All the graphs were plotted in TensorBoard. The training accuracies are shown in Fig2(a) and losses are shown in Fig 2(b).
After analysing the obtaining of the predictions of all three models, we combined the results of 3 models: AlexNet, ResNet18 and DenseNet121, and predicted the class which was most frequently predicted by all the models. This combined by the proposed Grid searched weighted average ensemble model gave the remarkable best performance and achieved a test accuracy of 90.12% and sensitivity of 95.06%.

Yet, they are one of the most threatened ecosystems in the world. Sundarbans, the world's largest mangrove forest, is a world heritage as well as Ramsar site known for its rich biodiversity. Over time, remote sensing (RS) has become a vital tool for monitoring of natural resources including mangroves for effective management and conservation. Several studies have been carried out on mapping/monitoring of mangroves using remotely sensed imagery and parametric classifiers. During recent decades, non-parametric classifiers, viz., random forest, support vector machine, k-nearest neighbour, decision tree, neural network, etc., have been found to be highly useful. Biological richness or the plant diversity status which is a function of ecosystem uniqueness, species richness, biodiversity value, and disturbance index was determined by integrating RS and field data. Around 75% mangroves of Indian Sundarbans were found to be highly rich in diversity, with the highest richness being observed in mixed mangroves. The availability of higher spectral, spatial, temporal and radiometric resolution RS data can play a significant role not only in mapping and monitoring of mangroves but also in rapid assessment of their biodiversity.","",https://doi.org/10.1201/9781003083573-5,"",,
rayyan-210763389,"Detecting a keystone species European aspen in boreal forests with airborne hyperspectral, LiDAR and UAV data with machine learning methods",,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Sustainable forest management increasingly highlights the maintenance of biological diversity and requires up-to-date information on the occurrence and distribution of key ecological features in forest environments. Different proxy variables indicating species richness and quality of the sites are essential for efficient detecting and monitoring forest biodiversity. European aspen (Populus tremula L.) is a minor deciduous tree species with a high importance in maintaining biodiversity in boreal forests. Large aspen trees host hundreds of species, many of them classified as threatened. However, accurate fine-scale spatial data on aspen occurrence remains scarce and incomprehensive.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#160;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We studied detection of aspen using different remote sensing techniques in Evo, southern Finland. Our study area of 83 km&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; contains both managed and protected southern boreal forests characterized by Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.), Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst), and birch (Betula pendula and pubescens L.), whereas European aspen has a relatively sparse and scattered occurrence in the area. We collected high-resolution airborne hyperspectral and airborne laser scanning data covering the whole study area and ultra-high resolution unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) data with RGB and multispectral sensors from selected parts of the area. We tested the discrimination of aspen from other species at tree level using different machine learning methods (Support Vector Machines, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Machine) and deep learning methods (3D convolutional neural networks).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#160;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Airborne hyperspectral and lidar data gave excellent results with machine learning and deep learning classification methods The highest classification accuracies for aspen varied between 91-92% (F1-score). The most important wavelengths for discriminating aspen from other species included reflectance bands of red edge range (724&amp;amp;#8211;727 nm) and shortwave infrared (1520&amp;amp;#8211;1564 nm and 1684&amp;amp;#8211;1706 nm) (Viinikka et al. 2020; M&amp;amp;#228;yr&amp;amp;#228; et al 2021). Aspen detection using RGB and multispectral data also gave good results (highest F1-score of aspen = 87%) (Kuzmin et al 2021). Different remote sensing data enabled production of a spatially explicit map of aspen occurrence in the study area. Information on aspen occurrence and abundance can significantly contribute to biodiversity management and conservation efforts in boreal forests. Our results can be further utilized in upscaling efforts aiming at aspen detection over larger geographical areas using satellite images.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu21-16273,"",,

Current land management challenges, including conserving rare species and habitats, illustrate a growing need for spatially extensive and rapidly updatable biodiversity information; a need that can best be met through remotely sensed imagery combined with the remarkable data processing potential of machine learning. We assess the potential for optical satellite data to classify complex upland habitat types in the Scottish Highlands, following two UK national habitat classification frameworks. We explore how the differences in spatial and spectral resolution of satellite sensors affects the accuracy of derived habitat maps. Specifically, we contrast the performance of open-source Sentinel-2 data (20 m spatial resolution) against higher spatial-resolution data from the commercial Worldview-2 satellite (0.5 m resolution). We then compare the results produced with these satellite datasets against equivalent results obtained with high-resolution (25 cm) colour airborne photographs, to better inform users on the utility of available optical data before subsequent analysis, e.g. natural capital assessments, in comparable settings. We demonstrate that high-fidelity habitat maps (93% overall accuracy) can be produced using high resolution optical satellite data (Worldview-2). This level of accuracy exceeded that of maps derived from airborne surveys (~75%) and is deemed sufficient to be useful to ecologists in-situ. In contrast, the capacity of Sentinel-2 data was considerably more limited (~50% overall accuracy). This highlights the importance of spatial resolution for characterising habitat mosaics at scale, especially in settings such as upland Scotland where shifts in habitat and species composition of importance to land managers may occur at relatively fine length scales (<10m). Provided high spatial resolution optical data is available, the framework developed is scalable to a national scale, therefore, facilitating effective land management strategies","",https://doi.org/10.1117/12.2600869,"",,

This key information is however generally oversimplified in most Earth system models (ESMs) and is typically represented by a number of static, empirically fixed values assigned to a selection of plant functional types (PFTs). This leads to reducing the diversity of plant communities into a relatively low number of categories and key variability within individual PFTs is lost. Subgrid processes are thus underrepresented and accuracy compromised.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The TRY global traits database contains the largest set of in-situ trait observations for numerous species around the globe. Despite the large number of species and samples included in trait databases, such as TRY, they are sparse compared to the overall richness and diversity of species globally. We propose the use of the massive geolocated plant occurrence data from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) as ancillary source of information to better capture species distributions, especially in locations where TRY data are missing.&amp;amp;#160;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As a first order approach, GBIF was used to estimate species abundances for a given study area (contiguous United States), and they were further corrected with high resolution, subpixel maps of PFT derived via remote sensing and machine learning upscaling.&amp;amp;#160; This information was used to provide ecosystem level trait estimates for a selection of plant traits (specific leaf area and leaf nitrogen concentration). The proposed approach allows us to link local biodiversity composition from GBIF with a more precise and realistic representation of plant community composition coming from remote sensing information for ecosystem-level trait estimation. Among many possible applications of these data, the addition of the produced trait estimates to improve ESMs estimations could be very valuable to improve the understanding and monitoring of the biosphere.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;","",https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu21-15835,"",,
rayyan-210763752,Deep Learning Enhances the Detection of Breeding Birds in UAV Images,,1,1,,,,,,,,en,,,"&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Recently, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) equipped with high-resolution imaging sensors have become a viable alternative for ecologists to conduct wildlife censuses, compared to foot surveys. They cause less disturbance by sensing remotely, they provide coverage of otherwise inaccessible areas, and their images can be reviewed and double-checked in controlled screening sessions. However, the amount of data they generate often makes this photo-interpretation stage prohibitively time-consuming.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In this work, we automate the detection process with deep learning [4]. We focus on counting coastal seabirds on sand islands off the West African coast, where species like the African Royal Tern are at the top of the food chain [5]. Monitoring their abundance provides invaluable insights into biodiversity in this area [7]. In a first step, we obtained orthomosaics from nadir-looking UAVs over six sand islands with 1cm resolution. We then fully labelled one of them with points for four seabird species, which required three weeks for five annotators to do and resulted in over 21,000 individuals. Next, we further labelled the other five orthomosaics, but in an incomplete manner; we aimed for a low number of only 200 points per species. These points, together with a few background polygons, served as training data for our ResNet-based [2] detection model. This low number of points required multiple strategies to obtain stable predictions, including curriculum learning [1] and post-processing by a Markov random field [6]. In the end, our model was able to accurately predict the 21,000 birds of the test image with 90% precision at 90% recall (Fig. 1) [3]. Furthermore, this model required a mere 4.5 hours from creating training data to the final prediction, which is a fraction of the three weeks needed for the manual labelling process. Inference time is only a few minutes, which makes the model scale favourably to many more islands. In sum, the combination of UAVs and machine learning-based detectors simultaneously provides census possibilities with unprecedentedly high accuracy and comparably minuscule execution time.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;img src=&amp;quot;https://contentmanager.copernicus.org/fileStorageProxy.php?f=gnp.bc5211f4f60067568601161/sdaolpUECMynit/12UGE&amp;amp;app=m&amp;amp;a=0&amp;amp;c=eeda7238e992b9591c2fec19197f67dc&amp;amp;ct=x&amp;amp;pn=gnp.elif&amp;amp;d=1&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Fig. 1: Our model is able to predict over 21,000 birds in high-resolution UAV images in a fraction of time compared to weeks of manual labelling.&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#160;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;References&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;1.

Characterizing those communities in terms of species diversity and species abundance is part of investigating soil functions and response to perturbation. Dozens to hundreds of specimens can be extracted from a sample that need to be sorted, counted and identified. It involves an enormous amount of time, straining the workflow of soil zoologists. Deep learning‐based computer vision approaches have become increasingly popular to monitor biodiversity, as they can be applied to detect, count and classify organisms. In this work, we present CollembolAI, an open‐source prototype for a computer vision workflow. It includes a hardware system for acquiring high‐resolution pictures of soil species samples in fluid and a deep learning‐based application (Faster R‐CNN with Slicing Aided Hyper Inference) to train and evaluate models for the detection and classification of animals on those pictures. We evaluated the workflow using a mix of specimens belonging to 12 species of springtail and mite, picked from our taxonomic collection. Specimens were photographed multiple times under various angle of views. The model was trained using 5671 views on specimens on 30 images and tested on 442 views from new specimens on six images. CollembolAI is affordable, simple to build and allows the rapid digitization of mesofauna samples. Our deep learning model achieved a Precision of 0.940, Recall of 0.918 and a mAP@0.5 (Pascal VOC) of 0.868. The model showed a lower Recall for one species, but was performant on all others. Our prototype offers an operational workflow for the creation of soil fauna picture datasets needed to develop efficient deep learning‐based classifiers. The applications are numerous, for example, collection digitization, soil biodiversity analysis and monitoring, or automatic assessment of mesofauna‐based bioindicators. Computer vision is a rapidly emerging tool to handle efficiently the complexity of biodiversity and is already successfully used for plants and vertebrates recognition of pictures.

However, recent drier conditions of Poyang Lake are having a profound impact on its wetland vegetation leading to degradation of the entire wetland ecosystem, thereby also threatening the winter habitat of migratory birds. We aim to develop an integrated framework to quantitatively investigate the spatial distribution of major herbaceous communities that provide habitat for the migratory birds in response to Poyang Lake flood inundation. First, ground references are obtained from a combination of drone imagery and field surveys as an input for the wetland herbaceous community classification model. Our classification model is based on a machine learning technique applied to Sentinel-2 satellite data. This new search strategy provides an accurate classification based on the more optimal input variables and model parameters gained simultaneously. Secondly, based on the dynamic changes in water levels since 2000, we statistically evaluate the key environmental drivers of the hydrological regime on the spatial distribution of the wetland vegetation communities. This showed that: 1) different plant communities exhibited varying tolerance to flood inundation and 2) two key factors, i.e., average water depth and average duration of the inundation events, were found to be able to characterize the communities&amp;amp;#8217; tolerance independently.
